it was a toss up between naked crab & claw daddies i chose naked crab due to location we parked at the mall next to restaurant  $3 00 for 3 hours entered and was greeted at the door  we made it just before happy hour so we got the cajun wings  grilled oyster & some drinks the drinks were tasty and cute in those baggies the food was tasty  nothing bland everything full of flavor we got the shrimp and snow crab boil we added sausages  we got plenty of sausage but each bag only had half a potato and half a cob of corn  needed more due to that awesome taste of the boil bag  they had an array of sauce and spice level  medium was perfect enjoyable to give a kick but not overwhelm and take over  i would come back  i would recommend there was a few patrons from different cultures  i never felt awkward  give it a try 
here again for happy hour there are three of us and they sat us at a 4 top in the middle of the room two 4 tops opened up in the corners and we asked if we could move to one of those  at this point we had only ordered one beer we were told no because it is a busy night and they don't want to move us that was about 8 mins ago one of the 4 tops has already filled but the other one is still empty all we wanted to do was move from one 4 top to another in a different location i don't see the issue plus again  while i was typing this we put in our order and the waitress came back and said they were out of the sauce he ordered this has happened in the past as you can see from my first review of this place  oops   2 more 4 tops just opened i don't like spending my money at places that aren't willing to accomadate me at all it feels yucky it wasn't an unreasonable request and  too many times i've been here we have ordered and minutes later they come back and we are told they are out of what we ordered edited 30 mins later and the place is about 50% full and they even sat 2 people at one of those corner 4 tops  when the waitress came by and asked if everything was ok  it felt a bit like a slap in the face 
this seafood spot has fresh seafood ranging from your raw oysters  lobster  crawfish  crab and everything you can imagine from the sea  this place looks very modern with nice large booth  tables and a bar  this is great for a group gathering enjoying fresh seafood bags filled with your favorite seafood  every boil bag comes with corn  potatoes and rice cakes along with your favorite type of sauces  you pay the boils by the lb  and every single one comes fresh to your table with gloves  plenty of paper towels and a bucket for your shells  my party and i got crawfish which was very good but very minimal for the price you pay for the amount of meat you get from the tails  we got the shabang sauce that was so flavorful! i wish i could put that over some rice and i can call it a meal! the corn was sweet  potatoes and rice cake soaks up all the sauce  the garlic butter shrimp was great as well  they all come with the head on and you can just slurp the juice from the head which is the best part  the wings were pretty good but it was a dry rub and could use some type of sauce  it was crunchy and juicy as well  no complaints here  the fried calamari was crispy and hot but nothing special here  the sweet and spicy  and tomato sauce it came with it was a nice compliment to the calamari  the cajun fries are a pass because of the portion size for the price you pay  overall a great experience to get your hands dirty and enjoy great company exploring a delicious seafood boil bag 
i wasn't sure what to expect coming to naked crab; first and foremost  it was a lengthy trek for me  especially on easter sunday  but the menu was tempting and the reviews were positive  so i made the 1 5 hour trek out the restaurant is located just a short walk from main street flushing and located within the same building as a hotel  the interior is very spacious  with a few booths for larger groups and plenty of two tops  i was quickly greeted by a server and given my choice of seating  and he was also kind enough to walk me through their menu and make suggestions  the strength of their menu is in their seafood boils  which allows you to pick your choice of seafood (shrimp  crab  lobster  etc ) and sauce   but the rest of the menu has some tempting seafood focused entrees and appetizers as well  from the starters  i would recommend their creamy mac and cheese as well as the cajun wings  which have a slightly spicy seasoning and a crispy outer skin  they're all crowd pleasers  and would make for great bar snacks  from the heavier dishes  don't overlook the softshell crab burger  which is served with a poached egg and avocado  as well as a side of crisp fries   i also got to try the crawfish boil in their signature naked sauce  which is spicy  savory  and tart either the addition of lemon  and came with corn and potatoes to help round out the boil  also   they have a stunning uni pasta and seared duck breast which i'd recommend to anyone looking for more unique  elevated dishes that you wouldn't find elsewhere in flushing would love to return with a bigger group to try out more of the menu  but definitely glad i made the trek to flushing!
so first let me say my family is picky! the service was great  food was delicious  a lot of places i go to  only the server will help you  but here  anyone we saw was asking if we needed anything  we had lemonades & first kiss to drink  all were good  for starters  shrimp cocktail  cajun fries  & lobster mac & cheese  to eat my father had salmon which he said was perfectly seasoned and cooked  my mother & i shared 2lbs of snow crab & 2lbs of headless shrimp in garlic butter  i also had a pound of crawfish cajun  everything tasted fresh & cooked perfectly  even the corn & potatoes  the atmosphere is nice  not too loud but still nice for a family with a 1 year old  we will be back  just wish there was more parking options but that isn't their fault  we parked at the mall around the corner  paid $3 which isn't bad at all but it was a bit of a walk for my mother who uses a cane 
i came here on valentine's day and made reservations just in case this place was packed   it was packed   you can make reservations via yelp and set up a reminder text email which is convenient  ordered the bone marrow pasta  two boils (shrimp and mussels) and (lobster and clams)   the boils were covered in mild "naked sauce" which is a combination of all their sauces that they have   the food was hot and not overcooked   the downside of my visit was we waited almost an hour for our boil   not sure why it took that long  perhaps my order was forgotten or the kitchen was extra busy   our waiter was apologetic and gave us a green tea tiramisu on the house  which was definitely a nice touch and made us forgive them for the long wait the naked crab is spacious and a nice restaurant to bring a date   i'll be coming back soon to try other items on their menu 
loved this place ! the food was so yummy   decor modern and clean   staff very friendly   my favorite dish was the uni pasta  aweeeemazing  very creative drinks and cocktail menu  would definitely go back
was craving for cajun seafood so i yelped around and found this place  tried and might not come back again hh oyster  5 5 very fresh  1$ each sliders  4 5 comes with short rib  fried oyster and eel  short rib was very flavorful  fried oyster needs more work  lack of flavor    needs some sauce or seasoning  feel like it's simmered rather than fried  eel was delicious with the eel sauce  shrimp w  shabang sauce  3 5 5 the shrimps was tiny and the portion was soo small    doesn't look like 1lb at all  came w corns and potato w  no additional charge  the shabang sauce was delicious    has a nice lemon spicy kick to it; recommend getting trying the sauce snow crab legs w  garlic butter  2 5 5 the legs was super tiny   there were barely any meat inside  one of my friend leg didn't have any meat at all  garlic butter sauce has a very intense garlic smell but was lack of flavor  very disappointed experience  for the food  portion size and the service it wasn't worth the overall total  there were 3 servers on the floor and it wasn't busy at all but it was soo hard to flag down someone   not too sure if we came on the wrong night but never coming back for the boil at all  probably just for the hh oysters 
this place is okay  i haven't been to much boils but i had better  also  better homemade of course  tried the garlic noodles  not the best  but still tasty  especially for those who loves cheese  they put a good amount of parmesan on top  to the point it overpowers the garlic taste and kind of drying?grilled corn with cheese  get it  it's different from your mexican style elote but similar  i liked the mayo they used  something that really popped out  for the boil  i think it was decently priced  not sure  they didn't have crawfish because it wasnt in season  noooooooooooo  what's the point of a boil if not crawfish?! tell me  so i got clams and mussels  pound each  i couldn't afford or didn't want the other stuff  i got it in cajun spicy  cajun flavor was weird  it wasn't bad  but not the cajun i know  unless the spicy made it taste off  speaking of spicy  the spicy is spicy! but goes away decently fast when you're done eating  can't believe i was thinking about getttjnf the carolina reaper spice  i should've gotten medium  i wasn't able to enjoy my boil after finishing 2 3 because i was getting the sniffles  service seems like a hit or miss here  our waitress seemed to ignore us or walk passed up several times and we are trying to get her attention without being rude  wasn't busy either  but this guy refilled my water and even popped in a straw for me because he saw me struggling  he was really nice  i don't like how you have to order full pounds or don't have a deal or combo set (at least not that i know of)   i would come back for happy hour and maybe try butter garlic next time 
i'm still thinking about the grilled clams i had two days ago  so good! the oysters (blue points) were very fresh  the grilled oysters were probably my least favorite  happy hour is very worth it here  the sauce (naked sauce) for the boil was also really good as well  it's a mix of 3 of their sauces including garlic butter and lemon pepper  glad i found a local spot i can come to in flushing for fresh seafood  also the creme brûlée is amazing surprisingly!parking sucks but it's flushing so it is what it is  service is a bit slow  the servers were very nice  perhaps they were understaffed?
1  come in for happy hr bc 1$ oysters and chicken are always great! the grilled oysters are soo addicting and drinks are actually really good  i normally feel a little something something after the 1st one but i always end up getting another one haha  must be the alcoholic in me   2  we ordered 2 lbs of shrimp in the mild naked sauce but we should of gotten medium naked sauce bc we like a little kick but still great 3  foir graas was good but everytime i get it i do not eat the apple sauce thats underneath it  if u dont like fatty stuff dont get it 4  truffle pasta was a nice touch  they freshly grate it in front of you  tip  stir it and let it sit for a min nd the truffle taste will really come thru 5  lamb and steak was also great  ordered it in a medium rare  cooked to perfection 6  the 10$ a piece kobe wagyu risoto was amazing  they come and torch the beef infront of you and sprinkle a little bit of salt  just something everyone needs to try 7  green tea tiramisu was good it was really thick    like unexpectedly thick  but non the less it was good not the best 8  green tea brule is my go to at any rest  the brule here i gotta say isnt the best  the glass jar they prepare it in isnt quite ideal  i think its too much    the ratio of the sugar on top to the egg custard is off  i think if they changed the container and make the egg custard a little less then it would be perfecttt 
i called two days before for the reservation  someone misplaced my reservation for a party of four  the original date was april 2  2018; i had to go again on april 6  2018  i was unhappy with the service  food was okay  my party members  had to accommodate their schedule for the original reservation date  not cool  but the lobster was good  every one in my party loved the lobster  great décor 
nothing special here   i should of known better when i saw the extensive menu   i came with party of 6   the place is small  inside of the parc hotel flushing  we started with oysters   even though they had about over 20 kinds of oyster posted  they only had 5 available   2 people in our group order oysters  about 2 dozen total   when the oyster came out  it was 5 minutes between the 2 dozens   the place was not busy and they had 3 servers so why they couldn't bring it together boggles the mind   also the oysters were totally tasteless!  waste of money here!for the main course we ordered 2 lbs of shrimp and 1lb of squid with the house sauce medium spice   if you ever had "boils" before  you know the sauce is everything!   well  the sauce here is underwhelming   it was too much tomato and not enough butter   i tried my friend garlic butter and it was bitter  too much cajun seasoning   on top of that  the squid they used was like the left overs from cleaning the squid this place is very disappointing so go to shaking crab few blocks away and skip this impostor!
came on tonight looking for sea urchin sashimi  although it was up on the menu they had none  totally upsetting  service was ok  nothing great  we had a sampler of oysters west coast and east coast  2 dz for the table of 6ppl  the oysters were too cold  so cold that we all agreed that we couldnt really taste the flavor of each oyster individually   we ordered 2lbs of the shrimp and 1 pound of squid all boild with mild sauce on the side   the boil came with potato  corn and rice cakes  imo the rice cake was a filler and the squid was more like the left overs of the day  the star of the boil were the shrimp   overall our bill was about $325 b4 tip  server was nice  most likely this will be a 1 time deal  highly overrated 
this is one of my favorite restaurant in flushing  i think people love this kind of food will really love this place but oppositely will not come back again  i went here multiple times with different people  a few say not their cup of tea would not come back  some really love it  you have to give it a try  i love not just their boil seafood and raw seafood  i also love their dishes like the duck salad is my favorite  surprisingly the dessert also not bad  the price is relatively high compare to flushing chinese restaurant  i would say $40 50 is needed per one person if you want eat a variety of different of food  can not come very often or will hurt my poor wallet ha  but definitely one of my recommended place in flushing 
this place is great   came with my family and we enjoyed everything  they had a seafood bag with crab legs   shrimp and all the sides  i had the lamb chops and they were awesome   a big thank you to our waitress amanda was excellent 
restaurant has about 15 tables   foie gras was ok  uni pasta was decent   raw clam was a little sandy and decent   raw oysters were fresh   we liked the flavorful bone marrow a lot   good service 
i had the most random craving for a boil and yelped some around the area  i was intrigued by the reviews and pictures   i bookmarked naked crab and patiently waited for a good evening to come by for their happy hour (everyday of the week from 4pm 7pm)  it was very easy to make reservations via the yelp app  in fact i made the reservation less than an hour before i went on a sunday and every reservation time was available  nice!we arrived at 5 30pm and it was completely empty  it did start to fill up shortly after 6pm though  ambience is great  music was loud enough to drown out yelling babies but low enough to be able to have a conversation  very children friendly and even had high chairs  regular menus are given and a qr code which you can scan with your smartphone to see images of the food on the menu  they do not give a happy hour menu so be sure to ask about what they have  apparently it is written outside but i didn't pay attention  happy hour had some great deals such as $1 raw oysters  $1 50 grilled oysters or clams  $1 cajun wings  and some drink specials  we ordered 12 raw oysters  12 grilled oysters and 6 clams  8 cajun wings  garlic noodles  bone marrow pasta  clam pasta  shrimp boil with garlic butter sauce  and the garlic bread  all that plus one soda costed us $150 after tax and tip  this is to share amongst 3 people and it was just about right in terms of the amount of food   raw oysters  decent size  fresh  so worth it   grilled oysters clams  these were very yummy  i surprisingly preferred the clams because it was more meaty  ugh  writing this review is making me hungry   cajun wings  these were good  $1   what's not to like?!  garlic noodles  yelp did not do me wrong  these were highly recommended in the reviews and it was dee licious  best of all the noodles and pasta dishes we ordered without a doubt   bone marrow pasta  the bone marrow were roasted well  buttery  flavorful  the pasta itself was slightly overcooked and the sauce tasted like from a can of chef boyardee  not worth the price tag  stick with the seafood   clam pasta  these were just okay  nothing special  again  not worth the price tag    shrimp boil with garlic butter  one pound of shrimp came with one piece of corn  i wish the boils come with sausages without the extra cost  sauce was tasty   garlic bread  these were sad little creatures  absolutely not worth $5  not enough garlic on it to be remotely garlicky  but honestly people probably order this to dip in the boil sauce anyway  never again the service was absolutely fantastic  everyone was very friendly and there were plenty of smiles to go around  we were greeted as we came in and thanked as we left   i really felt appreciated as a customer! i was a little upset at one point though when someone took away the boil sauce when i turned around because i was still dipping the garlic bread in it  saaadd face  i would definitely come back in the future when i am craving some good seafood  but probably only when the happy hour is in effect because they have some really good deals  the regular menu prices are not cheap to say the least  luckily  there is a 5% cash back for dining here if using a credit card you've registered on yelp!
it's not a secret that i love seafood   but this place didn't do it for me overall   i did have a nice meal but was disappointed at the quality of seafood i ordered   the regular snow crab legs were way frozen so it tasted more like the ice water   on that alone  i would have given this place 2 5 stars but they did redeem themselves with other menu items   my bestie and i ordered the bone marrow and chicken wings   yes  neither were seafood dishes   the bone marrow was good     nothing special but still worth mentioning for those that want to try it   the chicken wings were flavorful but not memorable   at any rate  wasn't here to eat that stuff   we also had the baked scallop and baked oysters which were pretty big (shell size) and the meat was fairly plump with good seasoning   that was one of the highlights for the night   and of course  we ordered a lobster boil (served steamed in a plastic bag with corn on the cob)   my bestie wanted the lemon pepper flavor given she wanted to avoid the usual butter flavor the funniest thing  the best item of the night was the coconut dessert!  it was a coconut pudding served right in the coconut shell   very delicious and refreshing after that meal   it is also huge   enough to share but we both wanted our own   loloh  one mention  i thought it was funny that i had ordered a passion fruit green tea drink and it was served in a pouch (not a cup)   like a capri sun packaging only clear   it was a large serving too i don't know if i would rush to return but if i do  i'll be sure to go when the seafood is more in season (this was mid october) and go w  more people so i can sample more stuff   (my friends went previously and had a better tasting experience than i did) 
saddest happy hour  after ordering a dozen $1 oysters  we tried ordering a second round  the waitress told us they ran out of blue points but we can pay full price for the other oysters they have    must have been lying to us because we were the only diners in the restaurant and somehow we ate through all the hh oysters?? and it was just bad customer service to offer us no other option but to pay for $3 oysters i was excited to find a place that serves oysters by my home but i was not impressed  they weren't as fresh as other reviewers have mentioned  we also tried the grilled oysters and they were pretty tasty  i'll give them that 
came here with the family and was able to park right out front  we got a seafood boil with shrimp and crab legs  tasty but not memorable  got the cheesy lobster as well and too expensive in my opinion  the foie gras was good  but the wings seemed over fried  food was decent  but not spectacular  and due to the high price point  probably won't be coming back 
this place has one of the best services i've experience  friendly wait staff and informative of specials and promotions  food is on point  we came during happy hour and raw blue point oysters were fresh and sweet  tried the grilled oysters and the jumbo grilled oysters as part of their promotion and i gotta say it was delicious! it hit the spot from raw to grill! ordered some appetizers  garlic bread went well with the grilled oysters and of course the steam shrimps!! had grilled corn too and mac n cheese  environment was family friendly  low lit lighting and casual  happy hour was great with drinks!! i gave it a 5 star because of service  it matters a lot to have a friendly staff  and of course the food was great and tasteful! to add to it  we also had the eel burger and it was the best!we would have added photos of our main dish but the food just look so delicious we forgot to take the main course photos!!
we arrived on a saturday night  at around 8pm so we had just missed happy hour  regardless  we ordered a dozen oysters  6 kumamoto & 6 blue point  the kumamotos are smaller  meatier and a have a pleasant sweetness to it  which i loved  the oysters were fresh and sand less! we also ordered 2 grilled corns  which is basically mexican elote  and it was so yummy and cheesy  lastly  we got a side of cajun fries and they were fried to perfection; super crunchy outside yet soft on the inside  as for the boils  we got 1lb of crawfish  you can choose the spice level  mild  medium or spicy  and the sauce  we opted for the 'shabang' sauce  as per the recommendation of our waiter  and boyyyyy was it spicy  if you cannot tolerate spicy foods  please do not get this  both of our mouths were on fire  in addition  we got the snow crab combo  which consisted of 1lb of snow crab and  your choice of 1 2lb of  shrimp  clams or crawfish  we opted for the shrimp  and this time got the garlic butter sauce  which was a nice cool down from the 'shabang ' service was pretty good for a restaurant in flushing  i was pleasantly surprised  prices are average for a seafood spot like itself  and i'm glad i don't have to travel to the city for cajun style seafood  definitely will return during hh!
first time here and decided to test the waters with their happy hour     it was great!very fresh and relatively large oysters by majority and the drinks weren't watered down   so two martinis was great to unwind 
the music is good  drink isn't bad  the food is good too  i can't complain much  it's okay  not anything amazing  it's a good date place or with a group 
my friends and i came here on a thursday night around 10pm and the place was pretty empty  i had had this $30 coupon for months and finally decided to use it  so this restaurant is actually on the first floor of a hotel  it's spacious with lots of fishing theme decoration  the menu starts with raw bar  so the usuals  oysters  clams  crab legs    appetizers  soup  salad  a couple of pasta  they also have a full bar and lots of cocktails  we started off with an oyster sample plate  which had 6 oysters  it was okay to me  i prefer the small ones  we had grilled clams  shrimp avocado salad  and mushroom cream soup  grilled clams were fine  the salad was kinda weird and i don't like it  the soup was too oily  the squid ink pasta with seafood was odd and a bit sour  overall i think the food was dissapointing  the owner was really nice tho  but sadly i wouldn't come bank  p s  lots of clean  roomy restrooms for you ladies
grilled oysters  place and service 5 stars 55555555555555555555 55555555555555555555555555                                                                                                                                           
this place has happy hour! last time we got the grilled oysters and wings  they also offer a free "jumbo" oyster if you share their video via facebook  i thought the actual boil was ok  found it lacking in flavor  the waiters are friendly and attentive though  fries are on point as well as their burger 
the service was great  but i thought the portions to be extra small for the pricing  after the appetizers we ordered crab legs and shrimp  both of which  tasted great  but it only had a 2" piece of corn and half of a potato in the boil  hardly enough to subsidize all that seafood 
this is a cool place to check out once  i came sometime in the first week of january 2018  it is a nice restaurant if you were staying in the hotel that it is connected to but with so many similar cuisines in walking distance nothing really stands out with this place  it's a cajun seafood place but i was unimpressed by the saucethe lobster mac and cheese was very cute  it came with in a cute hotplate  the cajun wings tasted good but nothing specialthe best part for me was the oyster sampler which i asked the waiter which oyster was which  when he got back to me it was rather rushed and very low so i was unable to clearly hear what he said ordered for a family of 4 appetizer  mac and cheese lobster and cajun wingsraw bar  oyster sampler (6)entree  some unmemorable pastaboil  2 pound of seafood and 1 pound of mussels
this restaurant is definitely a little out of the way from the crowded area of flushing but if you're already doing some shopping at skyview  consider coming here for dinner afterwards  also  consider parking in skyview because it's almost impossible to find street parking nearby ($3 for 3 hours) it wasn't very crowded when my party of 3 arrived on a sunday night for happy hour  and when i left at around 8pm  there were still a few empty tables  regardless if it's crowded  it's a spacious restaurant and it looks like they can accommodate big parties  happy hour is everyday from 5 7pm and so worth it  they have a good selection of $6 cocktails  $1 fried wings and oysters and $1 50 grilled oysters  they have a lot of options on their menu so it's not just seafood  but obviously  we had to get the seafood boils because we wanted the full experience of eating with gloves  a bib and getting messy! we ordered a pound of snow crab and clams combo with the naked crab sauce  it was delicious!! the sauce had a kick to it but it was not overwhelming and not too salty  the snow crabs were very meaty and came right off  we ended up ordering some cajun fries to dip into the naked crab sauce  so good!the service was fast and efficient  i highly recommend this restaurant if you're craving for seafood or the boil  but you don't want to travel all the way to manhattan and wait 40 minutes for a table 
located next to skyview mall  parking available outside  but can only fit around 4 5 cars  meanwhile they can seat probably close to 100 ppl inside   you can make reservations on yelp  but actually didnt need to make any  table for 5 ppl on a saturday 6pm  and we were practically the 3rd group inside   food  calamari parmesian corn 1 lb shrimp boil (garlic butter)dungeness crab + crawfish (naked sauce) garlic noodlescajun friesive had better sauce for the cajun seafood bags  but thats not to say it was bad here  for us  we didnt think it was enough sauce and it didnt stick well to the seafood  not a big deal  just dip it into the bag again after peeling  the garlic noodles were delicious! we ended up getting another one of those at the end  very spacious  and lots of tables and room to walk  the staff is friendly and patient  i just wish that there were more televisions other than the 3 right next to each other at the bar  i wanted to follow the mets game while i was eating 
i had such a great time here the staff were friendly and attentive; my friend and i were seated right away when happy hour started and there were only a few other people in there happy hour specials include 6 dollar cocktails  5 dollar beer wine  1 dollar oysters and 1 50 baked clams mussels  the cocktails are game of thrones themed and come in an adult capri sun bad so they stay untainted and grabbable while you eat  if you're a tequila fan  i highly recommend the red wedding  if you're into vodka? hit a khaleesi  both were tasty and well poured  (props to the bartender  who was also friendly  thanks!)we ordered oysters and baked clams as appetizers  simple and delicious  we ordered a 2lb boil bag and were not disappointed  we went with the garlic butter and mild spice and the clams  crawfish and shrimp were all phenomenal  there was more than enough to take home for left overs too   to which they included a pair of gloves we finished off with creme brûlée and coconut pudding   both were excellent  the coconut is served cold in a coconut  and was delicious  the creme brûlée is warm and just perfect overall  had a great time  will be coming back for my birthday dinner next month  can't wait!
the happy hour is great! $1 oysters are incredibly fresh and all the drinks are extremely tasty on the regular menu  i don't think you can go wrong with anything  i've been here a couple of times  and have tried almost everything  the black truffle pasta  along with the steak and the rack of lamb are marvelous  everything is cooked to perfection and all the sauces are so delicious they'll leave you wanting more as for the boils  my favorite sauce is hands down the black pepper sauce  although it's $2 extra  it's worth every single penny  other than the black pepper sauce  the naked sauce is another one of my personal favorites  i would definitely come back and 100% recommend it to all my friends
while checking out new restaurants in flushing  naked crab was one of them and there was a groupon deal so i decided check it out  the restaurant was new and clean  i ordered lobster combo boil with medium garlic butter sauce (i usually get spicy but the waiter said the medium level is spicy so i followed with his advice  which turned out to be a smart choice   even the medium level is spicy)  hoping that it's as good as the one i had at the boil restaurant in manhattan  unfortunately  i couldn't see any chunks of garlic and i tasted lots of curry flavor  i'm not saying it was bad  it just wasn't as good as i expected  as for the customer service  the servers didn't come out of the kitchen area often so i had to wait to ask for a bill  i also had to ask for a crab fork so that it's easier to eat the lobster meat  but shouldn't the server have a common sense and bring it out with the dish before i ask? nonetheless  i'm still giving 4 stars because the food was decent and the servers were nice when i got to talk to them  definitely order a bowl of rice ($3) to mix with the sauce if you order the book menu!
love the environment and the food  during happy hour  don't miss the $1 oyster and their garlic noodles are so delicious! my girlfriends and i often meet here after work for some drinks and the cajun dishes  dig in
cuisine  7service  6decor  7value  6overall  7just another cajun boil restaurant? not really  the chef here must have been professionally trained because he makes great fancy appetizers and entrees that most other boils don't  obviously most people come in here for the big bags of seafood  but i wouldn't ignore rest of the great food on the menu so far  i have been here twice in 3 days and here are the things we have tried foie gras   8 seared well  but rest of plate just okmuchroom soup   8 creamy & flavorful  excellentraw oysters   7 good east & west cost selectionlobster sashimi   7 fresh but soy sauce was too saltyprime sirloin steak   7 very juicy but a bit priceyshrimp boil   7 large shrimps  garlic butter yumsnow crab boil   6 little bit overcooked but decentking crab boil   3 definitely overcooked & overpricedfood and decor are the strong points at this restaurant  where they are somewhat weaker is service and price  actually  the owner  hostess and bartenders were extremely friendly  unfortunately their servers are quite forgetful (again  lemons for the oysters please ) and don't come around to check us regularly (water glasses were always empty)  as for the price  most of it seems reasonable  but $38 for the sirloin seems steep when i can go to a manhattan steakhouse and get a much larger portion for a few dollars more  also  other cajun boil places price their king crab legs around $28 33 lb  why so high?anyway  minor complaints aside  i do like the ambiance (minus the really loud music) and the variety of food available for a restaurant in downtown flushing  considering there is skyview mall parking right on the next block  it's likely that naked crab will see me again in the near future 
not typically a seafood person  but their food was delicious  must say though  my favorite thing was the lobster mac n cheese!
must try their grilled lobster with cheese and the duck breast also the rack of lamb! there's so many other things i'd like to try from their menu but i'm still obsessed with those three dishes  so i usually end up ordering those every time i go  the service is satisfactory and the place is clean! they offer a variety of seafood and they are all fresh   what more can u ask for?
let me start by saying  i love a good boil! so when my mom first mentioned me about naked crab  i was on the fence about it because finding a place that has awesome food  boils is tricky to find in queens  i made a yelp reservation for 4 (because no body likes to wait) and the second we got there  we were seated!  what we ordered   dozen oysters  shrimp cocktail (5 per order  we had to order another)  garlic noodles (it was so good  we ordered one more)  three snow crab + shrimp boil ( garlic butter + cajun sauce) *check out my tip below!  one lobster + shrimp boil (cajun spicy) the ambiance is great  they play great music  the staff is super attentive and great knowledge about their raw fish my mom asked if they clean the lobster before serving it  and they don't (bummer) what they do is  boil the completed lobster as a whole and serve it as is  you can ask them to cut it down the middle though  the boils itself were very tasty! however the sauce didn't stick much to the shrimp and crabs that after cracking and cleaning  i found myself dipping the crab meat into the sauce  i mean who doesn't love drenching their food into bomb ass sauce  i can keep going  but an over all great experience and will defiantly be going back!
this place is consistently good  i've been here around 10 times now and the salmon  boils  lobster roll  and lamb are all very good! i especially recommend the shabang sauce for the boil  very tasty today i tried the squid ink pasta with seafood  it was okay but the mussels literally seemed like they were taken off the beach and thrown straight into the pasta; sand and all  i could understand a bit of sand but this was a mouthful of sand  hopefully they fix this issue because everything else is great the male waiter we had was also extremely friendly and attentive!
i love seafood  always interested in trying boils and steam pots  heard about this place  lucky for me groupon had a deal  we made reservations (just in case)  the place is nice and cozy  staff were attentive  the drinks were yummy  i ordered a khalessi which was so good  light  crisp and sweet  for their boils  they have a few choices for sauces and heat level  i chose the spiciest cajun  it was pretty hot  extra $2 but worth it if you you love heat  a lb of crab legs were ordered  heat level of just "spicy" which was really good  the shrimp are larger than that of joe's crab shack  the crab had enough meat  they give you gloves to eat with  i rolled my eyes about it but my hands felt the heat after  my hands burned for 2 days after dinning in  that's how hot the carolina option was  (i love spice so worth it for me)  i would def go again 
i will give them credit for a nice ambiance      the food does taste pretty good  i just wish it was a bit more food and that they had more veggie options  the waiters were nice and offered us a promo go like the a photo from a free oyster   it was a huge oyster   im sure if i ate oysters it would be awesome  we got it anyway  it was seasoned real well  it was a nice place to try  the wings were delicious and they put lightbup ice cubes in your drink  cute 
decided to give this place a try and i was so disappointed  literally came in  sat  and left  came here with a few seafood cravings and they had none  nope  how can a seafood restaurant not have seafood??? probably why the place was empty since they had no seafood 
awesome place! loved the seasoning! the service was great  the waitress came back several times to make sure we was okay  the price was reasonable and worth it  i definitely will go there again  the place is very spacious and comfortable 
awesome food  awesome service  must do again! we shared the bone marrow  lamb dish and a boil of snowcrab with sausage yum!
had great time here  it was intimate  quite  wound out staying for like two hours  it was rainy and icy out so we were literally 1 of 4 tables being used our entire stay  the staff was friendly  attentive  all in all an enjoyable experience  my only criticisms are (and this one likely can't be helped) the aroma of all the seafood is extremely potent  it can literally knock you off your feet! second critique is their choice of paper menus  they were smudges and food stains on them  overall that's just esthetically unappealing  and it comes off as cheap  and the menus also lack pictures of any kind  the food served looks great  why not incapacitate that?!
my husband and i have been here couple times  the food is always consistently good!  i always asked the servers for recommendation and they never disappointed 
came here purposefully for the happy hour  i had quite a few raw and grilled oysters that were so good and fresh  i only thought the grilled ones were a little bit salty  i would still get it again  i also got the shrimp cocktail which i don't think i would get again  it was decent  not bad but not great either  overall  i enjoyed my experience 
i came here before 5pm   after i walked in  i was not seemingly welcomed   no greetings by anyone in the restaurant   the owner just put me in the corner   i had to wait and wave at the waiter to get my order   but it's only until i finished my food  i realized i was never given anything not even water to drink   he never asked me   after he took my order and told me no problem full filling it he only came back later to tell me they don't have it   i don't believe it because they just opened at 4pm and it's a holiday they must prepare for it   i don't believe they don't have sea urchin for the whole night   my guess is they are leaving it to group customers later who booked the table for expensive package price   also  they cancel the happy hour specials just by saying because it's a holiday   it really sucks that i had to deal with this nonsense   food is ok very small portion   lousy service   i left with an empty stomach   will only return if there is promotion   my suggestion to the restaurant is   if you can not afford a promotion  then don't do it at all   please don't play the customers then nickel and dime your gain or loss 
loved this place! i ordered the sky view drink and it was delicious ! i ended up having 2and i order a snow crab leg and headless shrimp in garlic butter sauce medium it came with corn and potatoes i loved it! it was so flavorful i was very pleased with the mealalso my waiter and waitress where great! nice and didn't seem like i bothered them when i called them over only bad side was the $1 wings kinda sucked and there's barely parking but even with those cons i would so go back again!
i came here one evening with a friend of mine for dinner  when we arrived  it was fairly empty  but it got more and more crowded as time passed  they were also hosting a party of some sort as well  at times  it was hard to talk because it was so loud  we got an order of garlic bread  a dozen oysters for appetizers  the eel burger and lobster mac & cheese  i loved the garlic bread and eel burger  the lobster mac & cheese didn't have a lot of lobster  but it was still delicious  the oysters ended up making my friend nauseous and caused stomach pain after a few hours 
love   simply love the food here    seafood is absolutely fresh which is really important to me !!  took my 16 years old nephew here   and he enjoyed so much    he is such a picky eater as most of the 16 years olders    but he said that this is one of his favorite!
we were craving for cajun seafood but plans didn't work out so we had to make dinner plans around queens  i ordered eat24 for pick up at naked crab and everything went smooth  the guy at the door greeted me and directed me to the bar for pick up  honestly  the food wasn't really as good as the boil  we ordered the calamari appetizer  it was mostly breading and too salty  we also got 2lbs of shrimp with the cajun sauce  it was lacking flavor and not as tasty as i hoped  maybe we'll try a different sauce next time but definitely not the cajun 
the best uni pasta and duck salad i've ever tried in my life!!! came here on a wednesday night with my friends and we were impressed with everything   we ordered raw oysters   cajun fries   garlic bread  avacado salad  duck salad  uni pasta  2 pounds snow crab legs and shrimp  staffs were extremely friendly they also have happy hours from 4pm to 7pm   if you are in flushing and don't know where to go  give naked crab a try! this is a true gem!  i'm definitely coming back again!
booked this place via yelp on the same day for a party of 3 for 8 30pm  this was for a friday evening dinner  i have never been to this place or any other seafood boil places to begin with  i didnt have any expectations or whatsoever   we drove up to the restaurant and to our surprise  there is actually parking  there is about 5 6 (or less actually) spots on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant  friday night dinners in flushing is no joke when trying to find a parking spot  we attempted street parking and if there wasnt a parking lot space  we would have went to sky view  its only 2 blocks away  we walk in  and it was practically empty  the place was bigger than i expected and i certainly thought it would have been packed being friday night and prime time dinner time  but thats not to say the place isnt good that people are not returning  we get to a table and check the menu  staff was pretty friendly  you choose your seafood or choice and the sauce you want  its self explanatory  there was 3 of us so we ordered 3 different kinds of seafood and sauce  snow crab legs in garlic butter   this was probably my favorite of the three sauce  garlic and butter combo is good on anything actaully  its a sauce combo that cannot go wrong  red crab in shabang sauce   this is their spicy sauce  which is mainly made of sriracha  it was ok  the meat on the red crab was a tab mushy  i wasnt a fan of the texture  i also am not a fan of spicy so this was my least favorite of the 3  dungeness crab in naked sauce  this is their house special sauce which is a combo of all the sauces mixed together  to me  it was a tad on the lemon salty side  the crab though was very tender and meaty  my favorite of the seafood  all in all  it was pretty good but it can become rather salty towards the end  i would go again 
amongst an influx of cajun boil type restaurants in the nyc area  the naked crab does it a lil different but right  we started off with their grilled oysters  grilled corn with cheese  their bone marrow  garlic noodles  and lobster roll  each dish was excellently executed  hot  flavorful  and delicious  we opted for the clam boil  mildly spiced with plenty of butter and garlic  the boil included the usual  corn and potatoes and a twist with their inclusion of rice cakes which are chewy  tasty and an enjoyable addition to the boil bags  the drinks are well made  not too strong and come inside the coolest  zip lock drink style bags  the crowds will be coming soon to this place  they're doing just about everything right 
a curiously scandalous name    and  perhaps  a bit inaccurate   let's think about this for a second; are crabs' shells what one could call clothing?  because if that's the case  then the crabs here aren't naked (they come with the shells on)   but  if a shelled crab is considered "naked" for purposes to suit the namesake of this establishment  then i suppose it wouldn't be inaccurate    but if a shelled crab can't be considered a clothed (or non naked) crab  then does it make sense that all shelled creatures are naked even with their shells?well  that took longer than it rightfully should have    anyway  this place does serve crab   hell  crab is the linchpin that brings notoriety to this place; and by crab  i mean crab that's served in the fashion of being in big plastic bags filled with crab parts  corn  sausage  shrimp  and potatoes    all things being doused in a buttery spicy lemony salty sauce concoction of your choice   as far as these cajun boil bags are concerned  the ones found here don't command the premium pricing that one would find in the city    and that's just fine with me  this stuff gets the job done just as effectively (and hell  maybe even a bit better) in addition to the signature bagged seafood selections (which also include shrimp  squid  crawfish  and other things i'm not naming because i don't know remember)  they have a number of other foodstuffs that you can order and eat like a civilized human being (i e  with a spoon and fork)   the noteworthy item that my party had undertaken the task of eating was the uni pasta   it was neatly presented in a bowl (in stark juxtaposition to the lack of elegance seen with the seafood bags)  and yes  we did eat the pasta with forks    as we're not savages 
the restaurant has a nice atmosphere  the staff there were efficient and pleasant  we were able to book a table for a big group without any problems  the music was a little loud so we couldn't hear what someone said down the table but a little screaming never hurt anyone  the food was good  we ordered everything off the appetizer menu  nothing bad  the crab roll  was eh the least favorite dish  the crab and shrimp boil naked and cajun was good  there is parking on the sidewalk in front of the store   only several spots  otherwise park at the mall  it gets really congested there 
great food and they have happy hour!! everything was yum and so filling  definitely coming back for the clams and lobster 
came here for happy hour only  $1 oysters are always an attractive deal to me  however  we got a mix of mostly fresh oysters  and some that were not fresh at all  those left a bad taste in our mouths  i would be careful with seasons when ordering $1 oysters here  the $1 wings are a pretty good deal  and good to munch on while sipping on beer  they put their cocktails in capri sun like pouches which make them fun to drink! all of their pouch cocktails are worth trying  but all of them taste very strongly of alcohol so beware if you do not like the strong tasting cocktails 
i don't know yet if i'm a fan   may update this review when i go again   i'm always worried happy hour (even on weekend!)  oysters aren't fresh   but this isn't the case with naked crab   we ordered 2 dozen of the blue point oysters and every single one tasted like sea and plump too!  if my review was based on this alone  i'd give it 4 stars the service was excellent though so i'd give 4 stars on that the entrees was where i had to take off a few points uni pasta   by far one of the best if not the best uni pasta i've had in nyc   they top it off with what the waiter called "crab eggs" but it's really crab tomalley   the price of $28 is pretty steep for a small (yet filling and decadent) plate of pasta   foie gras   this was very disappointing actually   there was just too much salt   would stay away from this dungeness crab  king crab legs  crawfish boil      they're good but nothing too special for the price   their "shabang" sauce was too vinegary for our palette   the garlic and butter sauce had an off brown orange color and there's something else in there    but can't quite figure out what it is i don't mind paying $$$ for great food   but this isn't great   i'll try it again some time in the near future though   would order something different   but will maybe do 3 4 dozen of the happy hour oysters  )
don't know that i can speak to their cajun bonafides  but otherwise  based on a fairly minimal one pick up order database i'd be largely inclined towards an enthusiastic thumbs up superbly supremely fresh mostly raw seafood was what i hoped for  and indeed received had never before tried  raw lobster  but their lobster sashimi was a glorious revelation of just how good this can be not thst the mussels w crudo of shrimp + avocado salad were inferior by any means not to mention a very tasty coconut pudding dessert 
loved it  some of the freshest oysters i've had in queens but the bone marrow was the best!!its definitely worth a trip 
fourth time here today  the owner is nothing but entertainment! the happy hour is awesome! $1 for oysters (fresh and juicy) and $6 for cocktails (we ordered 10) i haven't had a chance to try meat yet since i love seafood too much to resist  had 3+ bags of seafood mix every time i visit  dessert is super yummy and reasonable price 
i've been here about 4 times now and i love it here  first of all   atmospherebeing in flushing it's very hard to find a good place to eat with friends without it being packed or nosy  however this place is perfect  my friends and i can spend hours just hanging out here eating oysters and clams  second of all   food food is mostly hit or miss from what i experienced  mostly hit tho  everything seafood is delicious  burgers and pasta are good too (pastas portion not the biggest tho)  their plain mac and cheese was a thumbs down for me tho  go to would definitely be (happy hour) baked or raw oysters clams and their boil  their garlic noodles are really delicious too  i mainly come for these options so if you love seafood this is definitely the place for you  third   service service has always been good  gives you your space but still attentive  we had a big party today and they gave us shots on the house! i think price wise  not during happy hour it can rack up to be quite pricey but during it's a great value  tldr  10 10 i hope this place never shuts down lol
this restaurant isn't too hard to miss  it's literally right next to the hotel and a great spot for a lunch or dinner outing after shopping in the skyview center  everything from the fresh oysters to the grilled oysters to the lobster roll to the boil were scrumptious  the staff were very quick  attentive and awesome simply put  the prices are very reasonable and they also have an amazing happy hour from 4 7 daily  i'm definitely coming back 
i came here on a sunday afternoon with my friends  when we got there  i was thrilled with the service of the people who worked there  they were very kind and welcomed us  we tried plenty of foods when we were there  i personally love seafood  so everything here was great to me  they had lobster burgers  soft shell crabs  and pastas too! i also tried their seafood boil  and i loved their signature sauce  the portions were very fair too  in my opinion  their drinks are so fun to drink! though the thai iced tea was a bit sweet  the light bulbs in them made the drink and experience much more fun! i would definitely go back  and would highly recommend this place to you!
all!!!!i can say ill be backthe food was goodthe drinks was fab especially the drink callkalesshi from the game of thronesdon't know if i spelled it right  but love the place
i love these types of seafood places  the food was great  service was beyond amazing  waiters are super nice  i'll be coming back again!
ehhh  over hyped  the boil was great  lobster roll was super small  fries were delicious  cajun wings delicious  adult caprison should have been filled to the top & woulda been great to take with you   too bad you can't (i don't see why not) & steak over priced  won't be back ‍ our server jaikia was nice 
highly recommended!!!the best seafood i have ever tried in flushing!snow crab legs are the best 
if happy hour had a fan club  i'd be enrolled  let me tell you something    i love a good happy hour; and this happy hour right here is to die for  the grilled oyster(best i've ever had) and the drinks(can't remember what it's called  but it's the first drink on the menu)    amazing! the wings and brussel sprouts could've been better but were still very very good  i'd go back  gladly  i'm hoping to try other things on the menu soon    but for now  i'm impressed 
went here 1 22 18  love the music  beverage of choice  a khaleesi (excellent!!!)  had a seafood boil with shrimp  crab legs  mussels  corn  sausage rice cakes  complained about mussels (very sandy)  had them removed from the bill with no problem  along with apology from chef  the rest of food was really good  parking is scarce  i'd go back but would never order the mussels again
i will be returning to naked crab for happy hours  i ordered the $1 happy oysters  cajun fries  shrimp cocktail  2 $7 cocktails  and snow crab combo  it totaled into $98 (with tip)  the $1 oysters  $7 capri sun cocktails  and fries were the only thing i was satisfied with  the oysters were extremely fresh and no sand!!! the cocktails were so yummy! the fries were crispy and would be hard for someone to mess up fries  now  the bad  the shrimp cocktail was $12 for 5 shrimps  they were small to be shrimp cocktails  it is just too expensive for little quantity & size  the snow crab should have been the best thing we tasted since it is kind of the selling point of this place  but no  we got garlic butter but it did not taste like it  i've tried other places like this and garlic butter is usually always good and buttery  this place just had chunks of garlic in the sauce and it was just okay      not good  also  the combo comes with 1 2 pound of clam  shrimp or crawfish  we thought it was a good deal but      we realized we got fooled  let me explain  the combo was $31  the snow crab itself would be $24 lb & clams $12 13 lb  they make you think you're getting a deal when you're not because it doesn't come with 1 pound of clam!!! only 1 2 pound!!! and they do not state how much is clams you would be getting on the menu  i only found out because i asked  over all  i will be returning for only happy hour for the oysters & cocktails  i am willing to try other things on the menus but i will not be getting any of the boils (seafood bags) or the shrimp cocktail again  thanks for reading my long ass review!! hope it helped!!
absolutely fantastic! i was pleasantly surprised with naked crab and its offerings  the food was delicious and the service was top notch  they have great happy hour specials from 3pm 11pm and all night if you sit at the bar  you can't go wrong with $1 raw oysters   $1 50 grilled oysters and a variety of drink specials! we were a party of 3 and we started with a few drinks  a dozen oysters  the uni pasta  3 lbs of seafood boil to share and the creme brulee & green tea truffle dessert  every single dish offered quality ingredients   the oysters were super fresh  the uni pasta was creamy  yet light and the seafood was beyond flavorful! the creme brulee was probably one of the best i've had (not overly sweet & super creamy)! we were all swept away by the quality of their food and are already making plans for our next visit! it's a true gem in the busy streets of flushing and i couldn't be happier to welcome the good eats and great service offered here shout out to nelson  the manager owner  who really knows the importance of quality customer service  he was friendly and attentive from the start of our naked crab experience and throughout! i can't wait to go back!ps   decor food service is on point here! you really don't feel like you're in flushing when dining here  way better than the boil! two thumbs up to the staff!
came here on a weekday for dinner and we were seated right away  the atmosphere in this restaurant makes you forget that you are in the middle of flushing  i had my eye on the uni pasta but they didn't have uni the day i went  so we settled for the bone marrow pasta that they recommended  we also ordered the crab cake for appetizer  1lb of crawfish in cajun sauce medium spice  and 1lb of shrimp in the butter garlic sauce mild  (if you are up for a challenge there is a option for carolina reaper)  crab cake had a poached egg on top but tasted like the frozen crab cakes  the bone marrow pasta was nothing exciting and definitely not worth the price! however  the boils was delicious their sauces were so flavorful! the seafood in the boils were also very fresh 
great place! the seafood was fresh  service prompt!  and waiters were very nice  i had the garlic bread  fried calamari  shrimp balls  and the snow crab and shrimp combo boil! me and my bf left satisfied and full!  update! 2nd time here and it was just as delish! not only that but the owner was soo nice and charged my phone! calamarie was amazing! corn was great! everything about naked crab is amazing!!
my boyfriend and i came to naked crab during a slight snow storm so there weren't a lot of people and we were seated right away  we ordered the shrimp in naked sauce (medium) and snow crab in naked sauce (mild)  naked sauce is a combination of the three sauces  cajun  garlic butter  and lemon pepper  i would recommend getting medium instead of mild for more flavor  the food came out in a timely manner and my oh my  it was delicious! my boyfriend wore a thick sweater and his sleeves kept rolling down  so one of the waiters came by and rolled it up for him   haha! i would definitely come here again  the food was great  the service was 10 out of 10  and it's very affordable 
food was good  we made mistake of ordering spicy though  crying  inside  took the rest home to clean off spicy and eat   first time here  lesson learned 
2nd time coming to this place and its still just as delicious! hubby and i love the crab legs!! my cousin had the soft shell crab burger which she said was delicious!  i def love that they play r&b hiphop too!! sooo coming back for more!
ate at the bar for all night hh  the bars have hooks for your things so it's not so inconvenient!the service is fast and friendly  the place was pretty empty on a wednesday night  but no complaints we tried the garlic noodles  oysters  mac & cheese  chicken wings  grilled clams  and cajun fries  the garlic noodles are definitely better than claw daddy's in the city  they're kind of sweet garlicky  you can't go wrong with oysters (they give lemon & cocktail sauce)  but some of them got a little gritty  chicken wings were a little saltier than i prefer  but were super crispy  the garlic butter sauce on the grilled clams was great  you can't go wrong with fries either and we had so many choices of wine to pick from  two types of white  two types of red  and a sparkling  if i'm remembering correctly we stayed for like 3 hours or something  but no one seemed to mind  it's a little out of the way for the main st  area  but definitely one of the best hh deals around  not just in flushing  will definitely go back!
one of my friends recommended this spot  i gotta say the seafood here was extremely fresh i and my friend had the snow crab combo with shrimps with the oyster sampler  the oysters are good and shrimps were delicious the crabs were not flavorful  it is not worthy for the price 
the foods are good  but!! they are too expensive toward the small amount?? these oysters are not $1 each but $2 5 each  i never saw any oysters like this small  and the beef marrow is so little marrow like nothing   for $10  lol if you are not a big fan please avoid  the pasta is the only thing i could recommend  feeling bad for taking my family here    ((
this restaurant hasn't been opened for too long and there's definitely a lot of potential  for an establishment that hasn't been around for too long  they honestly deserve more credit and attention  it's located in the building where the parc hotel is  which is right next to skyview  the restaurant is super easy to miss  but you can park there easily once you find it! it's the gray building on college point boulevard  first off  the service here is amazing and the food here is just as stellar  there's barely any cajun seafood places in queens and the ones that have been in flushing in the past were complete trash  the raw oysters were realllllllly good! we ordered a dozen oysters and they were all shucked nicely and they were super meaty and flavorful  the grilled oysters and clam were terrific too  like the ones from the raw bar  they were just as meaty as well (a little on the tougher side since they're cooked  but with the butter and everything  it tasted delicious!)i loved the fried chicken  it was super crunchy and crispy  there was a super generous and even batter to meat ratio! cajun fries were crispy and super fresh when we got them! the uni pasta is a little on the pricey side and uni is an acquired taste for a lot of people  i feel like the uni pasta can use a little work since it wasn't as creamy as i have tried in other places  but it was still yummy and the uni complemented the pasta very well when you mix it in  the smoked salmon salad was good  but i wished there was a little more salmon  the salmons were nice and smoky though! really enjoyed it ^___^! the shrimp and avocado salad was great too actually! not really sure what sauce they drizzled over the salad but it complemented the shrimp and avocado chunks really well  the salads were also very refreshing for a meal like this we also got the sirloin prime  duck breast and lamb rack  the duck breast was cooked to perfection! it had a melt in your mouth sensation that left you wanting for more after each bite ^__^ the salad on the side also complemented it really well and was very refreshing  the sirloin prime was cut in very big chunks  so that got a little overwhelming  we ordered it medium rare  but it was still very enjoyable (had to cut it up into thinner slices though)  usually not a big fan of lamb  so i wasn't gonna eat it at first  but ended up eating and very grateful that i did  the lamb rack was very tender and flavorful as well  thoroughly enjoyed all three entrees  for the boils  they're a little smaller than the ones in the city  but the ones in the city are way more expensive too  we had a bit of the shrimps  mussels  clams  snow crabs  lobster  king crab legs  the mussels and clams were actually a lot more meaty than what i'm used to seeing so i was really happy to see that  the shrimp was good  wasn't overcooked or anything (but i feel like shrimp never really gets the flavor of the sauce as well since you have to peel the skin anyway)  lobster was good too  but my favorite was definitely the snow crabs and king crab legs  they're pretty generous with the amount of snow crabs and they're all super meaty  they provide you with bibs  gloves and cracking utensils  you also get the corns  shrimp and potatoes and those usually go with the sauces really well  i believe we had the naked sauce  which is their own restaurant made sauce  and the sha bang sauce in medium! i'm usually not a spicy fan  but i was able to handle it  for dessert  get the creme brulee! they serve it in these mason jars which are pretty cute and the creme brulee itself is a nice finish to such a meal! i guess some people have given this place lower reviews because of the pricing of the food  but good cajun seafood is really hard to come by in queens  also seems like they have pretty good happy hour deals from 5pm 7pm and all night at the bar  so no need to travel to the city for these happy hour deals!!
the naked crab is not the best seafood restaurant but it's definitely one of the better places to go for lobster and crab legs there was alot of hype when this restaurant opened but it's definitely not over rated will do a second visit when we're in the flushing area and in the mood for crabs 
this is a new restaurant and i came across it completely random walking out of the mall  been here with a couple friends twice for happy hour $1 oysters  they have great happy hour deals  drinks are great and food is amazing  their regular entree is a little pricey but their appetizer menu has a lot to offer! the black truffle pasta is absolutely a must as well as their lobster mac and cheese  you won't want it to be over  don't mind the presentation of the menu    (it's like a filing folder) but it definitely does not reflect the great food and service at this place!
my first time to try this place  happy hour everyday of the week! fresh  plump  juicy oysters and the sky view drink came in a pouch that lights up! will definitely be back and bring family and friends over 
great sea food and drinks  seafood always fresh and price is right  oysters fresh and they have happy hour every day  i keep coming back with my husband  we love this place!
the rate is for service here's what happened  i saw a promotion online and i have the coupon for this restaurant and i asked them if i could use it  the waitress said no first and then she said she could ask (with my phone)  when she returned  she said i could use it  then someone called her and she came back again saying that the minimum amount for using it would be $50  later i realized the coupon did not even say about the minimum  so obviously  they didn't want to give us the deal  so cheap! besides that  the food was okay 
the owner is really funny and the environment is great! the food is awesome as well! taste so much better than the boil in my opinion  they offer great deals for happy hour 
nice food  order crab middle hot sauce and  cocktail  and just steam lobster   they are good 
i literally just walked out from dinner spending $91 on some watered down tasting seafood (granted i also ordered 2 apps and 2 beers)  and i also happened to drain a crab claw for a good minute because there was so much water in it that ultimately watered down everything!!only reason why this review is getting 2 stars is because of the excellent service (restaurant was half empty during friday dinner service)  i guess for the price  you get what you get  after dining at the boil in chinatown and the boiling crab in los angeles this can never compare  we ordered 2 combos of the 1 pound snow crab and shrimp (5 7 pieces of large shrimps) for $28 which came with 2 pieces of corn and potatoes  it is definitely cheaper than the more well known spots but of course the shrimp and crab here were previously frozen  when it came time to peeling the crab  half the meat would rip off with the skin  and the sauce? you're only allowed one sauce per each combo because they put the 2 seafoods together (so it hides the fact that there are barely any shrimps)  we ordered a cajun spicy and a naked spicy  boy was it watered down  the spiciness was definitely there but there was none of that garlic lemon taste the servers said there would be  as for the 2 apps  we tried the mac and cheese and cajun fries  the mac and cheese come shortly after we ordered and was served on a skillet  it was okay  the cajun fries that i ordered came after our boil came out and it was just your everyday seasoned fries  once i saw how plain it was i thought they forgot the cajun seasoning so i asked our server if cajun spice was suppose to be sprinkled on but she said "no the fries are marinated"  don't come  don't eat here  i rather fly to la for boil than  eat here ever again 
came to see what naked crabs look like  was bot disappointed at all  finding parking may be hard  but the atmosphere was nice  it was like a sports bar  i came when there weren't a lot of people but i still enjoyed it here with my girlfriend  waitresses were friendly and gave suggestions as well  the refreshments like most places were overpriced  the pineapple juice was $3 and it tasted like it came out from the can  we had mac and cheese as our appetizer and it was really good  it was like on the salty side but the cheese taste stood out and it tasted really good  for our main course we got snow crabs w  shrimp and extra sausage  it came with one potato and corn  we picked medium spicy with garlic and butter w  cajun sauce  this was really good too! the outside was a bit salty but it was rich in flavor in the meat  the quantity was good too  we were satisfied when we finished the whole meal 
i heard about this place for about 2 months now and finally decided to try it  i ordered the uni pasta  one pound of shrimp in the naked crab sauce  the oyster sampler  and the fish and chips appetizer  we decided to try the uni pasta because of the many pictures we saw on yelp   however the uni pasta ($28) was the biggest disappointment i've had here  the sauce was so heavy and dry that it ruined the creamy goodness that's supposed to come from the uni   we each took a bite and didn't finish the rest the oyster sampler ($13) however was pretty fresh and well priced  something i would come back for  the pound of shrimp($14) in the naked sauce was good but the sauce was very watery  if only it was thicker  the fish and chips ($9) appetizer was good but very small portion   
best food i had in new york  europe crayfish  and japanese a5 beef are the best  must try
sometimes when you have a crab craving there is nothing you can do or think about until you have some decent crab  i had no interest for imitation  i wanted to have lush buttery melt in your mouth crab meat  and naked crab delivered with filled crab legs  butter and fun drinks (see packaging)  they were friendly and accommodating and my only regret is they don't have a location closer to me 
so many new dishes on the menu! yum  we had yohan as the server and he was outstanding as always  please thank him for us  he was so attentive and friendly!
had a small family dinner there and let me say i was impressed! the snow crab legs were so meaty the calamari was amazing! i had the 1lb snow crab legs boil bag in cajun sauce medium uhhh to die for! the light up drinks were everything! i def will be going back! it was surprisingly quiet for a friday night    the dj was great! i really enjoyed myself 
with a influx of cajun boils flooding this gentrified town we call flushing  it's the new craze these days  with competition minutes away from each other  everyone is doing their best to stand out  and naked crab is doing just that  standing out  the rustic modern feel is warm with a southern comfort atmosphere of people just enjoying themselves  that it makes you just want to have a good time as well the food is what you'd expect  nothing short of good  i must admit though  i'm not a fan of the sauces for the boils  but the quality of food and service is great  i'd say this is one of the best happy hour $1 oysters you can find  the wings are decent and the grilled oysters were good just a little small  the hero though  is that uni pasta  it's a pricey dish  but well worthy of it's praise  the pasta is nicely al dente with a nice portion of uni on top of umami bursting tomalley aka crab fat  if you don't mind the cholesterol  it's a heavenly addition with the plump pieces of uni  overall  great food and great service  but it comes with a price  it's a new establishment that i can see lasting in this ever growing competition filled little town  stay fat mother suckers
the store food are welcome  for kids and adults  waiters are nice  we smell curry flavour that's  our favourite curry seafood  oyster fresh and dipping sauce are good    all the hall and restroom are clean and looks romanticized  price is ok  my kid liked to eat friend fried  my mom liked to eat pasta 
first time eating here  my dad knows the owner so we were able to get a taste of mainly everything on the menu which was awesome  this is an unbiased review we had raw oysters  baked oysters and clams (like the ones you can find in nola)  seafood mardi gra boils  goose liver  lamb  garlic bread  steak  and dessert i've been to nola this past september so the flavor profile of this place really brought me back to that trip  i'm a huge seafood boil kinda gal and this place made me extremely happy all in all  naked crab gets a 10 10 definitely will be coming back again 
if you've been to the boil in chinatown  then you clearly know which place is the better contender  my friends and i came here since one of them had a coupon to get 1lb of shrimp for free  of course  we go anywhere that offers some kind of free food  we ordered some cocktails  cajun fries  mac and cheese with lobster  2lbs of clams  1lb of shrimp (free)  both with the naked sauce and medium spice  and some oysters since it was happy hour  i got the sky view cocktail which had lychee and vodka  i thought it was pretty good and my friends enjoyed their drinks as well (first kiss and in the nude)  i have no say on the oysters since i'm not a big fan of them but my friends that had them said it was fresh and good  in my opinion  the stars of the dinner were the cajun fries and the lobster mac and cheese  why? because i felt like the shrimp and clams were subpar  for 3 people  the shrimp and clams were more than enough  they both came with a couple of potatoes and corn which was a plus  however  the naked sauce was a disappointment  i expected something more garlicky and buttery  similar to the boil's special sauce  but it came nowhere close to it  although there's a hint of garlic  i did wish it was stronger especially since we saw huge pieces of garlic in the bags  though we all left pretty full  the boils itself were kind of a letdown  however  this place is a nice addition to the vast amount of restaurants in flushing  the redeeming factors of the dinner were the fries  mac and cheese  the music ambiance  and the service we've received  it's hard to find good service in flushing so props to naked crab for delivering  most likely won't be back anytime soon though 
customer service is great   they are very friendly  when i was cold the boss even turned down the heat  now that's what i call customer service  the shrimp is out of this world fresh and the sauce it comes in (house sauce) is the bees kneez  way better than boil!fresh fish  good chefs  good people  good service  good sauce  decent atmosphere  what more could you ask for?
love it! we went today (sunday) for lunch  i had the white wine sangria and it was amazing!! look at my photos  self explanatory  we did the naked sauce with our lobster and prawns  we did the lemon pepper sauce with our mussels  both at a medium spicy level  we love kumamotos and bluepoints sooooo you can best believe i ordered extras!!! great service  great food  i can't wait to go back again 
this is one of my new favorite places! i had a blast here my first time and my second time around was still pretty enjoyable first thing's first  happy hour is from 3 7pm  past 7pm  head up to the bar for the hh deals  which is still not too shabby  here's what you get for the hh   $6 cocktails (usually $8)  $5 beers (usually $5 $9)  $1 oysters   $1 wings  $1 50 grilled oystersi loved the $1 oysters  the $1 wings not so much  i just remember the meat of the wings being so red and although they look crunchy  they were pretty bland  the dollar oysters were so fresh  though! they don't give out the garlic sauce  though  just the cocktail sauce and the drinks are pretty good   pretty strong  so you're getting your money's worth snow crab combo  always a hit   1 lb  snow crab with your choice of shrimp  clams  or crawfish  and i always get the shrimp  so this dish is great  but my personal peeve is that when taking the shell of the shrimp   the last tip of the tail doesn't come off   so to me it's not as fresh as i'd like it to be  but again  that's just my preference  the snow crab is still delicious  though!lobster roll  personal opinion   unless i am drowning in lobster  i don't see a need for the $20 price  i did not drown in lobster  however  it comes with a ton of arugula salad and fries   doesn't equate the price tag  but it's trying shrimp & avocado salad  honestly  this was pretty enjoyable  i wish the shrimp wasn't cut down into so many pieces  but at one point  there was definitely more avocado than lettuce  so no complaints  here!garlic bread  pretty good  if this already doesn't come with the dish that i am eating  i usually order it on the side uni pasta  fish lovers who love pasta  this is for you! i didn't expect to like it as much as i did   i am not a fan of uni  but it was pleasantly enjoyable wild salmon  woot  this one was a hit! it was cooked so well  i'm  still salivating over it   oh! i've also had the naked crab mardi gras special  while they do say that it's a minimum of 4 people   when my group ordered it  they still asked how many people would be eating it  so we ended up ordering for two  it was still pretty filling  you get   snow crab legs  squid  mussles  clams  shrimps  corn  potatoes  sausage  garlic breadwe ordered all of this with the naked sauce and we didn't like the sauce   which is what the seafood was all drowned in  but i'm not holding it against this  i'd probably order this again with any other sauce so i'm not sure for everyone else  but the only thing that bummed me out about my experiences was that because we were sitting right under the air conditioner  so if we didn't eat our food then and there  it got cold within 5 minutes  so yes  the mardi gras special got cold real quick as everyone has mentioned  though  the service is awesome  so that's another reason why i'll stay loyal  oh and the restrooms are so clean! there are 3 gender neutral restrooms so everyone wins and fyi for any cider lovers  the only cider they have is rekorderlig wild berries cider cailin's recommendations  snow crab combo ($24)  garlic bread ($5)  wild salmon ($24)  shrimp & avocado salad ($8)  uni pasta ($28)  $1 oysters!
happy hour was delicious and very much worth it! the oysters were fresh and the grilled clams were great  the 1lb garlic butter clams were half off  but were a little too salty for our taste  the menu is very straight forward and has a lot of different options  however we went for mostly sea food and were not disappointed  service was also very good! we had a wonderful experience here and are definitely planning on coming back 
came for hh  $1 oysters were fresh  we ordered 2 dozen in total and a dozen of $1 5 grilled oysters  when we got there at 5pm on a sunday  it was very empty with maybe 1 or 2 tables filled  we ordered the lobster combo boil  with the naked sauce + medium spicy  it was not medium spicy as i was able to eat a lot of it (and i am the least spice tolerant person anyone knows)  we had the uni pasta  which was surprisingly good  wasn't too busy until around 6 or 7  i think their hh menu is robust and good quality 
the best crab and shrimp combo    i've ever tasted ! i mean it's easy to overspend here because everything looks good   i came here last night craving seafood with my love   and ordered the bake sea clams and for my entree the snow crab with shrimp ( garlic butter flavored)     my taste buds were in heaven ! not to mention the service was phenomenal   very attentive   really nice waiters ! highly recommend!
although it's a seafood restaurant but i always get the shrimp avocado salad and foie gras   it's delicious 
my favorite spot for seafood boil! not over crowded  kid friendly  great menu  great drinks  had to minus one star for no parking available  best option is to park at sky view mall's lot  2 blocks away   there's a good variety of dishes offered on the menu and just as delish as the boil  which is great for those that aren't down to get dirty (grilled oysters are a must)  the food is overall well prepared and fresh (they clean out the shrimp shit!!) definitely coming back and highly recommend!!
food r always amazing  highly recommended!  the lamb chop; steak (30oz); foie gras (v good  i order this every visit); carb  and the kobe beef (risotto lay on bottom) always delicious! nelson always arranged the food nicely 
went here earlier this month with my bestie as i was already around flushing for a dental appointment  been wanting to check out this place since i heard about it from my wechat feed  we came after happy hours was over (5 7pm) so missed out on the happy hour deals as we were seat on the table instead of the bar  at the bar it's all day happy hour deals  so do take advantage of that  in my tips  i mention what the happy hour deals were  check it out  we had the boils  i had the lobster boil while my bestie had the snow crab boil  when you first add them on your wechat acct if you have wechat which i recommend  it's my favorite chat social media platform  most popular in china as it was develop there  anyways  after you add their acct on your wechat friends and post up three photos on your wechat feed  they will give you one pound of shrimp free  so worth it! checking into yelp will get you a free glass of wine  worth it  now back to the boil  it was well season sauce and delicious  this is definitely a place for seafood lovers  if you want crayfish they are out for the season  but there is a seafood place in 8th avenue that offer crayfish boil  very good place for crayfish called "beef and fish"   but if you are craving boils and don't feel like going all the way to queens  then check out "boat house" in 8th ave brooklyn   back to naked crab  the staff was professional and friendly  service was acceptable  would come back again for the happy hour specials  i noticed they have a competitor restaurant call "shaking crab" down the block that also offer boils in flushing  i will check out that place next and let you know my review 
i've never been to any of these seafood boil places so i was really excited to try one  the naked crab was a pretty good choice in my opinion  the staff was friendly and attentive and the place was dim but not too dark  i tried their garlic pasta  which honestly just tasted like pasta with garlic sauce  now  that being said it was still delicious  maybe just not worth the price  which i think was about $7  the corn with butter was $3  and i thought the sauces on the corn made it good but the corn itself was a little mediocre  the clams were really good in my opinion  but just a little small  and the boil i got was the snow crab legs with shrimp  so i usually really like spicy food so i got mine with the naked sauce with is a combo of the garlic  cajun and lemon pepper and then plus the spicy flavor  i think that was a mistake on my part because the spice overpowered the seafood taste a little which i think wasn't necessary  if you like spice  getting the medium or mild is probably enough  the boil itself came with 6 crab legs  8 shrimps  a piece of corn and half a potato  i actually really liked the potato in it  which helped with the spice lol overall  i really enjoyed my visit there  even though the pricing might not be totally worth it but i guess you're also paying for the experience  especially if you have never been!
went here recently & although the restaurant is just about identical to "claw daddy's" the food is slightly better  we had the grilled oysters  chicken wings & fried oysters (you haven't lived until you had fried oysters ) for our appetizers  as our entree my friend had the shrimp boil & i had shrimp crawfish which was really good  the drinks were really good as well & 100% better than claw daddy's 
we were originally going to shaking crab but good thign we didnt! we saw naked crab on yelp and decided to switch last minute  we made it just in time for dinner but early enough for the hh specials! lucky us!   hh even on weekends until 7pm! the hh although is limited  is enough   $5 beer and wine  and $1 raw oysters  $1 50 grilled oysters  $1 per wing   we ordered a little bit of everything  don't expect anything premium here  but it fills the crave for some raw cooked oysters  the seating was spacious and it wasn't too crowded the entire time we dined here  the servers did get busy and it was hard to flag one down but the meal was great  we ordered a lb of the shabang sauce which had a weird kick of sriracha in the beginning but ur palette adjusts and you start to like it quite a bit  their garlic butter sauce can use a bit of work but nonetheless  satisfies the craving for some seafood  little did we know  they have a few  and by a few i mean 2 3 spots in the front of the restaurant for parking  there's only one ramp so you may have to roll up on the curb  their men is quite extensive and i ordered a side of white rice   expecting nice asian jasmine rice and what i got instead was some cheap american rice    either that or it was extremely low quality rice  i was disappointed because i always eat the rice with the sauce in the seafood bags  my friend ordered a lobster roll   and found a nice piece of human hair tucked into the roll   needless to say she didn't eat it and they took it off the bill  i was also disappointed they didn't have gumbo  but still had a great meal 
i've been here twice  very clean restaurant and good service both times  first time i tried the uni pasta and a pound of shrimp in their homemade sauce  the second time  i tried the garlic butter noodles  lobster roll  and another pound of shrimp in garlic butter sauce  i would say that everything was above satisfactory except for the lobster roll  the bun they use feels very ordinary   almost like a regular hot dog bun  the lobster bits are made into a cole slaw like mixture  which doesn't give it the typical lobster roll flavor  the uni pasta is $28 which is very expensive for what you get  but the presentation is a1  they often have groupons available for use  i'm looking forward to returning for their happy hour!
my family and i were in the mood for seafood and we happened upon this place  the hostess and the waitresses were very friendly aside from the one waiter who seemed rather annoyed  they had the music blaring like it was a night club scene so when we had to constantly repeat our orders  he was visibly annoyed  the lobster combo ($40) was lacking in terms of quantity while the flavor was decent; half an ear of corn and half a potato with a small lobster was certainly not worth the money  we never even received the salmon dish since they ended up sending it to another table  one time for this place is enough  not worth the money or the time  you're practically yelling to everyone since they refused to turn the music down  there's no wait because this place isn't even worth the time to walk to it  there are plenty of other places in flushing that have good seafood at a good price and you can actually have a private conversation  please don't even give this place a second thought 
this place is a hidden gem  the food is amazing  the boil sauces are wonderful and at a reasonable price  my favorite dish is the truffle pasta  baked clams and the truffle oil lamb chops  definitely a must try  oh the coconut pudding is amazing too  i highly recommend this place 
i saw a good deal for this spot on groupon  i'm not sure if the deal is still available but go check it out  i recommend a few dishes here wild salmon  did not have the fishy taste which was great  the chef cooked it to near perfectiongarlic noodles  worth trying cajun corn  too much white sauce for me but the flavor combo was a worthy trycreme brule  super good  must try dessert  the original flavor is yum!thai iced tea  flavor was on point  ask for more milk if you like it milkyi somewhat recommend the beef sliders  too much coleslaw  if you like coleslaw then you would like this burger  the beef patty taste was alright nothing to rave about 
came in on saturday at 7 30pm with a serious cajun boil craving  if you're driving  theres about 5 parking spots right in front of the restaurant  instant pros  1  no wait to be seated 2  happy hour every day raw oysters ($1)   grilled clams and oysters ($1 50)we started with the raw oysters and clams which tasted very fresh  the clams were huge! 4 5  next we had a few grilled oysters and clams which were a mouthful of hot salty cheesy goodness 4 5  the garlic noodles were like spaghetti noodles with a sweet sauce and salty cheese on top   it was alright  3 5  now for the main event  for the 2 of us   we decided on 1 lb crawfish ($14 lb) in cajun sauce  1 lb crawfish in naked sauce and 1 lb king crab legs ($38 lb) in naked sauce  each bag came with a piece of corn and a potato  i think it must be crawfish season because these crawfish were big and meaty  the king crab was cooked perfectly and retained its ocean sweetness  the cajun sauce had a sweetness to it and reminded me of japanese curry  the naked sauce  which is a mix of cajun   lemon butter   and garlic butter was a little better   but personally still not enough garlic  overall taste experience 4 5  and this mostly because i can't help but compare the taste to the boil which has the sauce that's jam packed with garlic   the bartender was very friendly  the service was excellent   the boil has a special place in my heart and stomach  but the naked crab is a contender when i can't wait 50 min to get to chinatown  i would definitely come back 
first time eating there  took our 9yr old for her bday dinner  we had the seafood boils with lobster  snow crab legs and shrimp  the garlic butter sauce is delicious  my husband and i really like the cocktails the was serve in ziplock bags with light up ices  definitely try the sky view it's amazing  we would definitely come back again and try the other items in the menu  also the service was friendly and efficient 
i've been to many seafood places in the city and in flushing  never had anything really stand out but no complaints  that said  naked crab is great! came here twice so far and both times the service was great  the prices are reasonable (1 lb of snow crab + shrimp for $24 includes corn and potatoes) and even greater if you get the groupon! the waitresses will check up on you often and refill your water often as well  the seafood is really fresh and you can taste it  when i crack open a crack leg  there's a satisfying whole piece of meat instead of having it broken in half  got my food to go cus i couldn't finish it all  when i got home and wanted to eat it  i saw that they included a pair of plastic gloves to eat it with  so thoughtful and sweet!would def come here again  )!
came here for the happy hour and left happy  highly recommend the grilled oysters clams 
i've been to boiling crab on the west coast many times so i'm always looking for something similar here in ny  this place came up and i decided to give it a try  servers were very friendly and always available when needed  they have happy hour from 3 7 which is always a plus in my book  oysters are $1 each which was pretty fresh  we ended up ordering more  grilled oyster i think it's $1 50 each was also pretty good but i prefer raw  we then ordered 1lb of cajun shrimp  1lb of sheabang shrimp  1 butter garlic sauce lobster  2 lbs of the naked sauce snow crab  portions were huge well worth it! the sauces not so much a fan it was very thick and it tasted ok  also ordered foie gras amazing! and creme brulee heaven!  i would definitely come back here and just order steamed without any sauce 
my girlfriend and i found a groupon for the naked crab ($15 for $30 worth) so we decided to give it a try  we made reservations for a saturday at 6pm 3 4 days in advance  little did we know  there was a blizzard on that day that made traveling by car very difficult and dangerous  being the adventurous couple that we are  some might say "stupid"  we decided to still go  they have a "parking lot" that could hold up to 4 cars max right in front of their restaurant  so being the lucky guy that i am  i was able to snag myself a spot right next to the only car there  we were greeted right when we walked in and we even got to choose where we sat because there was a grand total of 2 other groups of customers  the service was awesome because all the attention was focused on us  basically  our water and tea cups were constantly being refilled  mostly my girlfriend's because she seems to always be suffering from dehydration or something  the highlight of my visit though was when i was having trouble rolling up my sleeves because i had sauce all over my gloves  the waiter came over and offered to roll up my sleeves  what a guy  right? i made sure to leave a generous tip for this fellow  the restaurant started filling up a little towards the end of our dinner  so that just shows we're not the only adventurous people willing to sacrifice our safety for some seafood 
stop in naked crab let me tell you this place is very good the service and food was excellent too bad i live in ca   next time i am in town will come back for the mushroom risotto kobe beef that was my favorite  there was a bunch of other good food but this kobe beef was the one that stood out the most
have a wonderful experience at naked crab  love the food and special the lobster sandwich   affordable price for happy hours   will come back again 
the uni pasta is well cooked and delicious; crawfish is a bit on the small side but the spices are superb   overall a good place to go 
dined in with familyenvironment was very night club feel with good vibesfood raw   raw was absolutely amazing over tons of ice and is very fresh  broil   the seasoning is amazing which makes the broil  spices might be spicy for otherssliders steak   believe it over not the steak was the most random thing on the menu but the presentation and how they cook it 10 10sliders came in three varies a must tryoverall a great place to pregame or hang out with friends*great cocktails
definitely isn't my first choice for seafood but it's local and their seasoning is delicious    drinks are good (could be stronger)  they come in a cute pouch with a light up ice cube  my only disappointment was my crab legs had little to no meat inside
i order the lobster roll and it was okay  was expecting it to be phenomenal but it wasn't    the fries and salad was good   doubt i'll go back
this place is awesome  their kumamoto oysters are so fresh  their boils are delicious  i live a couple of blocks away from here  this is going to be my go to spot for seafood  i'm super happy i found this gem in the heart of flushing!
seafood are fresh  staffs are friendly  the only downside is the sauce is little too spicy when we ordered mild  it's more like moderate spicy than mild when we received the food  overall  would recommend this place for decent seafood 
great place! loved the decor  the people and drinks  the appetizer garlic noodles wasn't what we expected! they used over cooked spaghetti noodles  it was alright  won't order again  we also ordered the calamari which came with a sweet sauce  again won't order again  we ordered the special for $35 person   included potatoes  corn  blue crab  sausage  mussels  clams and shrimps  we ordered for two and it was enough for four  the cajun sauce with garlic was good but we chose medium hot and it was too hot for some of us  we also ordered a king crab boil with the same sauce but hot  it was way too hot so next time i'll get medium! loved that they gave each of us gloves which helped us to keep our hands clean and not smelling like seafood  the mixed drink choices were interesting  we will definitely stoping in again
my favorite seafood restaurant the fried calamari with the mango chili sauce it comes with is to die for  and i love the lobster roll the drinks are delicious the hunger games drink "khaleesi" is my fav
purchased a coupon for this place and ordered a bunch of appetizers to share  service was fantastic  interior had a fun vibe but the food could have been better   calamari  was rubbery  dipping sauce was good but i wish they gave more   lobster mac and cheese  was a bit watery and bland   fish and chips  the fish they used had a very strong fishy flavor  not sure if it was fresh or if it was just the type of fish used but it wasn't very good  the tarter sauce that was included for dipping was salty  the fries were perfect if i go back i'll try their signature boils next time but definitely avoiding the appetizers 
truly amazing place in flushing! didn't have much expectations before i went as i thought it was another gimmick restaurant  glad it proved me wrong!  we were a party of 10 and went on a sunday night  the restaurant is not packed but did fill about 80% of the tables  we were seated in the middle of the restaurant and still feel pretty comfortable and not too noisy  the food is tasty! the duck confit salad  baked clams oysters  black truffle pasta and the bags of various seafood  oh almost forgot the crawfish   i can't  handle spicy food too well and the restaurant was able to tone down on the spicy and made it perfect for me  the desserts are amazing! the coconut pudding is excellent and the green tea tiramisu is perfect  but more importantly  the staffs there made the experience even better  the host nelson is a very nice guy  he's very accommodating with my toddler special request (very kids friendly place)  made honest recommendations for food  overall cleanliness is so good that is rare to see in flushing  other waiters were very attentive to our needs and always made sure we have clean plates to use and took away our emptied shells  decor is just right and made us very comfortably seated and enjoyed our food  i definitely will go back again   even if it means i need to deal with the crazy flushing traffic!
doesn't get better and fresher than this  i was craving cajun food the other day and didn't find anything local  my boyfriend had found this place through a yelp search and thought why not try it  it's not southern food  but that cajun seasoning on my awesome snow crab boil was insane! took me back to new orleans the atmosphere is pretty calm; i like the set up  all the tools you need for the crab are already on the table  they have their specials written on the wall  the oysters are great  so many choices!i have no complaints at all with this place  i've been three times in the past month  must get back soon!
love love love this spot  although the boil will always have my heart  naked crab has become my go to seafood spot  i've been here more than four times since its opening and have no regrets they have a great selection of sauces to choose from for their boils  and my personal favorite is the shebang sauce  medium spicy  their shrimps are always fresh from my experience  so just go with that if you're not sure what to order for your first time also  do yourself a favor and take advantage of their happy hour specials (applies for any time of the day if you're sitting at the bar)  oysters are $1 and their cocktails ($6) are delicious! if you're into fruity cocktails like me  i recommend the first love or red wedding  you won't regret it oh  and i couldn't end the review without mentioning how friendly the owner is  if you've been to naked crab  you probably know who i'm talking about because he's always super attentive and welcoming to the customers 
my friend did her birthday there and our bill came out to $500  the price is cheap for a sea food place but the only downside is the taste   it doesn't taste good  the soft shell crab burger is tasteless and the calamari tasted bread crumbs only  need more seasoning 
the best seafood in queens   has amazing inventive style drinks     knowledgeable staff      perfectly cooked food def a go to place for seafood and def a place i will be back to many times more
we went at happy hour time on a saturday  yes they have happy hour on saturdays too! the cocktails all tasted good with a good amount of alcohol   i ordered skyview and sweet temptation both very good  we had clams  oysters  crabs  garlic bread  uni pasta  shrimp avacado salad all was good except for shrimp avacado salad was a bit small and very little shrimp and avacado  music was good as if i'm listening to my own playlist in my car lol 
the naked crab wasn't as bad as i expected  i came in here with low expectations due to all the previous reviews but i had a decent dinner  i enjoyed the happy hour mainly because of the drinks  i didn't order the raw oyster but i did get the wings  grilled clam and grilled oyster  tbh i didn't really like it    the sauce and garlic on top was an okay flavor but boyyyyy was it fishy  i did enjoy the fried chicken wings  i've never had anything like it  super crunchy  the cajun fries were also pretty good  we ordered mac n cheese  which looked like it came from a kraft box   the boil was pretty good  a lot of crab legs were in it but i would suggest putting some veggies and potatoes  the scissors on the table and the roll of paper towel were super helpful 
disappointed valentine's day dinner  hubby made rsvp to the restaurant after looking at the good reviews  restaurant was half full by the time we got there and was seated right away  we settled in and got our drinks quickly  but we had to flag down the waitress to order  after sitting and starving for 25 minutes  we tried to flag down the waitress and asked where our food is  she said "oh! we are very busy today  your food should be coming out soon " ok  so then we got the calamari followed by the grilled corn  uni pasta  and snow crab & shrimp boil in medium spicy naked sauce  calamari was on point! the best part of the meal  the breading was crispy and not oily  and the squid was tender  the sauce dip was a sweet mango mixture but the serving was so sparse   even the second we asked for grilled corn   meh  i've had better  it's got a good amount of mayo  cheese  but maybe lacking in salt?uni pasta   only ordered this because my hubby wanted to try fresh uni and the glowing reviews of the pasta from yelp users  the pasta was great  and the uni very fresh  it also came with a green paste on top that kind of turned me away  but my hubby said it was ok the boil   i have to say that i was disappointed with the boil  i've had some back in las vegas and it was the bomb  this place did not live up to that first taste  we had the medium spicy naked sauce  but it was really spicy with a jalapeno type spice  i was expecting more of a galic y spice  it came with potatoes and corn   which was not mentioned in the menu and thus the reason why we ordered the grilled corn and we were left with so much corn after this soda   beware  the soda is like a 6oz glass bottle size for $3  not worth it then getting the check  omg  we just wanted to run already   there was only about 2 3 waitresses serving the now packed restaurant   about 80 people  i flagged down the hostess and told her we have a groupon and want the check  she said we can't use it  i told her we told the waitress before said to do it at the end  the hostess said  "oh" and left and never came back  we flagged down another lady   probably a server   who told us to wait for our waitress  we finally flagged down our waitress and it took another 10 minutes to settle our bill  the table next to us got their food (and they ordered a ton of food) and was out way before us!!!! the owner manager   whoever wrote about how great he is    never saw him  i am disappointed in the lack of servers on a holiday will i go back? i'll never say never  but i don't think i will crave this joint anytime soon oh  and there is a couple of parking spots out in front of the restaurant  call ahead and ask if there are spots  otherwise  you can pay to park at skyview mall across the street 
first time here and it was a beautiful experience  i went with a $30 off groupon last sunday accompanied by a friend and didn't know what to expect  our server jasmine helped us with the drink choices and food as well  she kept checking on us to make sure we were comfortable  we had the cajun wings and fries for appetizers  for the entree  i had the lobster and clam combo (cajun spicy) and my friend had 2 orders of king crab legs and a lb of shrimp  both orders came with 1 4 corn on the cob and a potato  i love the cajun spice used for the combos  it wasn't too spicy or too salty  it was just right for my taste buds and i would definitely return again with or without a groupon 
was seated at a table right away  waitress was friendly and polite  when it came to the food  it's wasn't what i expected  mussels tasted as if they just caught it  had the gritty taste of sand  the crabs didn't have any flavor  only thing that actually tasted great was the chicken wings! even their drinks  
i really enjoyed the food here   until i found a golf ball sized spider in the crawfish boil  the owners were extremely apologetic and even comped our entire meal  they were very professional and assured us they would educate their staff to be more careful when cleaning the crawfish  this was a birthday lunch for me from my mom so they even brought out a complimentary creme brulee (which was delicious) with a giant flaming candle  onto the food  everything was amazing  we ordered the happy hour $1 raw oysters  grilled oysters  and wings  we also got the uni pasta  2lbs of snow crab  and 1lb of crawfish  that uni pasta though  oh em gee  i've been dreaming about it ever since  it was perfectly al dente with large  fresh pieces of uni  and topped off with this crab egg heaven  droooool! the crawfish was surprisingly fresh too  not overcooked and super juicy  unfortunately  i only ate 3 before the spidey  the crab legs were a good meaty size too  we weren't really crazy about the sauces  but i'm not a big fan of cajun seasoning  and everything is smothered in it for the boils no matter which sauce you choose  it's premade so you can't request it without  the atmosphere is modern and fun  i'll definitely be back for that uni pasta!
this place is good like american style table and bar stuff and was ok but not thats fresh as i though i order lobster doesnt taste so great for me like they use dead lobster but service is great keep going
came here for an event  the fare was mainly fried things   calamari  fries  shrimp balls  fish  etc  there was also salad and some base drinks like oj  overall  i liked the feel of the place   the wood is a nice touch   and the decor is interesting  the food was pretty tasty as well  my favourite being the shrimp balls with cheddar 
latest in cajun style seafood in queens   the combos are a good deal with alaskan crab  shrimp with head on  potatoes and corn inclined   lemon pepper and garlic butter sauces and the spicy level  could be varied garlic bread was good  the brussels sprouts were tasty with the fatty bacon  offered non seafood items like sliders  chicken wings and burger   this is helpful for any non seafood lovers in the group   casual booths and tables  also bar with flat screens  and loud music  drafty whenever someone enters from the main door 
it was just ok   good service  not good food   $8 for a 1 2 glass of red wine  poured in a white wine glass   my wine drinkers know what i'm saying   wouldn't go back   the boil is where i'm at!
amazing experience! i came here with a friend at 4pm right when they opened on a monday  i love the interior of the restaurant; very spacious and inviting  there is also a nice bar in the restaurant  i didn't catch the bartenders name  but she was so so so nice and helpful  we sat at the bar because we wanted to take advantage of the $1 wings and $6 drinks  for the drinks  we got the red wedding and the red sangria  the food was amazing  and super fresh  for the appetizers  we ordered (and will recommend) the mac and cheese with lobster ($6 extra) and the calamari (the sauce it came with was a sweet and sour sauce and it pairs perfectly) we then ordered the pound of shrimp and crabs with the naked sauce which was recommended to us (a blend of all the sauces together) we definitely enjoyed the shrimp and the crabs  they were delish and plus we love seafood! it also came with a big piece of potato and a little piece of corn  (you can also order extra) this place is comparable to the boil  but the customer service was so on point that i recommend this place to everyone!
i loved this place  i came two nights in a row for happy hour  who doesn't love dollar blue point oysters  the service was great and the menu was even better  i had the mac & cheese which was amazing    along with the romanesco cauliflower  the next night i had the crab boil  it was very good just missing some crusty bread to get all that good sauce!
a flushing gem  as we entered with a party of five on a wednesday night  the environment was warm and the waiters and waitresses were very welcoming  we got fresh oysters and clams  fish and chips  and fried calamari to start  and the snow crab combo with shrimp covered in the "naked special sauce " the naked sauce is a must! it basically consisted of cajun  garlic butter  and lemon pepper and it was to die for! the oysters were extremely fresh and the fish & chips were crispy and melts in your mouth  considering this place is similar to the boil in chinatown  it's convenient to open one like it in flushing  i would definitely recommend this place to friends and family  however  this place is currently cash only just like a lot of places in flushing but there's a chase atm down the block  so come prepared!
service is always on point  especially ask for phyllis  super sweet girl  the bartender dora makes the best drinks  you can ask for extra strong and she can still make it taste so good it just creeps up 
tasty spicy delicious  staff is great very attentive and friendly
decent seafood place among the likes of boiling crab  o crab  the boil  etc  even though we ordered two boils  the best dish (by far) was surprisingly the duck salad  consisting of arugula with light dressing  and several slices of really tender  flavorful duck  it was a hard dish to follow  but even so the boils were much more underwhelming  we got the dungeness crab with crayfish and the lobster with clams with medium spice  and it was nice but nothing crazy good 
came here with my family  everything we wanted to try apparently was sold out the day before  they have the happy hour menu on the wall   only to find nothing was available  we ended up just ordering boil seafood  the cajun sauce was just way too salty  the pepper lemon was spicy   the only good one was pretty gaelic butter sauce    i also ordered the strawberry mint lemonade and that was big disappointment  do not order it  it was the worse drink i had tried in my life  i had about 2 sips and left the whole drink there  it gave me a huge headache afterwards  at the end of the night  my husband and i ended up in the bathroom   don't think we will ever come back  i would suggest going to claw daddy's in the city  the food is way better 
came to eat here with a friend on afternoon  the restaurant had a nice atmosphere  there was one one other occupied table when we sat down to eat  we ordered the cajun boils and they were not tasty  the sauce just kind of sits out side of the seafood  leaving the seafood tasteless  the sauce mix needs some adjustments! you can see the oil and sauce separating  it does not have an appetizing appeal  the waiter failed to tell us our groupon can't be used if we ordered anything off the happy hour menu  so i just had my groupon expire because i do not plan on eating here again  for oyster lovers  they do have $1 oysters during happy hour!
dirty practises  dirty management and dirty food  they have a mandatory 18% tip charge which is an oxymoron  the management obviously is pocketing the cash and not reporting the taxes but most importantly  the sand in the food was extreme tonight  was good place before  lost it's touch  they just don't care anymore 
second time here enjoying happy hour  cocktails  fried calamari  $1 bluepoint oysters  grill oysters and clams   everything so good  the environment   music it all makes it comfortable  parking is the only problem 
made a reservation for 5 people without a problem  appetizers are okay and service is friendly  however  they ran out of snow crab legs!!! how does a seafood place that specializes in boil type seafood run out of snow crab?!?! had to go with the king crab instead   wasn't very good and much more expensive  might give it another try since they have uni pasta that i'm intrigued by  but seriously disappointing first time 
overall the seafood is fresh but pricy  avoid all kinds of  sashimi  we had a lobster sashimi and an abalone sashimi  both are in a small portion  i can finish the abalone with just one bite  the cajun seafood is much better  the price is reasonable  the service is also very good  next time  i will only order the cajun seafood 
the ambience is a cool  fun chill vibe  the prices are very reasonable  i ordered a snow crab boil   which i was apprehensive about because snow crab legs are usually very lackluster  however i was pleasantly surprised with how satisfied i was with my choice  i had more than enough crab legs in the bag (i barely finished them)  the cocktails were every good as well  and the wait staff was professional as well 
fresh seafood and great service! definitely a place to visit if you want some seafood!!
great selection of food even if you aren't planning to eat seafood  you can get down and dirty with the gloves and bibs to crack open your crab legs or peel your shrimp or you can have a nice dainty meal of pasta or steak  it was cool to see a mix of both in the same restaurant  6 of us girls ordered 9lbs of seafood broil in total  we had 3lbs of snow crab legs  3lbs of shrimp  2 lbs of clams  and 1 lb of mussels  we did try the cajun sauce and the lemon pepper but the two didn't taste really different  the medium spicy isn't spicy at all so if you go higher if you'd like  the seafood was great overall and i'l be bringing friends parents back! the only thing that annoyed us a bit was the music that was a bit too loud  with a full house and so many people talking  it was already hard to hear each other and the music didn't help 
best boil in queens  the koleesi drink was very nice  on the sweet side but light and fruity  i had the grilled clam appetizer and the lobster and shrimp boil in medium naked sauce  the medium was just hot enough to make your nose run so if you like a little spice don't go any further then this  the clams were a  it salty i believe it was the cheese on top but they were still very tasty  the naked sauce was very tasty and not too oily  the seafood taste fresh not frozen  it's also very conveniently located ext to a lot of transportation
the food and drinks were absolutely the best  i would definitely recommend this place 
this place is really good one of my favorite places to eat pasta amazing! i will visit again next time i'm in the flushing  
i came for the oyster happy hour though i eventually got suckered in to try a few things  the raw oysters were pretty good but lacked variety  some were shucked a bit poorly and had a lot of shell and grit which was unpleasant  the grilled oysters i did not like as much and were also more expensive  the garlic they used wasn't cooked enough so there was a heavy flavor with a hint of sourness  the uni pasta was far better than i anticipated with a robust richness and well cooked pasta  the boil however i thought was weak  the flavors did not steep into the seafood and it was almost bland  i would not recommend this 
love this place!great  service   tasty drinks  this restaurant  not only have boils but aslo they have very good entrees 。like rack of lamb  steak  squik ink pasta  and grilled  lobster  with cheese  on it  all taste delicious  for the boil garlic  butter and shabang are my favorite  flavors  cant wait to try more stuff!
came here the first time cause of all the positive reviews  the grill oysters for happy hr was really good  but that's about it  my bf and i got 2 lbs shrimp and 1 lb snow crab with the naked sauce  the naked sauce in my opinion isn't as good the boil sauce  if the sauces were rated on the scale of 1 10; the boil being 10 then naked crab is 3 the snow crab was unusually tough  i've been to similar locations and none of them were like this  something was definitely wrong with the snow crab  i will not be back 
second time weve been here  first time was actually a good visit  im reviewing for the second one  walked in with my girlfriend  theres very few people in the restaurant for late dinner  took us about 5 10 mins to order upon sitting down due to deciding if i should get crawfish on the snow crab combo or shrimp  thought id try to crawfish  also ordered a pound of shrimp and a side of cajun fries and rice bowl   placed our order now the waiting game begins  a big group of people came in and a couple of guests on different parties  a couple sat down at the bar as well and some guests on tables have left  we were served cajun fries  the only reason i gave the review one extra star  eventually while eating and finishing the fries while waiting for our seafood  we notice most of the tables that have sat down after us are getting their orders one by one including the big party  clearly our order was de prioritized  we waited on   its been 35 minutes  i told my girlfirend i wanted to leave but she said give it 5 more minutes  luckily(or not) the food came 3 minutes later  ive almost lost my appetite but might as well since we were there  we ordered cajun mild on both the shrimp and the snow crab combo  shrimp sauce was ok  shrimp seemed overcooked where its shells were hard to separate from the meat  on the snowcrab combo  the sauce had a good cajun kick to it but very salty let alone the crabmeat itself was salty as well  we also ordered a rice bowl and this was either last night rice or someone dont know how to cook rice because it was very hard and dry  not the even a mediocre dinner unfortunately since we had a good first visit and mostly ruined by the almost 40 minute wait  i doubt ill be back in this location since hot n juicy crawfish is opening up soon around the neighborhood 
very similar to the boil in chinatown  convenient for people in flushing to go too  i ordered raw oysters which was a little small for blue point  wings was pretty good  uni pasta  and a seafood platter cajun flavor which both were good
we chose this restaurant to be our company thanksgiving party place  we arrived at around 6 40pm and we ordered like 3 runs raw grilled oysters  clams  chicken wings for happy hour price  which is really cheap and food tastes good as well  especially the grilled oyster  we also ordered lobster combo with shrimps and corns on the side  i chose naked crab sauce i think other sauce will be better  their mushroom cream soup is soso  recommend to sit at the bar so you can enjoy the happy hour all night!
a group of guys went here on a saturday afternoon for some fresh raw oysters as well as other samplings   we got there and it was happy hour so the blue points were $1 each!   we also got the grilled clams and individual entrees the food was fresh  the entree sizes were a bit on the small size  but none of the guys complained   i had the lobster roll and was pleasantly surprised it wasn't made with mayo!  it was fresh and tasty!i found a new spot close to my church whenever i am in need of oysters!
i had the cajun fries  snow crab and shrimp with the naked sauce which is anything but naked  its a combination of the garlic butter  lemon pepper and something else  it was a little over whelming for seafood  next time i'll stick to something simpler  the snow crab was very good and sweet  the shrimp was ok but pretty big in size  each seafood bag comes with corn and potato  they do have happy hour special and available even on holidays  so glad i was able to try it 
place is welcoming and industrial in design  my party ordered brussels sprouts  snow crab legs mac and cheese with lobster and clams  i didn't like the clams much too fishy for my taste but my friend loved them  i loved everything else  we both had shabang sauce in our crab leg shrimp combo which consist of lemon butter cilantro and siracha  now we a full content and no longer hangry!
not too bad for a place in flushing   the happy hour specials were worth the price   the baked clams were really good  if you check in with yelp you get wine   we ordered some of the boil stuff   the shrimp is good   the clams was not worth it because the shell is adding mostly to the weight   uni pasta and garlic pasta is just ok   overall experience is not bad   things are pretty good 
ordered food from here off of ubereats  after discovering they sold lobster rolls  we prolonged our hunger and waited until they opened  ordered a lobster roll  shrimp and avocado salad  cajun wings and cajun fries  it took a nice amount of time to come but the order was correct when it finally arrived  everything was delicious  although the lobster roll was quite small and i was happy i had ordered a salad as well so i wouldn't be hungry afterwards  i think for $17 the lobster roll could be a tad bit bigger and come with a few more fries 
happy hour is totally worth it  the oysters were fresh and the grilled oysters and clams were great  the chicken wings were crispy and were fried in a nice batter  also had the uni pasta which was ok  a little overpriced considering the area and didn't come out hot but not bad  didn't try the boil but people who had it seemed to enjoy it  will try that next time 
never coming back again  i had a really bad stomachache that very same night after dinner and i started vomiting  well oh well  turns out i had food poisoning  i knew i had to stop eating after i ate a few pieces of oysters and it wasn't fresh  maybe it was the oysters or shrimp  who knows but i am never coming back again 
biggest waste of time and money  it was pretty priced up for the quality of the food  i would have no problem paying for it if i had enjoyed my meal but this was one of the worst attempt at southern food i have ever seen  the seafood while seems fresh  still had a stanky sea water smell to it  absolutely disgusting  the squid ink pasta     horrible  the coveted boiled seafood was decent but nothing to write home about  if you want better food  go to the boil after leaving  believe it or not  we went to another place to get more food  this was entirely because the quality of the food was so subpar that we did not want to order more food  closing remarks avoid if possible 
it is really so so! we were there for the happy hours  we (2 adult and 1 kid) ordered a dozen raw oysters  2 dozen grilled oysters   chicken wings and 2 cocktails  the raw oyster is so small! i am a petit  usually a dozen raw oyster will make me full  but not at here! the grilled oysters for my husband are also very small! the chicken wings is nothing special! and the cocktails are like juice! we spent around 100 dollars there  but nobody is full or feel satisfied      we have to go to another restaurant        so don't recommend this place!
this perfect resturant to have dinner with friends and family very differens with other s 
i am eating now  can't wait to give a review  it is an amazing seafood restaurants  they put food in the bag  you can use your hand to catch what you want  i have been search such restaurant for a long time  finally  i find if they have more selections  i will definitely come here every week 
definitely going back in the future   parked at sky view mall parking  then walk through the mall  i went close to closing time on a weekday  so it wasn't very busy   the waiting staff were nice and attentive  loved the mac and cheese with lobster   must walk up for their happy hour one day 
tasty food but way overpriced for small portions  the waiter was excellent and i liked the atmosphere  we ordered the lobsters & shrimp combo boil with garlic butter sauce and added a pound of snow crab   excellent sauce with  great flavor   also had the squid ink pasta which was ok nothing special   the grilled oysters were very tasty as our appetizer  i walked out still hungry for what i paid   i might go back for the happy hour specials  
an absolutely great experience and service! not only that but the food is beyond amazing! chicken wings were perfect along with the calamaris and to top it off the seafood boils were perfect!!! the seasoning was finger licking good!i will definitely be back and recommend naked crab to anyone looking for a different experience to dine make sure you order their cocktails! especially their "in the nude" cocktail  dora does an amazing job making them 
after a failed attempt to enjoy festivities at the long island oyster festival  my family and i yelped this location and decided to check it out  we came on saturday around 3pm for a party of six  we stayed for about 3 hours and there was only one other table the entire time   3 dozen raw oysters for happy hours ($1 each)   fresh  great price and quality  would definitely order this again  don't forget to ask for horseradish if you're into it   1 dozen grilled oysters for happy hours ($1 50 each)   great price  nothing compared to new orleans  but i would definitely order this again  it is great if you like butter  garlic and parmesan cheese   6 fried cajun chicken wings for happy hour ($1 each)   decent price and size though i did not really taste the cajun  liked the batter though   1 uni pasta ($28)   loved it  wouldn't really order it again for that price but worth the try   2 foie gras ($20)   delicious  would order this again   2 lbs seafood boil (shrimp & clams)   seasoning was on point  wouldn't normally order this in a restaurant though but if you're into this its definitely worth the try!  1 branzino ($24)   great crisp on the skin  a little expensive for the protion imo  1 avocado shrimp salad ($8)   the apple vinaigrette was delicious!  i'd order this again because of it    creme brulee   cute presentation  haven't seen creme brulee presented that way before  probably because the burnt surface area (which is the best part) is less than the total custard  good flavor though service was great  but again we were 1 out of 2 tables for about 3 hours   i'm surprised to see a place like this in flushing  though the parking is rough  i'd definitely return since the boil is a little inconvenient to get to  if you're looking to save your wallet i do not recommend this place  if you're used to city prices and can't make it out to the boil this is a great place to go to  don't forget to bring cash (10% off) 
great food and great service! like the lamb chop and coconut pudding  came in with 7 people and the owner nelson kept us entertained all the time 
this place has a great happy hour so get there early to enjoy it   i particular like drink  "in the nude" it was delicious   the appetizers were so good you almost don't need to order entrees   i said almost!  jasmine our waitress was awesome   great to talk to and crack jokes with   i would definitely go back 
the place is soso  the food is not that good  we ordered cajun wings; but they gave us all drumsticks  i don't know if they did that intentionally because we use a groupon voucher? the table next to us got the wings  also the drumsticks are over fried; hard like a rock  very very disappointing experience  will not return again!!!
ambiance  good music  very relaxed environment  the tables are clean and the decor is cute service  10 10  attentive staff  the wait was not long at all i had two drinks  the sky blue cocktail and a lime mojito  the sky blue cocktail was really good  it tastes just like a lychee drink with a hint of vodka  i had the oysters  clams  avocado shrimp salad  duck liver  crab legs  squid  etc  all of the seafood was fresh and tasty  the sauces provided were also flavorful  everything was filling  the meat was crispy and tender as well  overall it was a great experience  my stomach was very happy  ^)
this place is nice and the food was not bad  their garlic noodle is good  their garlic bread is also good  however their butter and garlic sauce in the combos don't really taste like butter and garlic  their cocktails are ok  the raw tower is very fresh!
food and staff were great!! will definitely come back for more    in fact  maybe today! lol  also  this place reminds me of claw daddy in the city  which is another great seafood restaurant!!
the lobster crab rolls and fried calamari cajun wings i recommend  great service and we also received complimentary oysters!pricier than the average menu  but you get what you pay for  they also have a full bar with flatscreen tvs  great decor as well  check it out!
we were seated right away on a friday night  the place is good for groups  what was supposed to be a date night turned into a family dinner outing  the general seating area can be a little loud  but the ambience was nice and welcoming  the food  fried calamari  grilled corn  fresh clams  and cajun wings  not a big fan of fried foods but clams were a big hit  the sauce that came with the calamari was delish  grilled corn was mexican style with the butter and cheese  we had 2   entree  uni pasta  for those who like uni  i hear this is your go to  we had a few uni lovers and the loved the pasta  boils  my boyfriend and i shared a boil combo together of mild cajun seasoning  it still had a kick to it  some ordered the garlic butter mild with their combo and thought it was still a bit spicy  each boil comes with a corn and half a potato in the seasoning  dessert  green tea tiramisu  cafe creme brûlée and i think it was strawberry shortcake not a big fan of matcha powder sprinkled on my cake but it did have a strong green tea flavor  creme brûlée was rich and the strawberry shortcake was everyone's favorite because of the small bits in the flavorful strawberry ice cream  nelson was polite and entertaining during our visit and we look forward to going again for some good seafood boils 
i despise establishments that have their friends post fake 5 star reviews to lure people in and i'm suspecting all these 5 star reviews are not all that genuine  good restaurants are supposed to catch attention through real word of mouth  the food is supposed to do most of the talking! within the asian community  if a restaurant is good the crowd will automatically follow  because in asian culture food is king and if its good we will line up for it in hordes  as a matter of fact  asians (predominantly chinese folks) will line up just for the sake of lining up if they see a line; this is even before they know what the hell they are lining up for  unfortunately of all my friends who tried naked crab none have recommended this place when it was brought up    however even with a lack of praise from my friends i still decided to give them a try  i am all about trying new spots in the neighborhood and i wholeheartedly want such businesses to succeed  especially when its something fresh and new  within the past couple of years several restaurants have given the whole creole seafood thing a stab and have failed miserably  this is mainly because the owners of these joints want to open shop based solely on how successful such restaurants have proven be however they have no fucking clue on how to make the food  the restaurant looked the part and it seems like a pretty penny was used for the construction  a rather large restaurant for flushing  built to support a lot of diners at once but on my visit they only had 3 4 tables on a saturday night  we were actually a bit perplexed why the place was nearly empty during its 2nd week of opening well this was until the food came  of all the things we had that night  the best tasting were the cajun wings and the garlic bread  their cajun house sauce was flavorless and soulless    just tasted like peppered salty water mixed in old bay  moreover they didn't have a few things on the menu with one being crawfish  fail! for the cajun boil we ordered the snow crab combo which consisted of snow crab  clams  shrimp and king crab which we added since they didn't have crawfish   the seafood was very low grade  the king crab legs were tiny  mushy and super salty  the snow crabs were also very salty while the shrimp and clams were overcooked and rubbery  the potato and the corn did not absorb any of the flavors of the boil either  most of the ingredients put into the boil were previously frozen and the flavor profiles of broth did not mask the "previously frozen" taste very well  the spices used seemed very low grade and tinny  think large format cafeteria grade spices  seems like they spent all the money into building the restaurant but sloppily slapped the menu together and hired any random chef to make the food  the servers were very attentive and polite  i felt their enthusiasm and hopeful energy  towards the end of dinner we were even offered a free round of drinks on the house which was a very nice gesture  they also have happy hour for drinks  dollars wings and oysters which is cool  unfortunately as i previously mentioned i got the impression that the owners are simply trying to cash in on the southern craw fish craze that started in louisiana then migrated to cali while having no clue how it's made  in cali i've had some of the best damn crawfish in my life from a spot called boiling crab  currently the only half decent offering of this creole style seafood can be found at the boil in manhattan  based on our experience  naked crab fell so short i wouldn't recommend it  this is why the folks down south who have been making these boils for years guard their recipes for dear life  such recipes as they are passed down from generation to generation as family secrets  naked crab like so many others got this all wrong  restaurants of this type succeed because the people who made such food have been doing so for their family and friends for years and most likely had their friends and family encourage them to open shop  after my visit here i would really suggest that if they are to succeed  they really need to rethink the formulas and recipes of the boils  first impressions are key at any restaurant and this was a huge disappointment 
we found our new cajun seafood boil place! great happy hour specials (3 7pm or all day at the bar)  $6 cocktails  $5 beer and wine  $1 oysters and $1 50 grilled oysters  we ordered a dozen of the raw oysters and they were quite large  we also ordered the snow crab combo with the whole shebang sauce  delicious  and even at medium spicy it was not too hot  it came with two corns and potatoes  but we added sausage for $3  prices aren't terrible  though expect to spend at least $60 for two people  many other food options aside from seafood boil as well  shrimp salad  pastas  soup  fries  etc  we'll be coming back!
came here for sunday dinner  because a few friends had recommended the spot saying that there was a new spot with great seafood  i gotta say the seafood here is extremely fresh! we got the grilled clams (must try)  lamb chops (tender amazing)  raw clams oysters *(fresh)  chicken wings fries (crunchy)  and most importantly the seafood boil (must get)  for our seafood boil we tried the lobster shrimp crab all of which were good  but i would go with the shrimp crab for next time!i would proceed with caution if you're going to get anything with the medium spice! it has got a ton of kick to it!
great food and great customer service  the boil platters are amazing  the happy hour oysters  cajun wings and the best part was the broiled clams  they are simply amazing! we tried all the deserts and they were great  green tea crembrulee  regular crembrulee and tartufo  the ambiance was upbeat and happy  music was great! i would recommend to sea food lovers and anyone looking to enjoy some good food w great service 
food was awesome  seafood was so fresh it's sweet to the taste  definitely try the raw oysters and clams  followed by smoked salmon arugula salad  then the seafood broil  alaskan king crab legs  snow crab and shrimp  finally top off with the uni pasta   if you have a sweet tooth  try the homemade creme brulee  will be back soon 
the raw oyster and clams are very clean and fresh and the uni pasta was fantastic  but  i would stray away from the garlic and butter flavor boiled seafood that doesn't taste like garlic butter at all  the mussels had to be sent back because it wasn't fresh and the king snow crab legs had like four bites of meat inside  not worth $38 dollars  wouldn't be coming back 
came to try the new place out with a group of friends on sunday night  maybe we came on a off day because we don't know how the place has such rave reviews  we ordered brussel sprouts  shrimp avocado salad  mushroom soups and corn as appetizers  the soup was the best part  do not try the squid ink or uni pasta! stench was so bad it was inedible  none of it was fresh  the boil itself was okay  bill came out to $250 and we left the restaurant hungry  *btw  they charge for refills on soft drinks  we were charged $3 a cup for seltzer  place was definitely not worth the trip 
the food was amazing! the service was great   my so and i started with 2 orders of clams which were cohoag    they were very tender but too big for my liking! afterwards we had a shrimp and avocado salad which was phenomenal ! absolutely delicious! i had the rack of lamb that came with brussel sprouts  mushrooms and mashed potatoes !  my boyfriend could not keep his eyes off of my plate ! lamb was prepared perfectly (medium rare)  he had scallops that were accompanied by asparagus with mashed potatoes    although he isn't big on asparagus he says they were cooked perfectly and they were delicious i would definitely come here again  
they did a great job with the decor at this restaurant  however let's talk about the food  my girlfriend and i ordered oysters and drinks since it was happy hour  this was the highlight of the meal  oysters were meaty and fresh and the drinks were fine  we also ordered lobster  shrimp  crawfish  corn and potatoes for the boil  i have to say the boil was disappointing  it tasted like the ingredients were boiled in water and the tossed in the sauce  corn and potatoes are usually my favorite part of a boil however in this case they tasted bland  the flavors did not penetrate at all  i would definitely recommend naked crab for their hh but not the boil  tip for those using groupon  hh items do not apply 
this is a first time i went to this restaurant with my friends  the servers are so nice and the food is so great  i strongly recommend the squid ink pasta  grilled lobster with cheese and the boils for dungeness crab  i chose the naked sauce  also the cocktails i recommend red wedding  i really like this place 
the sauce and marinade was very lackluster  additionally  i paid 36 dollars for one small lobster and about six clams  the service was nonexsistant yet when it came to paying tips  they had the audacity to ask for more than what i thought was appropriate  the ambiance was not what i expected  overall  the amount of food i paid for was not up to par  i felt very disappointed and suggest that potential customers spend their money else where 
if i can give it no stars  i would   i'm completely shock with all the recent reviews giving it rave reviews   this place is by far the worse boil seafood restaurant i've eaten   let me break it down for you pro 1   ambiance2   the non seafood side items were more edible than the seafood (corn  cajun fries  etc)con 1  made reservation and when arrived i was told it's not reflected in their system   had to wait as if i just walked in   not a happy camper to start off 2   once seated  waited for someone to provide us menu and water   after a while  had to ask for them   you would think after having a bad start with a new customer  they would have comp an appetizer or a drink to show good faith in business   but that never happened 3   the grilled oyster is so bland 4   my king crab boil was served 20 minutes prior to my husband lobster roll   isn't it quicker to make lobster roll than the boil dish?5   the naked sauce is awful compare to the boil's sauce   it's watery and just taste awful6   the most annoying part  the seafood was not fresh at all   the crab was stuck onto the shell   the meat does not come off easily and it tasted like rubber band   for the same price as the other establishment  i would definitely prefer to go back to them   of all places i've gone between the boil  claw daddy's and cajun sea  this place is by far the worse establishment   we will never go back to this place   we were looking forward to going to this place as a date night  but it quickly turned south   we would rather make the extra commute into the city for better quality and tasty food   if you were to conduct a focus group between naked crab's food vs the other establishments  you will see the the final result study would support my reviews 
this place is amazing  great service  the owner was extremely generous  hooked me up with a free drink  would definitely come back 
i came here with my boyfriend  this restaurant is reasonable in size and definitely has potential  for some reason  big groups can't use more than one $30 off for two groupons  not sure why they can't just split the bills and use the groupons separately  my only complaints are the portions being too small  and the quality was average for the price we paid including tip and tax  spent about $80 for two here  3 stars for the good staff and happy hour specials 
they're obviously trying to copy paste "the boil" in manhattan  i tried the fried chicken wing and the lobster sashimi  terrible  $25 for like eight tiny pieces of lobster  and the the main course boil stuff i tried snow crab and shrimp  tbh the potato and the corn was good  but none of their sauce was good at all  i just can't understand why so many people give them five stars  not that pricy after all but just don't worth it  don't go 
first time here with my boyfriend  had mac&cheese for appetizer and ordered 1lb snow crabs with corn  potato and sausage with garlic herb seasoning  both tasted good & will deff come back again!
food was good！little expensive tho，so make sure to check groupon before you go，cuz sometimes they have great deal there！
my overall experience at naked crab was below mediocre  this restaurant has decor that make feel like i'm at a happy hour in soho  but    food is very overpriced and waiters served scanty portions   the lobster boil with a small stick of corn and clams and small lobster was about $40  so not worth it  a large shrimp i can find in a chinese supermarket down the block has more meat than the lobster in the boil  there were only about 3 clams (meatless)  in there with sad broth   appetizer stick of corn $3 and greasy brussels sprouts for $7  sad  uni pasta $28 was a small handful of cheap pasta with a tablespoon of uni  step up your game  turn down the volume of the radio station so we can actually fucking order and not get the wrong dish of eggs with scallops  rant over
com here with my girl friend on friday night between happy hour  but the happy hour be come a disaster hour      the reason i want to try this restaurant is because groupon   however  they won't let me use it on the happy hour  okay is fine not a big deal  your dishes are so little small for a big price even on the happy hour   the food tastes just so so but the portion is small  it doesn't worth the price you put on the menu  i'll never comeback again   i spent over hundred dollar for two people and walk out still hungry  i feel really disappoint 
i came here on a monday night after for thoroughly searching for a place in queens that had a late happy hour and served oysters  i found a gem! we ordered raw oysters  baked oysters and clams  cajun wings  and lobster roll  everything was great  we sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive  the drinks were good for a happy hour i must say  it also was not crowded at all which i enjoyed having enough space at the bar  i will definitely return 
the food and customer service was very good  jasmine was attentive to my table and was very helpful  i'll definitely be coming back again and will be bringing friends    the hulk
no frills  love the happy hour  i ordered 1 lb of snow crab legs and mac and cheese with lobster  it was so good  i would come back again  staff was friendly  food came on time  it wasn't a ridiculous wait like at the boil  i was stuffed and happy!
love this place to totally  nice music  great place to chill  boils are so good  we got that free 1 lb of shrimp for free  love the place  will come back again definitely 
this was my first exciting dinner experience with my friends  yesterday we tried new sauce named sha bang which is good  we want to eat again next weekend 
if you love eating with your hands  this place is for you   the sauces are all curry based so be warned   the baked clams and oysters are good as an appetizer  all the seafood is per pound when you order  so if you love seafood it could be quite expensive  they offer other items besides seafood  you can also have steak 
food was very good service was very good  nice atmosphere  lobster was cooked perfect  oysters were fresh and good and cold  i will recommend this restaurant to all my friends 
naked crab has amazing seafood and it's extremely fresh  the staff is very friendly  i would definitely recommend this place to anyone  and they play great music 
came here with my husband on a friday night after work not knowing what to expect i was pleasantly surprised by the experience  the service was very warm and attentive  even the chef who concocted the sauce for our seafood boil came out to greet us at the end of the meal! the seafood was very fresh  especially taking into consideration the location of this place (flushing  queens) where owning a restaurant is so competitive! i was reluctant to order the raw oysters (only $1 each during happy hour) because i had a bad experience with raw oysters before at another restaurant  but after trying them here  now i realize why people love raw oysters so much  they were fresh and clean (none of that fishy taste) and just slid down my throat    so good!at the waitresses' recommendation  we ordered the snow crab combo which came with snow crab legs  shrimp  potatoes and corn  again  very fresh seafood and those shrimp were huge! you get to choose from 4 different sauces and we chose the one with butter  garlic  cilantro  and siracha  it was really good )we also ordered cajun fries and cold mussels topped with chopped corn  onion  cliantro  and garlic  finally  at the owner's recommendation  we tried the uni pasta  oh man was it good! you could tell that they put a lot of uni into the sauce  which was sooooo creamy  one bite was never enough  i took one bite and kept going back for more!there were so many other things on the menu that i wanted to try  so i'm definitely coming back!!!!
found this jewel on yelp  the owner moved his car so we could park  all of the staff and sercice were great  food was awesome  and my 17 year old is a picky seafood eater   i would definitely recommend this restaurant 
came here to meet a group of friends and also had my toddler with me  my waitress was super helpful with making sure my kid was comfortable  i had the garlic noodles  amazing! had the snob crab boil with the 3 sauces mixture on the side and it was soooooo good  i had the grilled oysters which were delicious  tried a chicken wing  which was good but the little one stole it from me and ate it herself  drinks were potent and personally delivered to the table by the owner 
i love this restaurant   the food is excellent  with 5 different sauces you can choose from   and the service is great with a friendly atmosphere   
staff is great! food and drinks are worth the trip  good atmosphere to relax and talk 
saw this place on a whim  and decided to check it out  excellent! has a seafood southern style with asian influence  oysters were great (very fresh) and the crab cigars was a really cool take on an egg roll but filled with crab meat (delicious!)
super fresh seafood !! the uni pasta is a amazing!!! the foie gras is delicious!!! the raw oyster melts in your mouth   i give 10 stars to this place   definitely recommend this place to seafood lovers  i can't wait to go back and try the lamb and steak  the drinks was good as well 
very good food   the staff are friendly and it's nice to go here for lunch  cheap and cheerful but bad parking 
staying at the parc hotel  came in for appetizers and drinks  very good calamari and shrimp  avocado salad  very nice staff   very accommodating and personable  really enjoyed the atmosphere in this restaurant  would definitely come back to have dinner if we had the time!
the service was extremely bad  the waitress who served us was too impolite  i have so much complain to say but doesn't even bother to type a word for this restaurant 
first time here  we've ordered hh 1 1 2 dz raw oyster  hh grilled oyster  1 2 dz raw clams  bone marrow  lobster roll  foie gras and lobster combo  overall food is pretty good but the lobster  roll and lobster combo kinda dragged down the rating so i gave a 3star  raw oyster and clam are fresh so that's a plus but 3 out of a dozen you will happen to find cracked shells or sands in it(or maybe i am the lucky one)! grilled oyster and bone marrow tasty  foie gras $20 for the size of the foie gras is reasonable but too bland  the lobster roll pretty disappointed  the meat texture like frozen lobster meat bland as well and if i am paying $19 5 for it i am expecting at least decent meat not frozen! i've had lobster rolls at many place and i can say the lobster roll here is not acceptable  the lobster combo $35 we ordered garlic with butter  too much sauce and basically covered up all the seafood taste(also being said the lobster might not be fresh) lobster less than a lb and with just  7 8shrimp  1 potatoe 1 corn not sure if it's worth that price  the services is fairly good  will i return? most likely no 
service was great  and since it wasnt too busy  they offered the $35 person special for me and my mom  the special included almost everything  garlic bread  snow crab legs  shrimp  clam  mussels  sausage  corn and potato  the garlic butter and cajun sauce was not bad but maybe because they simply threw the food onto the wax paper on the table in front of us  it made it kind of cold in a short period of time   i was expecting it to be contained in those clear plastic bags that i saw other tables had but it was different in our case   overall  the food and service was not bad but i would prefer to go back to the boil instead 
took our nephew and his girlfriend here during their nyc visit as they wanted to try some east coast oysters  we ordered the sampler and it did not disappoint! the snow crab boil and the lobster boil were tasty too!  we ordered all the flavors but the lemon and pepper  medium spicy and less spicy  i prefer the medium spicy  we ordered the sliders and i loved the fried oyster one  i think i'll order some fried oysters the next time i'm there  the place was decorated so that it felt like we were by the docks and they were catching our meal nearby!
good food  big portions and great service!!! the music is poppin and the happy hour is the best!
excellent place   went today for the first time   and i have to say i was impressed with the quality of the food   took advantage of the "happy hour"  promo  from 3 pm to 7pm  and had a dozen oysters for a $1 each 6 grilled clams for $1 50 and 3 cajum wing for $1 00 each   everything was delicious   the service was awesome   always attentive   asked for my wings to be "not spicy"  and the cheff was able to accomodate to our desire   since the wings have cajun sauce over it   definitely recommended   will come back soon 
one star for crappy management! we had a 30 dollar off the bill groupon (spent 18 so basically they lose 12 bucks) i told the waitress i had a groupon she said we can't use it for happy hour so we thought that's fine cause we ordered happy hour items and 4 boiled items and the umi pasta so the bill came out to 250 bucks they wouldn't let us use the groupon cause we bought a couple of happy hour items so it was either choose happy hour price (which deducted only 15 bucks off the bill) or choose groupon and we kept saying waitress said this and the management kept saying you can't combine cause we lose money then dont do a groupon and happy hour he made us so upset especially because our bill was 250 after speaking to waitress he finally took it off cause she said it was miscommunication but he doesn't realize because he was so concerned of losing (12 bucks really not 30) off a 250 dollar bill that he would lose customers forever and now we will never go back cause too bad we did enjoy it   it's common sense please the customer because we would have been so appreciative and want to go back and spend another 250 bucks without a groupon  good job cheap jerk
i went there with my 2 yr old toddler and husband  husband was not impressed with the food  i was ok  service wasn't that great  maybe our server was new? but it took a while to acknowledge us after we got seated  fried calamari sauce is definitely more asian style based  my husband was expecting more italian style  the dip was a sweet and sour sauce  i got some sausages  which looks like they were slivered from some kielbasa i can get whole from the supermarket for $3 29 and i was charged $3  i went there for the raw bar   clams hit the spot and was quite fresh  squid ink pasta was alright  it more like squid ink sauce instead of the pasta itself that's black  seafood is definitely fresh  but i wouldn't call this place family friendly  this is right by skyview  so i guess they're trying to make it fancy  but i wouldn't go out of my way to return for the price i paid and not much choices for my 2 yr old 
love love the garlic noodles!! love the chicken!! love the steak!! love the corn!! love the deserts !! love the drinks especially "love affair"  its great for the weather  the restaurant is cozy and everyone has great vibes  lets just say you do not have to eat seafood to come to naked crab and love it  my new favorite spot 
rack of lamb  duck breast  lobster roll  and cajun boils are all delicious! parking is easy! definitely come back!
great service  great food  such a great market for the supply and demand in the best location  i see great success in the future  drove from new jersey to try this restaurant  can't wait to come back!
this review is a focus on their ayce  which is monday through thursday  but they are super crowded on the weekend even without their all you can eat menu selection  because i've only had non ayce here once    on the weekend and it was full house    from waiting  bar  to dining     i've been here multiple times and experienced the before and after price hike   and still worth it! still love it! from their service to their food and drinks   just good vibes all around they have a very friendly and outgoing crew for staff on the floor  and i've had the pleasure of meeting and speaking with their managers as well  koyo  kay  and general manager charles as well  any problems  they resolved it with a smile  they visited the table every visit and would converse and welcome feedbacks and suggestions  just great experiences every time  highly recommended!!example at about 7 40pm on a monday    the estimated wait time was an hour and thirty minutes when we spoke with the host  however  we were seated at about 8 25pm 832pm finished placing our food order with jackie and by 842pm about half the food is on the table  with the drinks  (highly recommend jackie as a server as well  because he brought us everything ordered  nothing was missing or forgotten ) food  some meat selections on the ayce menu is sliced so thin it's better for shabu shabu than bbq  because it sticks on the grill and tears apart  (fyi  *only four meat orders can be placed at a time *happy hour all day at the bar only   otherwise  after 9pm from the dinner table *make your reservations asap   because same day reservations cant be taken within two hours  (unless they aren't busy at all   which doesnt really happen   always popular  therefore busy!) and they only take two large parties on the weekends *they accept up to four credit cards per table  so large groups get cash ready!!* manhattan location near time sq  had some drink options not available at this location * get their app before you go  esp  if you are a new user    give it over 5 hours prior to be safe and you'll get a $10 off $30 offer  and you get to collect points every time you dine  just remember to ask them to split the receipts so everyone can get their own points for their account   each receipt can only be scanned once for points  * they don't have wifi but you can use the wifi from starbucks across the street  *most of their tables seats four people  even if you're dining alone  you'll get a big comfortable table all to yourself  ( first come first serve !)
waiters are extremely nice  they have alot of combo deals and their proteins are marinated very nicely  usually when you order  they'll arrange it from the cheaper cut to expensive cut  they recommend where to cook your food  whether it should be on the outer edges or the center so they are very informative  they have happy hour cocktails and drinks and they change out the iron grill pretty often! overall  a nice experience  can get pricey depending on the cuts of meat you get but that's up to your own discretion  cheers!
four of us came for sunday lunch  we ordered the samurai package and supplement it with additional pork and vegetable dishes    it was really very tasty  all the meat was tender and well seasoned  i also like their sauces at the table   they give you a sheet to show you how to grill each meat and the minutes  etc   certain dish they will grill for you and certain you have to do on your own  i prefer they do it all because i like to focus on eating   )  in all  it was very good and i would like to come back for their ayce   the course ends with smors which you grill the marshmallow on your own   nice touch also  although there is no exhaust  the smoke was not terrible and doesn't get into your hair clothes   the ambiance of restaurant is cozy and comfy and typical of traditional japanese restaurants  expect a nice greeting of irasshaimase! from the staff (i rounded up) but 1 2 star off for not being able to understand our waitress  very heavy accent 
my boyfriend and i came here to celebrate valentines day a day early since both of us were busy on the actual holiday  when we arrived (tuesday at 6pm)  the restaurant was pretty empty  so we were seated right away  our server  victor  was super helpful and guided us through the menu  as it was both of our first time  we ended up choosing the ultimate  which was the ayce option for $45 per person  we asked what he recommended and got them all!out of everything we ordered  i definitely recommend these items   harami miso skirt steak  beef tongue  filet mignon ponzu  bone in kalbi  spicy tuna volcano  s'mores and ice cream  ) every time a dish came out  we were informed how long to cook each meat  the servers were constantly changing the plate on the grill  which was nice  overall  the service and food was a++  we got lucky because by the time we left  there were a bunch of people waiting in the waiting area  it gets a little loud during prime time but i would definitely recommend  make sure to come hungry because you'll leave with a food baby
so we are back  this was a greater disappointment than last time  we have been to gyu kaku many times and in different spots  including hawaii  but this was the first time we were given frozen beef  like the pieces were frozen together  we let our server know and she brought out a new plate  when the manager came over i told her about it and when i checked the new beef that was frozen as well  what is going on?!!!  ok so not only was it frozen but it did t taste the same  this location is very different than the others  won't be back  even though it's a shorter drive and cheaper parking  manhattan we will go 
the abiance is nice  the employees are well mannered  i really liked the food and the experience  it's a lot like korean bbq places where you cook your meats  my friend and i ordered the meat lovers special  it came with 5 different meats that were well seasoned  it also came with salad  miso soup  edamame  and white rice  and for dessert  it came with smores (you get to heat up your marshmallow over the grill)  it says it's good for 2 people but you can share with 3 and still come out full! the manager came by our table to make sure everything went well  they have happy hour on drinks and food (anything prices that are red on the menu)  over all i give this place 5 stars btw you do now want to drive here because it's in the middle of main street aka china town  very crowded and no parking on the street 
had a friend tell me that this wasn't that good so i didn't try this place out immediately  but still wanted to know how it was  when i first arrived  it was about a 15 minute wait and we waited at the bar  when we were seated  service was a bit slow  but i review for the food mainly  ) surprisingly  the meat was really good; the toro beef and prime kalbi short rib was bomb  wouldn't reccomend the yaki shabu beef (was a bit dry and thick)  the harami in secret pot meat was so tender  the garlic fried rice got burnt cause the waiter took a long time to get us bowls  the tuna appetizer wasn't as good as i expected  but i didn't hate it either  still would come back to try more!
wow  what a great experience  the entire staff is amazing & super friendly  our servers chris & shek were extremely knowledgeable & had great recommendations  we made it just in time for the happy hour special  which is a combo of appetizers  assorted vegetables  rice & meat & chicken dishes  & to top it off s'mores for dessert  all for 50! & it tasted amazing  the manager  dennis  even passed by to make sure everything was ok  it was my first time here but i will 100% be back!
i wasn't a fan of gyu kaku the first time i had it  although their happy hour drink prices are pretty damn amazing  i decided to give it another try when my friends wanted to try this "hot new restaurant" in downtown flushing  and i was hoping that its location away from the city meant better quality and better value  came here with 2 other friends and we weren't super hungry to begin with  so we ordered the kobe style set  which is usually intended for 2 people  we all got our fair share of each course and even if we were a group of 2  we'd only eat just a bit more of what we had  although i am a fan of kobe beef  i didn't think it was anything special  the meat quality was good  but portions felt small  then again  i'm generally not a fan of bbq sets because the portions always feel small and being a carnivore  there never seems to be enough meat our waiter was very attentive and came and changed our grill rack often and brought out our food very quickly  the service  in general  is overtly friendly  i really admire the staff's high energy and (very) super enthusiasm when greeting guests in and out  i'd be dead tired by 8pm on a saturday my impression of gyu kaku still stands  decent quality but very expensive  small portioned food  their happy hour deals  on the other hand  are worth going for but i'm not sure if i'd pay full price for their drinks or food unless  of course  some friends want to go 
update to my original review  i introduced a buddy of mine to this gyu kaku location recently and they have been hooked ever since  not only is the food still very good but the employees and management have always been spectacular there is a new all you can eat special deal monday   thursday at participating locations  for budget minded people there are two options   a premium and ultimate menu  the former is less expensive with a certain number of menu items while the latter contains more grill options as well as certain things like sukiyaki bibimbap and garlic fried rice for a bit more  drinks are still charged separately but you do get a dessert option included (usually s'mores)  and i may have not noticed before but there are also bbq sets that are good for two diners (or one very hungry person) which include starters like salad and edamame when you walk up the stairs there may be quite a few customers waiting (especially during dinner time)  reservations are recommended but walk ins are certainly accepted based upon availability of seating  there have been more than one occasion where i had to wait for a bit but that was expected  the friendly faces at the podium you might encounter are always welcoming and they certainly remember you if you have dined more than once  thanks to deana and karen for always being pleasant and friendly  their position as primary contact for hungry and and sometimes impatient patrons can be overwhelming but they always manage to keep the waiting area calm  depending on when you decide to dine in i have noticed that the severs are sometimes different   understandable as people do have different availabilities and schedule  my original server waan i think i have seen once since i have been back  she was still working as hard as ever and had a different hairstyle  chris takes very good care of his customers  he was one of my original servers as well  he remembers peoples faces and still takes time to say hello even if he is not assigned to your table  as server is he very professional and thorough  victor is very friendly and polite to every table he is assigned to  he was training at one point but now is seasoned to be as efficient as his colleagues  janice made a good impression on our table  she checked up on us very frequently to make sure everything was all right even though happened to be somewhat busy that evening  and she took time to say hello to us even when we were seated in a different section on a different occasion  eric is very personable  even when not on duty or getting off shift he still takes time to greet customers in the common area  as a server he certainly is able to build rapport with customers and works very diligently to make sure orders arrive in a timely manner  special mentions go to dennis and ian who greet regular customers   howard took care of me most recently and takes responsibilities very seriously  the management team consistently show how much they care about the customers  koyo is always courteous and friendly as he deals with a lot of customers  charles and dennis make several rounds to check tables for grill changes and to see how customers are doing  kay certainly looks out for customers to make sure they are having a good experience  they take time to introduce themselves and what i respect about them is that they work alongside the staff whether dressed in stylish business attire or not  i am not sure if this is a common things at other locations  the teamwork at this location is very admirable 
this place is awesome! came here for the 1st time on a thursday night and had wan as our server  they gave us a happy hour menu which was so affordable for 3 people! the entire staff was smiling and super friendly! the food was delicious and everything was explained to us from how long to cook the food and it was brought out at a timely fashion  we were not overwhelmed with so many options at once on the table  i highly recommend people to come here especially during the happy hour!
this place was great! first time and definitely not my last  the food was tasty the drinks were strong and not to mention the service  we got the happy hour house menu samurai for 4  it's worth every penny and you leave full  )
i was super excited that there was a gyukaku opening in flushing  i've been to their locations in the city and really liked the food   but the experience here was not as good as other locations  i guess i went here on an off day (sunday afternoon) so first off  don't open the left door    that leads to a downstairs kitchen of some sort  make sure to stay on the right   would be good to put a sign to indicate the right door it will lead you to a set of stairs   upon entering the hostess wasn't present  when she returned she asked if we had a reservation (which i didn't) so we ended up waiting an additional 10 15 minutes   but the thing is  majority of the restaurant was empty and we were seated in an awkward location  a shared table that could seat 8 for a party of 2   ?  didn't really make sense usually upon arrival  staff would happily yell welcome or "irasshaimase!"  but instead staff yelled "irasshaimase     " it wasn't enthusiastic as other locations  and frankly they seemed really tired food spicy tuna volcano  tasted good  the seasoning of the rice itself reminded me of jia leurng (the fried dough wrapped in rice noodle)  but the crunchy rice was a bit hard to chew    this seems to be a popular item but i wasn't a fan   i guess this depends on personal preference  addicting cucumber didn't taste the same as the other locations  but it was okay   maybe it was a different sesame oil but the sauce wasn't as great sukiyaki bibimbap they readily offered korean mild and spicy  mild wasn't spicy at all   overall the taste just wasnt there like other places bistro hanger steak yaki shabu beef prime garlic shoyu steak  extremely seasoned  maybe marinated for too long or the ratio of seasoning was off   usually the meats are lightly marinated and it would've been okay to use the provided ponzu light soy spicy sauces at the table   but there was so much seasoning that using the table sauces woukd be going overboard pork belly  slices were not ideal for grilling  usually for grilling pork belly you try to aim to crisp up the edge a bit lychee lemonade  neutral?  tasted a bit like sprite mixed with lychee jellies  if you like that combo this might be for you our server was really nice  sometimes it was a bit hard to get him due to our seating area   but he was doing his best to tend to us   we were sat at the further end of the shared table that wasn't easily viewed (there was a partition that obstructs the view) he was really good at explaining the grill times  menus  etc   he also offered hand wipes at the end and a promo card with a secret freebie for next visit  i like those types of offers since they're pretty fun while leaving  usually someone would say thanks come again etc  but all the staff just stared as we left   we also saw the hostess looking upset and tearing up for some reason   overall  i'll give it a bit more time before returning  manager and waiter often asked how everything was so i know they're trying their best   for now i rather take the trip to the city for my gyukaku fix 
wow wow wow wow  my family and i just got back from eating dinner here and we are so glad the icook place down the street was busy  lol  we went there first and they had no tables that could seat 7 so we decided to come here and we are so happy that we did  like i said we came as a family of 7  5 adults and 2 children  we decided to do their special for 6 and that was more than enough for all of us  it comes with appetizers  soups and hey you get free edamame if you check in  some of the people at our table didn't like the rice but i personally liked it  it wasn't too mushy like most rice are at other places  we had three rounds of meats come out and when the third came we were all so full already  but we cooked it and took it home anyways  we gave some to our doggies  lol  so it really fed 7 people and 2 little dogs  mind you we ordered a pork fried rice too for those that didn't like the white rice   one thing i would like if they gave us lettuce but overall everything was delicious! would definitely come back in the future  the service was excellent! our server was attentive and always gave us everything promptly 
oh my gosh does this place have so many deals! and i would say it is worth it  they offer a lot of variety bbq wise at least  and drinks! gotta point out the drinks!!they also provide all you can eat bbq but certain days i believe  i went with a group of four and we did the $60 combo that's originally for two and we got full  now i know this is a chain  i had gyu kaku in chicago before  i remember liking chicago's more for some reason  everything was good but some i didn't care about  service was cool  we came around the time they opened  hostess didn't even know we were standing there but she was nice  waitor was super cool  all the staff was really nice actually  super informative  super helpful and outgoing and laid back at the same time  the interior is nice also  cute date night seen  it wasn't busy going around lunch time on saturday  you have to go up stairs to get up to the restaurant  i probably would have preferred to try another place but the cheapest option and i didn't want get too full
decided to take my mom here since we were in the area and we were craving japanese bbq  i made a reservation for 2 pm on a saturday for 2 and when my mom and i arrived at 1 45  we were told to wait a few minutes since someone else was still there  nonetheless  we waited and we were seated at exactly 2 pm! great service hands down once we sat down  we were greeted by eric  who was great throughout the entire time  he asked if we've been here before and i have been to their other locations throughout the city  so we skipped the whole speal and i ordered right away we got one of the happy hour sets (not sure which one) but everything tasted great  i really enjoyed the salad as they dressed it really well without it being too saucy  the meats were all fresh and beautifully cut seasoned!i was surprised that the place wasn't super crowded for a saturday afternoon  so definitely come here if you're in the area!
incredible food and fantastic service!! this place is so damn good! i like japanese bbq but the appetizers here is what really gets me every time  if you like spicy tuna  the spicy tuna volcano is to die for!! fried rice is really good and so is the bibimbap  if you come here during happy hour drinks are really cheap and everything on the menu is a few dollars off which is awesome  every time i go we end up getting a ton of stuff and are able to eat a little bit of everything for really cheap  only down side is the location is in the heart of flushing and parking is a pain  make sure to make a reservation as well so you don't need to wait because they get busy (every day of the week) 
love this place! have been to a few locations and they never disappoint  make sure to make reservations even on a weekday  they book up fast 
amazinggg! i made a reservation at 9 30pm and waited for about 10 minutes for them to set our table  i thought the restaurant was quite small but it extends all the way to the back  the table is very spacious and the seats are very comfy  our waiter  danny was very accommodating  gave us great recommendations and would service us in a timely manner  my boyfriend and i decided to go for the happy hour for 2 meal set and as for drinks  tokyo sunset and mango mai tai  i ate at the manhattan location a few years back and it seems like they changed their menu a bit but it did not disappoint at all  for starters we had miso soup  a gyu kaku salad  steamed chili shrimp dumplings  fried bacon chips and beef sukiyaki bibimbap  the dumplings were pretty good   not sure if it is freshly made in store but the chili on top was very tasty  the fried bacon strips was interesting  it came with lemon and salt on the side  i didn't think it needed the extra salt but it tastes a bit like fried chicken     maybe from the batter they fried it in  the bibimbap was also very good and a good portion to share amongst two people  we ordered a spicy tuna volcano in addition since this appetizer seems popular  it was nice and crunchy on the outside of the rice and topped with just the right amount of spicy tuna  i think i will prefer the rice block to be a bit smaller in size and a bit more crunchy  other than that  it was a great appetizer!for bbq  we had the harami miso skirt steak  bistro hanger steak & toro beef soy first  all meats were very good and i liked how we can cook base son our preference even though the waiters advise you beforehand on how long you should cook your meat  next was the garlic shoyu chicken thigh  pork belly white soy and spinach garlic  we didn't enjoy eating the chicken  it was tasteless and wasn't as juicy as the beef dishes  the pork belly was okay  we still preferred the beef  the spinach was surprisingly very good  it was also very easy to cook  we ordered a kalbi short rib in addition to our meal and it's probably our favorite beef slice amongst all  lastly  we had s'mores that came with the meal as well as the fried banana cheesecake with ice cream  the s'mores was such a fun and cute idea  the banana cheesecake was okay  i didn't enjoy it that much since i'm not into banana flavored things but my boyfriend enjoyed it ~ i did like the ice cream a lot though! we managed to finish all our food but we walked out so stuffed  it's definitely a nice  chill place to have dinner  don't forget to check in on yelp for a free bowl of edamame!
great spot  glad they've opened one on main st  happy hour after 9pm on a saturday night? count me in  drinks were inexpensive and service was on point  we ended up grabbing a table and ordering their 6 people special    for 5 people  it was awesome  sooooo much food   grills were changed frequently before we had to ask  you get free edamame with your yelp check in but that might take a while to come out  the staff is always polite and fun  our waitress shared a picture of someone's burnt marshmallow disaster from an earlier shift  she was great  this place is always fun  always count me in for cheap beer and s'mores 
been to a few locations in the city and chicago as well  don't know how they do it but they definitely nailed quality control! from the service to the food  i don't even notice when i am in a different location  the bbq is amazing! my boyfriend and i usually order the gyu kaku for 2 combo  the meat is marinated just right  they make slits in the meat so it guarantees all parts of the meat will catch the marinade  the grills are smokeless so you don't have those smoke vacuums over your food (like in korean bbq)  the beef bibimbap is seasoned nicely and scorched perfectly! btw add the mushroom packets if your gonna have bbq  if you need some alcoholic suggestions  the lychee bellini and mango mai tai is really good 
jackie was our server for the evening  he was very nice  and helpful  he helped us understand and even recommended so really good drinks  he was patient and our food came very very fast  our food was very very good  we got the happy hour special  very fast and fun !but jackie was the best !!! thank you so muchhhhh!!
such a fun time  our waiter was funny  knowledgeable and prompt  this is my go to in flushing with a group of friends for an entertaining time 
the husband and i came here for our lunch date last friday afternoon  we heard this location opened up not too long ago and have been meaning to come here to try since we've had it at the cooper square location before there was no wait whatsoever  i think partially because it was a weekday and in the afternoon  there were plenty of empty tables when we got there  no reservations needed  phew  we were afraid of that since we had a doctor's appointment scheduled right after lunch we opt for the *premium party course* ($40 for 2 people) from the lunch special because we wanted kobe style bbq meat!starters & sides  salad x2 miso soup x2rice x2bbq items  kobe style bistro hanger steak miso kobe style sirloin steak sweet soy new york strip steak garlic pork belly white soy assorted vegetablesdessert  s'mores x2tip  get free edamame when you follow gyu kaku on instagram or like their fb page! you might have to remind them a few times that you liked their fb page because we did and didn't get the edamame until later later later on  humph  anyhow   the salad was a fantastic kick starter!! love the delicious dressing and the spring mix is super fresh! the miso soup was great  not too bland or salty  seaweed and tofu tasted good too the white rice was a bit hard and rough  tasted as if it was put in the reheat setting for too long  i think i was expecting the softer korean rice  but we are in a japanese restaurant  shrugs the kobe style bbq meat was overall good  i was not too crazy over the pork belly since there was an after taste to it  i also didn't really like the ny strip steak either because it was not marinated like the rest of the meat we did not care much for the vegetables  we only got like 2 rolls of onions  2 pieces of mushrooms  2 slices of red peppers  and 2 slices of cucumbers  meh the s'mores were a nice end to our meal  yummy toasted marshmallows on top of hershey chocolate with crunchy graham crackers!***i think our biggest complaint was they split our orders of meat vegetables in half and the second half did not come until after we finished eating the first half  since it is self service aka we grill the food by ourselves  we expected everything to be on the table for us to grill at our leisure  we were also on a time constraint so we did not finish our lunch until 1 5 hours later  sigh to the slow raw food delivery other than that  it was a nice grilling experience  well  the husband did all the legwork while i sit back and enjoyed the eating hehe  i love me a husband that takes charge!
i made a reservation for 7 45pm  however  was seated at 8 02pm   the place was packed for a monday evening and the hostess said that the table that was occupying our reservation was there for 3 hours that's why there was such a delay   the staff was apologetic for the delay but it didn't change the fact that we had to wait excess of 15 minutes with a reservation  i came here with a party of 6 people and ordered the set for 6 people   the food was good and the service was amazing   our waiters name was brandon and he was so attentive and helpful   his service and attitude was definitely a 5 star in my books   he came by to constantly change the grill when it got a bit charred and to refill our water   i wasn't quite full from this set for 6 people and we ordered extra items too  we ordered garlic noodles  bibimbap and 2 veggies   i didn't leave here feeling hungry but i also didn't leave feeling full   happy hour is at 9pm to closing  which makes the drinks almost half off   i would definitely come back here in the future and hope to have brandon as my server   great overall experience for a restaurant that has only been opened for 3 months 
1st time i went to this location & i realized they dont have the matcha crepe & takoyaki yet which sucks cuz those 2 dishes are amazing from this place  i recommend the mango lemonade over the lychee lemonade as the lychee lemonade is pretty tart  the garlic rib eye & the yaki shabu are too sweet  i think all the meat they serve is seasoned sweet by default unless you ask them to make sure the sauce or seasoning isn't sweet  the veggie noodles were ok the chili wings are too sweet the steamed chili shrimp dumplings were spicy & so good!the spicy cucumber wasn't spicy at all but it was crispy  the fried calamari was good cuz of the thousand island sauce the mochi ice cream had 4 flavors of 2 each  thai tea  strawberry  matcha  & vanilla  thai tea is best  matcha is 2nd (not too bitter)  vanilla ranks 3rd as it didnt have much flavor  i honestly couldn't taste the vanilla  strawberry is last cuz it was too sweet i dont like the fact that the spicy sauce they have on the table is sweet & nowhere near spicy at all the locations  they said they do have actual hot sauce & we just need to ask for it  this location had the best service by far 
4 5 stars for this korean bbq place  came here twice for the happy hour and i'm very pleased with both experiences  we ordered the tuna volcano appetizer (great) and the spicy bibimbap (great) and the chicken garlic noodles (just ok because it was lacking the ground chicken it promised on the menu)  the drinks are good too  especially the strawberry margarita and lychee mojito  the good red meats for grilling are not discounted for happy hour  so  5 stars taken away for that  we usually get the skirt steak  short rib and filet mignon  from happy hour  we tried the basil chicken and assorted veggies  all pretty good! we will def be coming back! good place to try out any time of the day  they also have an app with discounts and for points towards menu item redemptions 
this is the worst restaurant experience that anyone can have  we got to the restaurant at 7 30pm and was told that it was a busy night  but they will be able to accommodate us if we were willing to wait 45 to 50 minutes  understanding that it was saturday dinner time we waited patiently  after about an hour we were told that it will be another 15 to 20 minutes because the table that they planned to seat us at were finishing up and about to have dessert  again we waited and kept seeing other parties come in and being seated right away as more people were leaving the restaurant so we know tables were opening up  i asked about our table and they kept saying that the party at our table were still finishing up  we would've left  but by this point we had already waited so long that we didn't want to go to another restaurant to wait again thinking that our table will open up soon  we ended up waiting over 2 hours before we were seated! this is very unprofessional  if they knew they were going to accommodate others first then they should've been honest from the beginning  we had an elderly couple in our party and they were starting to get nauseous from the hunger!the dining experience was extremely poor  when we were seated someone came to take our order  but when food started to come out we were missing quite a few items so we inquired about it  we found out that the person who took the order was not actually our waiter and some of the orders were not placed  our waiter apologized and said that since it was so busy and people were getting seated at the same time so he asked someone (probably a bus boy) to fill in and take our orders while he went to greet another table  during our meal our waiter came to refill water in our glass  but the the problem is that we were drinking pellegrino and my glass was still half filled sitting right next the the pellegrino bottle! he apologized and brought out another bottle  but after the experience we've had so far in this place it was hard to be understanding  the whole night was a sh1t show!!!the food itself was also not that great  one of the dishes that we decided to try was their $32 kobe ribeye  this was one of their "specialty dishes"  to be honest  i could've gotten better steak for the value from my local pizzeria! when this thing came out  it was 6 paper thin slices of meat  to compare it to sliced deli roast beef would be an extreme compliment! i've had some great kobe beef from very high end steak houses (so i know my red meats)  and i know that i can't expect that kind of quality here  but this thing was pure garbage (not tender at all  with absolutely no taste)!all in all we spent about 4 hours in this place because by the time we left it was just about 11 30pm  that's 4 wasted hours of my life that i wish i could take back  there are so many other great asian style bbq places featuring marinated meats in flushing that i don't recommend anyone wasting their time and money on this one  i'll definitely be "flushing"this place down the toilet  i'm usually a pretty easy going kind of person  and don't really care to write reviews and stuff  but this was soooo bad that it's worth warning others about  if there was a negative star rating available for this place  i would've given it that!
oh my oh my oooooh my!!!i don't know where to begin! so i was going on a date and i picked thid spot b c of the reviews  and let me tell you they didn't disappoint! once you enter the staff says this greeting i can only assume was in japanese and we found out that the greeting is the host says we have new guests and the staff responds with a welcome greeting  and they are loud let me tell you l  so you definitely feel welcomed!once we were seated our server came over his name was eric  he was such a super nice guy   he explained how the ordering went and let us know that we cook ourselves  since it was indeed our first time there  so that was different  i informed them that it was my birthday celebration and drinks must flow  lol we ordered a variety of things like squid  chicken  seaweed salad  mushrooms  veggies and fish  it all was so good and the fact that the grill is right there on the table for you to cook was suoer cool  he also explained how long to cook each item which was helpful   it all comes out wrapped in foil and you  just place it on the grill to cook  my date also ordered a japanese beer and sake and i had a lychee bellini with extra lychees b c of my love for lychees and it was oh so good  ken the bartender made my drinks and they were very good after we ate and were just chatting a bit all of a sudden i hear "someone' s having a birthday!!!" super loud and it startled me but i loved it! the whole staff had to be like 10 or so of them came and sang happy birthday to me! it was so energetic i loved every moment of it  they gave me a crown and had signs and everything  so if you don't like the big fuss for your birthday then don't tell them  but i like all that stuff so it was great for me!if you go here make sure to ask for eric as your server he is awesome  and he will talk a bit too  so if you don't want a server that can be chatty then do get him  however i like that he talked and engaged us a bit  made my experience more personal  like he knew us   also the manager came over to make sure everything was to our liking  which i greatly  appreciated  he was so nice and welcoming and always had a smile  i even talked to him at the end and he was still smiling and thanked us for coming  i want to say his name is danny  but i don't think that's right   either way he was great  the whole staff was awesome everyone just made sure you were enjoying yourself   oh and they have am evening happy hour too that starts around 9p if you missed the earlier happy hour   needless to say i am definitely going back   
i love this jbbq restaurant so much! gyu kaku is a chain jbbq resturant  they have a few in manhattan and they just opened one in flushing  great idea honestly  i'm literally here about 3 4x a month  i love coming here because they have great deals  they always have happy hour for the food and for the drinks  they have so many things on the happy hour menu and i order so much food an drinks  it's a great ambiance  the service is always great too  the waiters are super nice  it does get packed here at night  but they let you sit by the bar and order drinks as you wait  smack in the middle of flushing  so its really easy to get to 
yes!!! a gyu kaku in flushing! location is awesome  parking sucks but still doable! deals  prices all standard but what is important is the food and service! food is phenomenal like always  the restaurant looks nice  although the walk way isn't that spacious  our waiter   eric? i believe was extremely helpful and nice  i actually went 2 times in one week because it was just that awesome! even if you can't make a reservation online you can always give them a call and they'll work something out  they've also been very helpful with the reservation when i was unsure if we were going with 5 or 6 people  the second time i went it seems like they were short on staff  i went on a sunday night  it was pretty busy  the place was full with more people waiting but there seems to be only 3 waiters 
this was a great experience though the waiter try to rush us through our meals  it's very easy a child could even cook the food  (around 45 seconds on both sides) this restaurant is reasonably priced and affordable for anyone the spicy tuna volcano and fried rice are must haves !!!
it is really good here!! there's always a line  make sure you make reservations!! order their combos!! it is pretty fulfilling!!!
update  i stopped by again to grab a quick dinner at the bar  the bar prices stay at the new happy hour prices all day  so it's a really good deal i got the lychee tini (which was sweet  just the way i like it)  an avocado salad (so good!)  and the shoyu ramen  the ramen came in a very good portion and i was full before even finishing it  compared to the grill  if you just want a quality  cheap dinner  the bar is the place to be  you still get the great foods that gyu kaku offers (obviously without the meats) along with discounted drinks  i will definitely be stopping by here a lot more 
we made reservations at 5 30pm for 5 people  got seated right away  but for 10 mins nobody acknowledged us and we were ready to order  we had to wave someone down to come take our order  since happy hour ends at 6pm and we got there at 5 30pm we had the advantage to order a combo for 2 people for $50 dollars with a bit of everything which was awesome  so we ordered 2 of those $50 combo plus a mixture of other goodies on the menu  the bacon chips was a waste  tiny bits of fried bacon with a side of salt  portion was very tiny  i suggest you save your $5 and get something else   since we ordered so much stuff i don't remember all that came with the $50 combo but i do know there was definitely 2 types of beef  chicken  pork  veggies  soup  salad  rice  edamame  and s'mores  and when you check in you also get a free order of edamame  they do offer discount when you download their app which was nice   the place didn't make our clothes smell which is extra plus! overall it was good besides having to hunt down somebody to order in the beginning  our waiter did end up switching with another waitress to serve us and she was awesome  she changed our grill at least 4 times to prevent our food from cooking on the burnt surface which was nice 
this is my favorite bbq place to go to  i've been to their other locations in the city and this one is just as good  the meat was very tasty and well seasoned  they will tell you how long to grill each type of meat and they change the grills for you once in a while  there is usually a wait during dinner so it is best to make a reservation beforehand  i did not try the acye option because i came on a weekend  the other locations does not have the ayce option  i will definitely be back for that next time 
came here for lunch  i wanted to come this past monday for the all you can eat but they don't have it on weekday holidays came here to order the ultimate 56 item all you can eat  when i entered  it was quite busy  i remembered that the restaurant used to be a karaoke bar  at the restroom and waiting area  there are two tvs showing sports in the main level  i see that there is a bar next to the stairs with two more tvs  this is the second restaurant that offer all you can eat  with the other on in white plains while there  the service is good  instead of a knob at the side of the table to control the heat  there is a knob below the table  the table next to me had the warning light flashing  the waiter turned the knob  disabling the warning light this restaurant also has all you can drink sodas for two dollars extra  i order three cooked food items and nine grilled items  i always end the meal with ice cream and s'mores 
i finally got to try this place since they opened in flushing  i've been to the midtown location and loved it but it was mostly reserved for special occasions because it's on the pricey side in my opinion  that being said  i don't think they've ever done ayce at that location  i got an email about a deal for all you can eat on mon thurs for $35 ($45 for more items included) so i jumped on the deal  here are my general thoughts 1) i thought this deal was for a limited time  but i think they have this all the time during the weekdays (mon thurs)  i did make reservations  but i don't think you need to  i came on  a monday around 6 30 and there were plenty of tables open  2) everything we ordered was delicious  we did the regular $35 ayce menu because there was plenty on there for us to try for our first time  we got various different cuts of beef   some were more tasty than others but we couldn't really recall what was what  we really enjoyed the cubed beef and the really thinly sliced beef  the shrimp and the pork sausages were amazing too  we kept ordering more plates of those  for appetizers  i was obsessed with the cold tofu with scallions piled top   so delicious and refreshing  the fried calamari was good too  however  the star of the meal was their sweet soy sauce    soo good  i dunked everything in that sauce  3) it was really easy to cook the food  the beef goes in the center of the grill because they cook faster  about 30 90 seconds on each side (depending on how thick the cut)  whereas any other meat (chicken  pork  shrimp) and vegetables go on the outer parts of the grill  usually around 2 minutes per side  i like how they gave each of us a tong  so that everyone can partake in the grilling 4) they were really pleasant and nice to us in the beginning  always coming by to change out our grill and refill our waters  however  towards the end  i felt like they were a little pushy about getting us out  apparently  there is a 90 minute limit  now  i've been to other all you can eat buffets and i know they all have time limits too  but other places were never too strict about it and i never felt like someone was actually timing me  here  right about the hour and a half mark of our reservation time  they came by and said "last call for orders"  wow  really?? the place was more than half empty  it's not like we were even eating a lot  but we just like to take our time and enjoy our food instead of scarfing it down  this kind of ruined the experience for me and hence why i knocked off one star  overall  i thought the food was great  but the experience could have been better 
my mom actually wanted to try this place for my little brother's birthday dinner after we couldn't get a table the last we were here  now i can see why it's so popular  the food was really good  we came in the evening on a saturday expecting it to be busy  but it wasn't  we could've gotten a seat asap  but the host said that we needed to have everyone present before we could be seated (my dad was still parking his car)  so keep that in mind when you come here  after we were seat  we ordered the samurai set  $130  which feeds about 4 people  the samurai set comes with miso soup  gyu kaku salad  chicken garlic udon  and beef sukiyaki bibimbap as appetizers  seasoned filet mignon  sweet soy sirloin tare  harami  new york garlic strip steak  marinated kalbi  shrimp and mushroom ahijo  miso duck  chicken with pesto  and buttered asparagus as bbq items and s'mores as dessert  my favorites were the chicken garlic udon  kalbi  shrimp and mushroom ahijo  harami  and s'mores (obviously)  we all loved the kalbi so much we ordered 2 more lol i was the least impressed with the miso duck  chicken with pesto  and the bibimbap  my mom also ordered their mango lemonade  which was quite delicious  it was kind of pricey ~$160 not including tip  but i would definitely consider coming back again because i found their meats to be very flavorful and tender compared to most kbbq restaurants i've been to 
i was so excited for this place to open up in flushing  this gave me the push to actually go and try gyu kaku in manhattan  the experience i had in the cooper sq location was pretty bad; i gave them a 1 star review on yelp this new location is much better  the entrance is a big wooden door  i almost walked into some creepy looking place right next to the actual entrance  you have to climb a bunch of steps to get upstairs  we were seated after 5 minutes of waiting  every time a customer enters or leaves  the staff shouts something in japanese  this place is pretty nice and spacious  my boyfriend and i opted for the happy hour preset meal along with the spicy tuna appetizer  we also got the tokyo tea & mango mai tai  i've read on most of the manhattan locations that their drinks are all juice  it's watered down blah blah blah  this location does not cheat you on the alcohol!!our waiter  eric? i believe was very nice  he explained to us all the different kind of meats  the sauces  which cut is better  how long to grill them for  etc  i learned that if the meat is on a white plate  they are generally a better cut of meat  the bibimbap here is made in front of you and to perfection  the one i had in the manhattan location was way too salty  very brown  just horrible in general but this location changed my perspective on it the manager even stopped by our table to ask us how everything was and explained to us the future plans for the location!overall  i still think gyu kaku is expensive for what you get but it is a pretty good price during happy hour  the happy hours at this location is pretty much like half the day  if i were to come back  it would only be during happy hour and to this location 
i live in the neighborhood and this place used to be a karaoke before turning into a new location of this famous japanese bbq  my friends and i decided to check it out on a weekday evening  we came in around 9pm which is roughly their happy hours  there was quite a line but only a 5 mins wait  we ordered the gyu kaku set  the first one on the menu  and a couple of extra dishes  appetizers include edamame  miso soup  fried shrimp dumpling and rice  we also ordered the spicy tuna volcano but it was quite disappointing to me  if you want some veggies i suggest the spicy addicting cabbage  funny it is actually addicting  the meat was good quality but some of them were marinated more like korean bbq  like galbi  my favorites are the beef tongue  of course  and the butter garlic ny strips  the harami miso skirt steak was not that impressive  didn't taste much like miso  they also have corn with butter in foil cups so you can grill them up  i had a lychee mojito and it was delicious  green tea ice cream was okay not sure if it's because it's newly opened or not but the staff is really attentive and helpful  hope they can maintain the service  our bill totaled ~$40 not including tips 
first time here and i loved it! great service  great food! will definitely be back! everyone who works there is super friendly and helpful  a lot of variety of packages and reasonably priced!
this place has delicious food  i love the set up of their grills because it sucks the smoke downwards which keeps it from sticking to your clothes as much as other places  their happy hour specials are great! i would get the combo that comes with lots of appetizers and meat and even s'mores  the beef is consistently tender and well marinated  i liked that they gave a packet of spinach too  my favorite appetizer has been the chili shrimp dumplings  fairly priced for the food but some can say it's pricey especially in the flushing area  it's located down a small street  across from a starbucks 
went on a weeknight around 9pm and caught their ayce deal  their kitchen closes at 10 45pm but you're welcome to stay and finish your food  i think i didn't leave until maybe 11 30  the waiters were super nice and helpful in their suggestions  they also came back periodically to check up on us  i think the meat quality was really really good; all seasoned well  i never tried japanese bbq before so this was a really pleasant experience  i think i'll definitely be back!
super fresh thin cuts of meat and great service  don't be intimidated if you're new to japanese bbq like i was  don't go during rush hour without a reservation 
had a crave for japanese bbq and went to this place with my husband  we had a happy hour set dinner plus two appetisers  just enough for two of us  the quality of the meat is very high  i have had gyu kaku in hong kong  i think they have the same standard  although it's definitely cheaper in ny lol
came here around 10pm ish with a party of 2  found the wait to be about 10 minutes long first time trying gyukaku or any jbbq for the matter and it was a great experience  the server was very knowledgable (a little too knowledgable because me and my friend were both a bit too tipsy to comprehend everything)we were going to opt for the kobe style for 2 @ hh pricing but decided we dont wanna be charged for things we dont really want in the set  so we opted for individual orders  we had the pork belly  fried rice  garlic noodles  ny strip steak  kobe style  and 1 other meat  the portioning was decent and everything was easily sharable  the only difficult part was actually cooking the meat to perfection because both of us being lazy and sucky at cooking  most of our meats turned out a little burnt  regardless everything had a flavorful taste to it bill came out to around 50$ and we just left $10 tip  would definitely come back again 
i recently came here twice in a week  one was for lunch and one was for the ayce (all day long monday   thursday) lunch   i think we literally sat for close to 2 hours and we weren't rushed to leave  we opted for the 3 bbq items per person which also comes with rice  salad and soup  the choices we got to choose from were great  it was pretty filling since we also added 2 extra veggies  it's a good jap bbq experience if you don't want to spend too much  ayce   there's 2 options  a $35 one with less items and the $45 with the premium items  of course we went for the $45 one because there's so much more items to choose from  the food was really good and we got pretty stuffed  they were pretty strict with the 90 minutes but good thing we managed to get to the dessert part with 10 minutes left on the clock  but i have to say  it might've been because we ordered alot  i think we definitely ate our moneys worth  one thing i didn't really like was we were only allowed to order 2 meat dish per person per round so that it took longer to order everything we wanted but we eventually got too full anyways  overall  gyu kaku is amazing  their food is fresh and taste delicious  i definitely recommend going for lunch and ayce but don't go for the ayce if it's a large group because you have to share one grill and needs to be out by 90 minutes!
so glad they opened a location in flushing so that i can finally try gyu kaku! the prices are a steal for happy hour  whether you're getting tons of meat or drinks  don't expect to get super stuffed like at ayce  but definitely expect good quality meat with flavor  the sauces also pair perfectly with the meat  the happy hour special for 2 is just the right portion!the meat cooks super fast so make sure to watch it so it doesn't burn! unsure about everyone else's experience  but service was great when i went  my party was checked on regularly and even the head server came to ask us about how to better the experience there  i can see how this place can get super busy  so make sure to come early!
this is probably my go to japanese bbq restaurant  the best happy hour prices on both food and drinks  the energy the servers have is fantastic  everyone is very attentive and helpful  the service is fast and pleasant  the food is flavorful  you can cook all meats to your likings  appetizer are superb  i love the fact the restaurant provide a reward system so it makes you feel appreciated and always want to go back 
very slow  took us 3 hours to finish a normal 1 5 hour meal  waiter was nice but he was so busy that every thing was so backed up  asked for a tea and it took two request just to get it almost 15 minutes later  same with ordering soda  alot of sitting and waiting for food to come to the table every other dish  the meat wasnt that fresh  not even up to normal standard  the price was standard but the quality was way lower then what it was priced  the seating was uncomfortable and very compacted  not even enough walking space to even get through the place 
i've eaten at gyu kaku japanese bbq before (different location)  my son and i visited during the late night "happy hour"  my son loved the idea of cooking the food  i had been perusing the menu for a while since my last visit in midtown so i knew what i wanted we ordered  fried shrimp dumplings  french fries with cod caviar sauce  pork sausage fried rice  miso ramen pork  the meat    bistro hangar steak  filet mignon  chicken breast and pork belly my son loved the idea of cooking the food  i let him cook all the meat excluding the filet mignon (that's my fave)the employees were really friendly to us  especially since it was my son's first time there  being that it was halloween  everyone was wearing costumes  our orders were taken and our food rolled out pretty quickly!! our grill was cleaned and changed quickly and without interrupting our meal  our meal was pretty expensive  but it was worth it  we had a lot of food and ended up taking boxes home with us  being as though it was halloween  they gave my son a little halloween pumpkin basket with candy inside definitely look forward to returning again in the near future  it's new york so parking was pretty bad  especially since they're doing road construction close by 
my friend and i ordered the $60 gyu kaku for 2 (people) which includes 5 starters sides  6 variety of meat platters and the funnest part  which was making the dessert (s'mores!)  thoughts  food   i liked most of the sides & meat  it was deeelish! service   you have to grill it yourself but it's easy & pretty fun  they change the grill often and check up on you frequently! price   it was about $35 person  worth every penny! i'm not a big fan of bbq and i realized that it was because of the lack of variety (in an order since usually you'd order like 1 2 a lb or a lb of a certain type of meat)  but i started to like it after eating at gyu kaku japanese bbq and i definitely would want to go back there 
i'm not pleased with how they organized their hosts and seating arrangements  first off  the 5 minute wait is acceptable if we have no reservations  but once we are about to go up to the table  then you tell us we only have 30 minutes to an hour to eat  i find that unreasonable because the hosts did not tell us before hand while we were deciding to wait or not  aside from the hosts today not being clear and having to turn away and find somewhere else to eat  my previous visits have been delightful in their grand opening days; wonderful  attentive waiters who gave us the best service they could with so many other busy tables during the happy hours  our waiter had given us wonderful recommendations and we definitely enjoyed the meal even if our group of four had to empty out our pockets  ^^;although i'll be a return customer definitely  i sure hope they train their hostesses a little better 
nothing like grilling your own food! spicy tuna  chilli soy wings  and the addicting spicy cucumbers are just      out of the world (i'm salivating just thinking about it)  the meat (sorry vegetarians and vegans)    but the meat is also fresh! have really good flavors    my favorites are  yaki shabu beef sweet soy  the harami secret pot and the premium​ sirloin​ garlic! to top it off  you can make your own smores    
tastes so good! fast service  no wait  will come back  cute waitress too haha  drinks were okay  wish had more taste and punch! i got the lychee lemonade and miso ramen! so freaking good   p s chili dumplings amazing!  noise level was high but it was very busy
i've come here twice now and the first time had a really great experience and the second time a pretty good (but sort of odd) experience  there may have been an opening event the first time i came but there was a set meal for two that offered a variety of marinated beef that was all really tasty  it comes with s'mores at the end and was very affordable  we also came during happy hour so drinks were half off! the value and quality of the food during the weekdays is really good  so if you're available to go on a weekday that's best! i've heard all you can eat can get pricey at dinner time  the second time we came was also during happy hour  we ordered a 150 ml carafe of hot sake for around 4 5 dollars during happy hour  it never came out even after the waitress told us it was coming after about 10 minutes and our appetizers had been served  i asked her again and she said she'd check  then came back and said they didn't have any more that day  i told her it was okay  but she recommended a very pricey bottle instead that was 20 dollars even during happy hour  we ordered an alternative that was a little less expensive but felt like the interaction was odd  the food comes out and we start grilling   no complaints here  everything was good again  toward the end  a manager comes over and introduces himself and asks us if we're enjoying everything  we said we were okay and had liked everything  he prodded us a little and asked us if we were sure (??) and to let him know if there was anything we left feeling like the food was good  but the service felt a little uncomfortable  we would try it again though as we had a good time the first time we came 
we had such a great time at this restaurant! i'm blown away the food was absolutely delicious and fresh  great spot for a date night or a night out with friends  our server was very friendly and helped us pick out all of our food  we started with the tuna volcano sushi and the japanese fried wings amazing  then we got the premium steak and this delicious rice  at the end of our visit the manager visited us and made us feel at home  we will definitely be back!
service is good and food is good  drinks are happy hour $5  great   but the food at the end of it getting the combo i have a salty after taste in my mouth  everything good just a bit salty  only give a three star because it a bit salty  but everything else is great  good place for group or date  got the kobe combo it's great but have to say again for my taste bud it's salty
one word  hot  the food  great  the service  excellent  my partner and i were craving japanese bbq and we were anti manhattan so we made our way to flushing  little did we know that they had just recently opened  but to our surprise  it was running so smoothly that it felt as if it had been there for years  my recommendation is to make a reservation as we had to wait roughly 40 minutes  the place is not large  but they did a great job of making it feel roomie  we were greeted by our waiter who was excellent  he was super attentive and gave us the full experience  we reviewed the menu and rather than order the set  we ordered a la carte  for appetizers  we were the spicy dumplings and the spicy tuna volcano  the dumplings were good and the sauce that covered it was great! the spicy tuna volcano was also pretty good though it seemed pretty standard  as for the bbq  we got a ton of different meats and veggies and went to town  meats marinated nicely and everything tasted so fresh  many of the other waiters checked in on us which we loved along with the manager  it was a friday night when we got there and we noticed that all the guys were really good looking  we hit the jackpot  we left so satisfied  will definitely be back grade  a
new spot in flushing for some self grilled meats   3 5 starsthis place is on the 2nd floor on the corner of main street and 41st street   it is not handicap accessible  there's about 3 flight of stairs   if you are visiting with elderly folks or people with handicap  i would think twice before visiting as a regular fan of korean bbq  the meat here tasted more flavorful since they marinate it  so it really depends on what you're in the mood for made a reservation for 8 45pm friday  however when my group got there we had to wait about 15 minutes   host at the front was apologetic  however i was hungry!after my table was seated  the waitress explained the items on the menu and was very helpful   since my table made it for happy hour (9pm   closing daily)  we opted to order a set for two  and ton of meats from the happy hour items   not all items qualify for happy hour  so i guess the cheaper cuts of meats had happy hour prices  which was still decent the meat were marinated well and needs about 50 seconds   1 5 minutes depending on how rare or well you want it cooked on the grill   vegetables in foil packages takes about 2 minutes per side   the garlic marinated beef was probably the best tasting in my opinion   the miso soup that came with the set was super salty   i had to tell the manager that they added too much salt when he came around asking how is everything   he gave me another miso soup to test out and it was better   the waitress changed our grills often between each meat when it became charred black   the fried rice was made table side and that tasted pretty good   spicy tuna volcanos tasted good  but the rice was on the harder side mixed drinks were on the sweeter side   i ordered a peach sunset and it seems like they added too much syrup and no enough alcohol   after the meal was done  the manager offered a choice of ice cream on the house since we had to wait for our table even though we had reservations   my group of 5  and they only brought 4 green tea ice cream   that didn't make sense  maybe cause one of the person in my table was a child  but still   it would've made sense to give us 5 desserts 
something different than your average restaurants in flushing  we came in a group of 6  so it made sense for us to get the set for 6  had to say the variety was great but the portion was just alright  each of us averaged to two pieces per dish  we ordered extra things from the menu too but most of us still didn't feel full  my favorite was definitely the s'mores  it was so cute and you get to make it yourself   )4 stars  the set included appetizers  entrée  and desserts  & since you cook it yourself  you get to control how you want your beef to be  however  4 stars  mostly because the customer service was phenomenal  it is difficult to find staffs that are so welcoming and attentive to your needs  our server  brandon was great  he really shared his insights about what he liked and what he didn't really liked  he even mentioned to us what sauce was more popular etc  i thought was pretty neat  usually staffs just tell you what is good which sometimes just sounds like mere advertisement  dishes off the table quickly  waters were refilled without being asked  and kept up with all our needs  overall  the experience was pretty good  keep up the good work! can possibly improve on the portion size? tip  get drinks during happy hour  ^^ 9pm   closing 
ordered the shogun off the happy hour menu for my party of 6  we ordered some additional plates of meat and shrimps  definitely a place for meat lovers  everyone were satisfied with the food  i don't eat any beef so the only things i ate were the chicken and shrimps  i ended up eating a lot of the salad  apps  and rice  they change the grill very often so your food doesn't get charred  the manager seems attentive and goes around to ask how her patrons are doing and asks for suggestions on any improvements they need to make  overall  we had a great dinner with great service 
i love this place  get the kobe and wagyu  it's a bit pricey but so worth it  the meat melts in your mouth  service was excellent!!thank you kay for being an awesome server!  it's also really hard to find places with real wagyu beef imported from japan  if you're in flushing and craving some a+ quality meat   this is your spot 
this was one of my favorite place to eat at  the environment and service was really good  everybody was really friendly and the food was amazing 
amazing service & food  and dennis and eric are stand out workers  we came in last week during the snowstorm and they were clearly understaffed but eric handled his tables and the bar flawlessly  he still made sure to keep his numerous patrons beyond happy  we also came in yesterday and witnessed a situation at the bar  dennis handled the entire thing with poise and professionalism  i was amazed with his demeanor throughout the time  can't stop raving about the staff here!
as someone living in auburndale  you can imagine my excitement upon learning that this place opened up on flushing main street  it's awesome being able to enjoy yakiniku without having to make my way down all the way out to manhattan!while i was originally excited to go in for the yakiniku fun  i found myself going in more and more for the bar specials  if i'm by myself i usually go for the $14 bar special  which allows you to choose to appetizers from a plentiful list  as well as either a beer or a small carafe of hot sake  if you're light weight though  that small carafe is probably all you need and will last you for a while  so this is the deal for you! i tend to go for their addicting cabbage  which believe me  lives up to the "addicting" in its name  on top of that i go for the spicy tuna poke and my hot sake carafe and bam!  one awesome 14 dollar treat!i'm also a big fan of their cocktails! every time i go in i like trying a new one off their creative menu  up till now my favorite has been the patron margarita  refreshing and the bartender phyllis (awesome at her job!) made it nice and sour for me  i'll keep adding to this review as i try more of their cocktails as well as other appetizers on the bar menu  but up till now i've been happy with my experience here! part of what makes my experience so fun every time is that without the staff  dennis and phyllis  two of the bartenders are super easy to talk to and go out of their way to provide exceptional service  eric and alan are also lots of fun to talk to when they're not super busy running around (which will likely be the case since this place is pretty popular!)  the staff is definitely why this place is a 5 5 to me and i hope to keep seeing this place staffed by lovely individuals as long as it's around  )food・addicting cabbage  actually addicting  don't believe me? try it and see!・spicy tuna poke  sadly as is the case with spicy fish  the wonderful tones of the raw fish become muddled  depending on the chef the presentation varies a lot  too ・fried chicken (karaage)  not bad  though also not the best i've had  the sauce helps though!・seaweed salad  love this one!・edamame  edamame  (for me that's a good thing lol)・sukiyaki beef bibimbap  filling  but aside from that  it doesn't really stand out in terms of flavor ・hakusai kimchi  pretty standard kimchi  which again  for me is a good thing spicy tuna volcano  looked cool  tasted a bit bland steamed chili shrimp dumplings  pretty standard as far as dumplings go  not nearly as spicy as they might look overall  if you're here for food  i'd recommend sitting at a table as opposed to at the bar  remember  there is no yakiniku at the bar due to the fact that the grills are only at the regular tables  cocktails・patron margarita  patron silver  triple sec  lime  i went with the classic flavor option and was not disappointed  one of my faves from gyukaku ・geisha girl  vodka  malibu  peach pucker  orange  easy to drink  leaning more towards the sweet side but not too sweet ・tokyo tea  vodka  rum  gin  tequila  midori (melon liquor)  triple sec  sour  sprite  i liked it  but not enough to order it over the margarita or mojito  def packs a punch!・forbidden punch  captain morgan's  pomegranate  grenadine  apple pucker  orange  pineapple  way too sweet for me  but if you've got a sweet tooth you'll probably enjoy it  kinda tasted like kool aid lol・bombay martini  bombay  dry vermouth  channeling my inner 007  got mine shaken  not stirred lol! the strongest drink i've had from this place  not for the faint of heart ・mango mai tai  white rum  dark rum  triple sec  pineapple  mango purée  yummy  but a bit too sweet for my tastes ・mojito  so goodpoint  during happy hour  all cocktails fall within the $5 dollar range  score!
our waiter  wen  was the highlight of our meal  he was always checking up on our table  making sure our waters were filled  and was super friendly  we had happy hour drinks and ordered a la carte  our favorites were the harami miso steak and the chicken thighs  the spicy tuna volcanos were awesome as well  i'll definitely be back to this location! it is smaller than the ones in the city  so if you have a large group  try to make a reservation 
dammmmmmmmn  this place is the bees knees and then some  actually feels like you're in manhattan and not in flushing  the plave is tucked away across from starbucks so it can be easy to miss but you'll know once you climb the stairs and get that smell of sweet sweet barbeque started off with drinks at the bar before our 9pm reservation (and definitely get some for weekends   the place was packed)  it's happy hour from 9 to midnight so our cocktails were $5  strong and um   cheap then it was meal time  the menu is extensive and could be intimidating  but our server was kind enough to explain everything  definitely recommend getting one of the set menus or going a la carte  we opted for picking all the items separately and pretty much dish was a hit  appetizers   spicy tuna volcano  cucumber  seaweed saladentrees   shio ramen  beef sukiyaki bibimbapmeat   kobe  kalbi  garlic beef  pork + assorted veggiesdefinitely come hungry and be ready to eat like royalty  for the gf and i  this feast came out to $80 total and it felt like a steal  want to keep this place our little secret but that'd just be greedy  definitely coming back!
one day as i was going home from main st and waiting for my bus  i looked up and there i saw the letters  gyu kaku  i was overjoyed at the thought that japanese bbq specialist gyu kaku was opening because i know they're good as of this review  they are only in soft opening mode meaning they take reservations only  if you walk in  it'll be hard to get a seat since there everything is made to grill table side  there isn't much leeway for those without reservations  since it was a family dinner and a first time  we decided to go for the pre set "gyu kaku" set with five starters & sides  six bbq items  and s'mores for dessert  the fried shrimp dumplings had a a beautiful golden crispy exterior and the shrimp inside was seasoned well  the gyu kaku salad is refreshing with a sweet tangy dressing which works with the bitterness of the salad greens and cherry tomatoes  for the bbq items  come in two batches  or that's what is supposed to happened  we received four at once  the bistro hanger steak miso  garlic shoyu rib eye  premium sirloin garlic  and new york steak strip garlic  out of those four  the standout is the bistro hanger steak miso with the perfect amount of meat to fat ratio and umami packed  combine it with the any of the three sauces available  sweet soy  ponzu (my favorite!)  or spicy plus rice and that really makes a sensational bite worth having again and again unfortunately  there were some service issues  our table was cleared about after we grilled the first four bbq items  what we realized after that was that we did not get the last two items and the miso soup for the sides  so we had to reset  our server was a bit frazzled and apologized for the problems  due to that we actually got the s'mores for free and because my mom really wanted the xango fried banana cheesecake with ice cream  we also got that as a complementary item  the manager also apologized at the end of the meal for the delay time between the bbq items as a former ktv bar  you can see the layout of how it was then but they've done great job with making the space look like a signature gyu kaku with the medium dark wood and grill tables  aside from service kinks that will hopefully be resolved  gyu kaku flushing is a great addition to the neighborhood  happy eating and remember  don't deny  satisfy!
amazing!!!!!! seriously ! i had a good time and the food was great because i cooked it to my liking ! very hospitable & the manager makes you feel special  came to our table and made sure we were enjoying ourselves  our waiter was great and very attentive  the drinks were great  the music was great & the overall vibe was very cool  definitely will come back & would recommend other people as well  for it only opening in june of 2017 the business is running great !
the best beef bbq in flushing but slow service   you need to have a reservation otherwise the wait is long for buffet

this place was great we got the gyu kaku for two  lots of food  tasted great   happy hour was fun 
had a friend's birthday dinner here recently  the servers and bartenders were knowledgeable  fun and friendly  the happy hour is great for cheap drinks  the food is outstanding! we didn't want to stop eating  overall  we all really really enjoyed everything and look forward to returning soon 
love this spot!it is on the pricey side  but it's definitely worth the money  the ingredients are definitely very fresh my boyfriend and i came here twice and we always order one of the sets  because it's definitely much more worth it the place is nice and clean  i would say it would be best to make a reservation  just in case because they don't really have a lot of tables  so to insure that you get a table soon and not have to wait a long time make a reservation the waiters and waitresses there are very kind and helpful  they are amazing and gives great customer service 
i had dinner tonight at gyu kaku  it was awesome!! from the moment we walked in the door  everyone was just so pleasant  it was actually slightly strange for me  some servers even bowed as we walked past  it was totally different then experiences i've previously had in restaurants in flushing  specifically   the server danny was great my friend and i got a wide variety of things  steak  salmon  scallops  shrimp  fried rice  dumplings  everything was super good and fresh  i would comment that portions aren't the biggest  the dumplings came 3 to an order  the shrimp and scallops came 4 to an order for $9 95 each  i  would need to order quite a few of everything to get full  although prices don't seem terrible everything does add up they have happy hour every day from 9pm to close! that's incredible  there were a whole bunch of things that were included in happy hour as well  in summary  i'll be back soon   )
best japanese bbq i ever have   i went with my wife for dinner   service super nice and friendly   food come out fast   super tasty food too   we will be back
maybe if service is better the next time  i'll raise the stars food wise no doubt is great! especially the kobe variety steak are definitely worth those high dollar amounts  the chicken garlic noodles were mad salty but good texture and flavors  spicy tuna volcano were actually delicious! they really fried the outer layer (rice) to super crisp! spicy ahi tuna poke were fresh and nicely flavored  just a bit little for $8 95  everything else on the premium package is nice but the shrimp garlic is just bland shrimp   our server didn't bring our water until we were super thirsty from eating the food (asked multiple times for water beforehand)  we waited for awhile every time for the grill plate to be changed  there was stuff in my water    but the s'mores in the package helped at the end our server seemed like he never serve before or at least with very little experience  i could tell since i was in the business for over 4 years  a busy place like this should hire experienced servers or at least train them well before putting them out to serve multiple tables during peak hours 
i'm in love with the coco! their mixed drink  coco mo that is! couldn't stop ordering these! their lychee bellini and tokyo tea were pretty good too  service was excellent   the servers were super attentive and changed our grills as soon as a layer of char was on them   every time they placed new meats on our tables  they told us how to grill them and for how long for best taste   food was great!  all the meats were fresh and delicious   marinated perfectly   did i mention the coco mo yet? haha  i'll definitely be coming back 
excellent service every time i've been here  i love the quality of the meats they offer  as well as the very reasonable prices  the mega mug of sapporo has to be my favorite thing available as well as the toro beef  which is basically make your own bacon  has to be one of my favorite asian food restaurants in new york 
the bar area is pretty small but service is fast  make sure you make a reservations for the dining area because it is pretty small as well (compared to the cooper location) and it gets pretty busy  the service for the tables is fast and good  didn't get to try the bbq here but the drinks here are good and the cooked foods are as well  can't go wrong here 
i came here on a friday night with a party of 6 and we got the meat lover's which is premade set for 6 people  the beef cuts were definitely the highlight of the course and the lesser favorites were the pork and chicken  service was good  especially on a busy evening  our server was pretty cool and informative on happy hours that they had later at night  after buying a couple of drinks  the bill ended up coming out to about $50 per person which is a bit on the pricier side  but overall food  service  and and experience was positive 
i don't know why  but this is really my go to japanese bbq jam  i'm a big fan of the east village location  but i have gone to times square several times  east village has such a good crowd of workers  super chill  times square is almost always packed  filled with working individuals and even with reservations  you may have to wait a while to get seated  the attention over at times square is not as good as the one in the village  happy hour is always the best time to go  but for a difference of a few dollars  it's just a few extra plates of meat  a lot of times  the meats that i love are not even on the happy hour menu  so it's really going for the drinks  the best happy hour item is probably the booze   a bottle of plum wine please !they have the mobile app now where they offer you some specials  i have probably redeemed way too many discounted meals because of this (not a bad thing of course)  refer friends and get bonus points towards your meal where you can redeem for plates of food or $25 off your meal  feel free to use my gyu app referral code  cindyung7630
the salad is medium size bowl and taste very good  not too much dressing  tofu is very soft to eat   beef ave other meats are premium and takes 45 seconds to cook
damn good all you can eat japanese bbq came in and did three all you can eat option for $35 and wasn't disappointed  eric was a great waiter and helped us make sure we knew what we were doing and how to cook the meat properly don't miss out on the toro beef 
from the second yu walk through the door the service starts! with greetings  menus instructions choices the service was top notch! our server was 'palm'super nice guy  gave us reccomendations  took pictures for us  our group was 8 and we celebrated our friends birthday! it was truly a blast! cant eait to go back with  y family  so they too can enjoy a wonderful experience with food!
i was really excited about this place especially since i've been to the one in california i must say i was very happy with the service closest was a sweetheart and our waiter was a gentleman extremely attentive   the kalbi on the grill was amazing!!!! and the chicken noodles look like it was handmade but i forgot to ask and tasted awesome  deafly coming back here again
i took my girlfriend here for her birthday and i couldn't have found such a gem   the service is phenomenal   with it being our first time here out waitress made us feel right at home   she was really patient with us   she went over the specials   recommended some items and made it real easy to order   the food came out fast and out was delicious   i will deff will be coming back here in the near future
i love the food and the waiter was super nice  it was most of our group first time here so we weren't sure on what to get and was taking a while picking everything out  the waiter make jokes and was patience through the whole process 
i've been to a gyu kaku in the city and remember enjoying the experience there  i came to this location in flushing with a friend who i haven't seen in over a year and wanted to catch up  the food was okay  the seasoned meats  seafood all tasted similar and some lacked flavor  my favorite was honestly the corn  the service was overbearing and our conversation was interrupted multiple times  i understand new establishments want feedback from their customers but please let your customers enjoy their dinner and give them some room to breathe 
we always come for the happy hour  every night from 9 to close drinks are half price and the food is discounted as well  the food is pretty good though you will not be blown out of the water we usually get the happy hour special and between the two of us we tend to have left overs  you can add in certain dishes (i usually throw in extra veggies)  the special comes with some appetizers like dumplings  bacon rinds and a salad  the meats come out and you get a selection of about 5 6 between beef  pork and chicken  the meat is marinaded before it is brough to you and everything we have tried so far has been great (especially the pork belly)  the best part about this place is you leave no smelling like you sat in a smoker for hours  their grills sucktion all the smoke out  which is a nice change from other bbq places at the end we always get s'mores  tho by that time i have had too much food and have no space  great dinner place if you are out late in the area 
i came here for my birthday and the staff were really nice to me and my friends  they really know how to have fun and the food was amazing  it's really expensive though so unless you have lots of spare money in your wallet try to save before coming 
was here for dinner on a thursday night  not too busy  very good service and nice atmosphere  one of the more nicer restaurants in flushing 
this place has amazing customer service  i had a good time cooking my shrimp  scallops and veggies  i had the garlic fried rice  shrimp dumplings and fried calamari    everything delicious! this is a great restaurant for dates as well as for families 
came here with a friend to try this new place out! i only have two complaints  first  the lighting is so dim that its very hard to see if the meat is fully cooked or not  second  the host that seated us was mumbling  i didnt understand one word he was saying  food is great  but  i will stick to kbqq instead because of the free side dishes they offer 
this restaurant is open in flushing and finally give myself and my friend a try  the food quaility is good  but the service is not  first  out service is very rush to take our order and without even explaining anything and after drop off the water  when we request the more sauce for the beef  he seems rolling his eyes and unwilling  this is not a good sign for service  i know maybe they have a lot of rude people dine in this location  but please be nice to everyone  i will def not coming back  better go to the one in the city 
when i heard gyu kaku opened up a location flushing i was ecstatic! i frequent gyu kaku times square but having a location much closer to me meant i could satisfy my cravings without having to leave queens  i reserved a table for two the day before and arrived 5 minutes early  it's really easy to miss the entrance and once you walk up the stairs you're greeted by a narrow walkway with the bathroom on one side and the hostess stand at the end of the walkway  we waited a good 5 minutes before anyone came downstairs to acknowledge our existence and then were told to wait another 10 15 minutes while they prepared a table for us  i thought the idea or reserving a table was so that i could be seated when i got there  guess not  one star off  the upstairs space itself is much smaller than other gyu kaku locations and tables were pretty close to each other but it didn't really affect the dining experience  their lunch menu and happy hour pricing are pretty similar to other locations but the portions were slightly smaller than other locations  another star off  we ordered a bit too much food and had to take it to go   we ended up having to ask 3 different people for a to go container 3 times each  overall quality of the food is good  portion sizes are a bit off  staff was a bit scattered but there's room for improvement  i'll be back  and hopefully it'll match my experience at their other locations in the city 
my fiance and i came here about a month ago  we came around 9pm to try to participate in happy hour! we waited about an hour  seated around 10pm   we ordered 3 veggie dishes and about 5 meat dishes  and smores for dessert  we got some drinks  they were pretty strong  we paid about 50 dollars pp  smores was a great finisher to the meal  the service was above par 
i went this past sunday and the food was amazing!!! so delish  i never knew that there was japanese bbq and was so pleasantly surprised  they opened just a few months ago and even better thats its in queens  awesome  it was recommended to the fam  so we came  very nice decor and all staff were super attentive and friendly  the waitress kay was very nice  it was our first time at the restaurant so a quick description was given on how it is  thankful for that  we arrived around 4 30pm and it was happy hour for food and drinks until 6pm  score  my party ordered apps  entrees and drinks  for drinks  we ordered a bottle of sake  a margarita and a lycheetini  drinks were great  we ordered fried shrimp dumplings and fried calamari for apps  they were so delicious and crispy  we loved it  if you follow gyu kaku on facebook or instagram  you get a free order of edamame  just show the waitress and your order of edamame is on its way  as for our entree selection  we ordered filet mignon  skirt steak  garlic shrimp  scallops  zucchini  brocolli  beef bimipbab and garlic rice  the waitress told us how many minutes each item took on the grill  now time to bbq on the mini grill in the middle of the table  i was the cook for the night haha  no problem  each table had a pair of tongs for each person in the party which was great  the flavor on the meat was delish  the veggies were oh so delish both grilled and steamed  as for the rice  both orders came in cast iron bowls steaming and the waiters would mix the rice and portion it for you  very nice  we made the beef bimipbab very spicy  wow that was so delicious  as for the garlic rice  my party had to add some sauces to liven the flavor  after the meat was cooked  i went on to cook the seafood  it was so delicious  the shrimp and scallops so yummy  so we were lacking some more meat and we ordered an extra order of filet mignon and to add to it another order of the beef bimipbab  so good and we were so full  no room for more  another tidbit that the waiter gave us is that if you get the app and sign up  you can receive rewards for every purchase and able to redeem them for free food and a discount on your next visit  double score  once you sign up you scan the receipt and there you go  rewards  i could have received smores  which is a popular item  but my party was so full  definitely next time making room for dessert  i had a great time  lovely decor and the staff wow  i am definitely going back and now that i know they have a location in cali i am so there 
we had lunch special bbq which includes salad  miso soup  rice and two choices of meats for 10 99   some meats choices cost two or three dollars extra   but i think it's still a good deal   they offer lunch special on weekday before 3pm   two of us tried kalbi  harami  hanger steak and yagi shabu beef  and our favorite were harami and hanger steak   there were three different kinds of bbq sauces on the table  but some of the meats marinaded well and adding sauce may be too salty   try them without sauce first 
we had a fun evening and the food was very good  if you order a la carte  you may risk your entire order coming down at once  good to communicate in order not to have multiple dishes in front of you 
this is one of my favorite korean bbq restaurant   while it is pricey $$$  it is worth it  while i frequent the midtown manhattan location most of the time  the flushing location did not disappoint  it is located on the second floor of a building   the entrance is on a side street   not main street   the receptionist was friendly and professional   the bar area is very small  as well   all in all the entire place is a bit small for my taste but the food and especially staff more than made up for the discomfort of the seating area   we chose the $130 group menu for 4 and added 2 avocado( $7) salads with our meal   everything on the menu  with a few exceptions  was delightful   the server will bring out your menu items and turn the burner on for you to cook the meat   you are provided with three choice of sauce; tangy   sweet and spicy  there is sea salt available but you must ask for it   all of the meats were fresh and tender   i especially enjoyed the kolbi steak which was super tender and mouth watering   the miso soup was very bland and the duck was not to my liking   it had a gammy taste to it   to drink i ordered a ginger ale (free refills)  and for dessert i had the crepe and vanilla ice cream ($12)(the menu included smores for dessert)    the crepes were light and fluffy and the ice cream was a perfect companion  the only cons are the decor   small space and parking   we parked on prince street and paid $12 for two hours   there is a parking garage on main street for $1 less   make sure to make a reservation as far in advance as possible   they like all the other locations fill up quickly   special shout out to danny one of the best waiters i've had   he was professional  courteous  quick and very pleasant!
i have been to the cooper square location and had a great experience  so my girlfriend and i decided to give this location a try  we made reservations and we got seated true to our reservation  our waiter  eric  was very attentive throughout our meal up until all the meat was grilled  we ordered the premium meal for two  which came with dessert  we never got our dessert and when i tried to find eric to get the bill  he was busy waiting his other table  i get that it just turned happy hour  but he did not come check up on us once for 30 minutes  we had to wave down another waiter to get our bill  and that took another 15 minutes  if not for another waiter  jeremy  apologizing profusely  i would've given this location a lower rating  oh   and we were promised that our dessert was coming  but that didn't happen    
amazing food  and great service  our server taught us how to properly cook our meat and both managers even did table touches and one of them even sang happy birthday to me  and it wasn't one of those fake birthday songs that people dread to do  this was an actual cheerful birthday song  everyone was actually smiling and seemed so into  great service and great staff  deff would be coming here again 
came here for happy hour with a party of 10 for a friend's birthday  i already made reservations so the seating process was quick and easy  my girlfriend and i got the $70 premium set and our whole table got around ~8 sapporo pitchers ($14 during hh)  i've been here many times and the meat is always so fresh  flavorful  and delicious  the beer draft is also very refreshing and compliments the meats very well  definitely recommend coming here during happy hour for the food or just drinks!after we left the restaurant  we realized that the waiter charged my order incorrectly for the premium set; they charged each item separately (the rest of the table's check was correct)  i called the restaurant the next morning and explained to the manager what was incorrect and he offered me back the difference and cash and an extra gift card on top for the inconvenience 
absolutely delicious  went on short notice and had no problems getting a reservation  parking in the area is a little difficult but nothing unexpected for ny   hostess was fast and friendly getting us to our table and the service was great  eric was our server and he did an outstanding job of explaining the menu and the way the restaurant works  we ordered the meat lovers and it was a ton of food for 2 people   this will be a regular stop on my trips to ny 
i don't understand all the rave reviews  we came here on a saturday night and were so disappointed by the experience! you can barely see the meat you are cooking because it's so dark and it too forever for our meat to arrive  they give you very small portions of meat! my poor kid got very sick after eating from here  she had a stomach ache the whole night after dinner and vomited three times the day after  never again will i come to this place 
great place!! i would totally recommend to anyone looking for a self grill restaurant  the service was impeccable changing the grill after every round of food made to help prevent burning  the meat was fresh  delicious and so easy to cook  there were very clear instructions and if you ever had a question they would come right away  although this place is a little expensive they have many deals and a reward system with points  i would 1000% recommend this restaurant 
it was my cousin's last night in ny so dinner was a must   it was a saturday night so i knew it would be busy  i made reservations at 9 45pm  the food and drinks were amazing and well priced  learned they have happy hour everyday even the weekends which is alway a plus   the waiter we had the pleasure of having named alan was great   he was very energetic and had great recommendations  he was very detailed oriented describing how to cook different meats which i learned through experience make a difference  monday through thursday all you can eat for $35  yup i'll be back!!
i've been here many times and the service and food has always been wonderful  my favorites are the shishuto peppers  fried bacon chips  and sukiyaki bibimbop  gyukaku has not once disappointed me and i will continue coming here  love you gyukaku 
i go almost every week dude  mostly on weekdays around 9 00 pm for the happy hour dealx   japanese bbq  sake and beer     can't go wrong 
i was so excited when flushing gyu kaku opened because i loveeee gyu kaku! however food  significantly smaller portions & less flavorful  prices are definitely more expensive compared to manhattan locations  was really disappointed  in terms of my favorite  sukiyaki bibimbap    definitely not even comparable to the manhattan locations  doesn't taste the same  the texture is so different  the spicy tuna volcano is also not as good  service  this is why i still gave them 3 stars  excellent service from our servers  very attentive& provided a very energetic environment which made my dining experience great  however  would prefer a little less energy so my dining session isn't interrupted by "do you need something?" overall  6 10 would come back again
good japanese bbq  servers are nice  the hostess was nice  meat is fresh  good quality
omg finally flushing has a place serving quality food! i've been to guy kaku in the city before but definitely didn't receive the same hospitality that i received tonight here at the flushing location  our server eric was so kind and wonderful  the food is mind blowing as usual  the environment is very chilled and music is amazing  it's a great place for group events  as well as date nights!
we spotted this location a few weeks ago and it got me all excited! i've never been to gyu kakus in the city but i've loved dining at locations in socal  i called and inquired about reservations around 6 pm on father's day and was told the earliest reservation they had was 9 15 pm with a 9 30 pm last call and a 10 pm closing  my husband said to go for it so we did we're still not very familiar with the area so i looked up parking ahead of time  we knew that from before  it's mostly parallel parking with heavy pedestrian traffic  my husband would rather pay to park in a lot and be done with it than search for cheaper street parking  the closest lot i found was on 136 18 41st ave this location is located on the second floor; i didn't see any elevators  you come to an initial landing where the hostess' podium and restrooms are  then up another flight of stairs to where the bar and main dining areas are situated  the hostesses offered for us to sit at the bar while we waited since we arrived early  the lychee tini  mango lemonade  and asahi were on point  you could order food at the bar as well but we opted out service everywhere was great  including from our server chris  he knew the menu well  which is great when you have a particular husband and a kid with tons of food allergies  we requested plain chicken for my daughter and when it came out sprinkled with sesame seeds (she's allergic)  they were quick to apologize and fix it right away  we initially ordered the mixed veggies for our daughter assuming they'd be plain  but they'd all been marinated in shoyu (she has a wheat allergy as well) so we just ate them ourselves  pretty much all of the meat is marinated so if you have a wheat allergy  i'd say you'll probably have a bland time  we also ordered the french fries  husband wasn't a fan of the dipping sauce it came with  i liked it   reminded me a little of kewpie mayo  the bowls of plain rice were more generous than i thought  one would've been enough to split between me and our kid  we got our first order of food around 9 37 pm so i was worried about missing last call already  but chris reassured us that it wouldn't be a problem ordering more food again soon  my daughter has a beef allergy as well (i know  i know   eating out with us is so fun)  we try to stay away from places where you grill your own meat because ventilation is poor sometimes and her eczema flares up; however  we had absolutely no problems at this particular gyu kaku  her skin didn't get worse  everything had been wiped down clean  and us parents enjoyed a nice dinner my husband's only gripe is that he can probably devour a whole cow by himself so the cost to serving size ratio hurts his feelings  he ordered a beef sukiyaki bibimbap to fill himself up  we downloaded the gyu kaku app for rewards points because we'll definitely be back 
i felt welcomed by their service  the waiters came to check on us pretty often  explained the menu clearly and honestly  we ordered kobe beef  beef tongues  multiple veggies  chicken  steak  etc  we also had rice and noodles for carbs  the food was very tender and juicy  and it tasted fresh  after the meal the manager showed up and greeted us  as customers  you will feel very valued there  thanks for the great service!
came here last night with a reservation for 2 at 7 30pm  since gyu kaku just opened  it was very busy  definitely make a reservation! once i checked in at the landing area  i was told that the table was finishing up and there was a little wait  i told them no worries  and my heavily pregnant friend sat down on the bench while we waited  shortly after  another hostess came over and ask my friend if we wanted to wait upstairs instead since it was cooler and she didn't want my friend to get jostled by the people waiting  once upstairs near the bar area  we were offered waters as we waited for our table to open up  we ordered a la carte instead of the combo deals because we wanted different things  below is a run down of our order    lychee lemonade   i'd pass  didn't taste like lychee at all  more like watered down lemonade    virgin lychee bellini   my friend said it just tasted like sprite   virgin mango mai tai   no mango taste    french fries with cod caviar sauce   fries were hot and crispy  we weren't big fans of the sauce  and they don't have ketchup   only hot sauce    pork sausage fried rice   a japanese take on dolsot bimbimbap? portion was generous  watch out though  we didn't realized but this is a spicy dish    kobe style kalbi short rib   good  but our portion seemed a bit cartilage y  like it was tougher than usual    harami miso skirt steak   good flavor  we would get again    kalbi short rib (regular)   we had this after the kobe style so we didn't think it was as good  good if you don't want to pay double the price for kobe style    japanese pork sausage   just okay  we were expecting it to be more like the ones from the skewers cart  but it was leaner and saltier  comes with a side of mustard for dipping   miso cod fish   delicious  but i accidentally cooked it too long  comes with a mushroom in it too   corn   the garlic y butter sauce is so good! we kept dipping our fries in the sauce afterwards  it comes in tin ramekins and you cook it by putting it on the grill until the butter starts to bubble  the corn is more like korean corn  which is chewier than american sweet corn   garlic button mushrooms   good  pretty generic  the mushrooms are salt and peppered before wrapped in foil  for the cons  the day we went  we were seated next to a big family with two very loud kids who kept screaming  yelling  and playing for much of our meal  we couldn't really hear ourselves talk because the kids were so loud and out of control  sad part is the adults didn't do anything to calm them down  our waitress was also super nice  but a little forgetful which we understand because it was a full house  we had to hunt down a couple of servers for waters which didn't come until halfway through the meal and they forgot to give us bowls for the rice  overall  it was a good experience and i would go back again  only wish that they had the happy hour specials that their manhattan locations have 
got a seat for two on a crowded saturday night after a long wait (~40min) and a decent mai tai from the bar  we ordered two specials  the miso in love and the shrimp and mushroom  as well as some galbi  the shrimp and mushroom came on a small pan that you put on the grill  and it tasted great  with an italian style due to the olive oil and pesto  the miso in love had 3 different meats  of which the thinner one was the best  the rest of the meat was okay  but the marinade didn't really sink in as much because the meats were thicker  service was great though  and they would switch off the grill grate almost every time we cooked a set of meats  would definitely go back again at a less crowded time  but only for the thinner meats specials 
shoutout to charles  ian  phyllis  and waan for making this a great night!recommendations  fries w  cod caviar  garlic shrimp  garlic noodles  ribeye  and yaki shabu beef  like their page on facebook for free edamame!disclaimer  i'm still coming down from the high of knowing this is finally open  so please excuse the over the top excitement & super long review  i called on a whim to check if they were open and huzzah! opening for 4 for 8pm on the same day  a miracle (especially when i walked in and realized just how long the wait was for walk ins) i am so  so thrilled that gyukaku flushing has finally opened  i'm a regular at gyukaku cooper square (so much so that the bartenders recognize me  oh dear)  and now that i've moved away from the city  gyukaku tops the list of things i miss about living in east village  i'll start with the bad  i'm going to chalk this up to the soft opening struggles  but portions were markedly smaller for the prepared  cooked food (appetizers and noodles)  this was very noticeable in the garlic noodles  spicy tuna volcano  and fries w  cod caviar  the noodles and fries were fully half of the portion i'm used to  and the volcano was missing about half the usual amount of spicy tuna  that said  it is their soft opening  and they were super  super crowded  if they were a little short on ingredients i can understand  same goes for the time it took to bring out the food  did i mention they were really crowded?now for the good  the food! everything was delicious  despite the smaller portions for prepared cooked food  the rice in the volcano was crispy and perfectly cooked  and the meats were well marinated and seasoned  the managers charles and ian were running around like chickens with their heads cut off  but they still found time to check in and make sure i knew to let them know once my full party arrived  phyllis  you make a mean villagers iced tea! waan  our server  was very sweet and changed our grill often  all in all  i had a great time! my recommendations are above  and i look forward to coming back  ( 
very excited for this place because it's close to home  this place is amazing! we ordered meat lovers for 6 people  it was more than enough  their fried calamari is better than other places i've tried because it's easy to chew  unlike kbbq  you cook the meat yourself  they have a grill guide to show you how many mins you should cook it  their meat & shrimp are super fresh and delicious  they have a very friendly staff & made sure to change your grill whenever necessary  their combos usually comes with s'mores but you should also try their desserts  out of their desserts  their mochi is the best  it comes with thai tea  strawberry  vanilla & matcha flavor  their lava ice cream and fried banana ice cream were also good too  the fried banana ice cream was very crispy  will def come back!
amazing! everything from the food  drinks  atmosphere  to the hospitality is amazing  a friend introduced me a few months ago and i'm starting to feel like a regular   i visit during their late happy hour after 9pm where some food items are discounted and all drinks  cocktails  beer  wine  hard liquor  sake  etc  are half off  i sometimes call for a reservation but never end up needing one  the longest wait has been maybe 15 minutes  ironically  i don't eat red meat but there are great poultry  seafood  vegetable  and appetizer alternatives  there hasn't been one thing on the menu  bbq item or "ready to eat" that i haven't found delicious  they're very meticulous in changing the grill and making sure the fire is low or off when not being used the music is trendy and on point and the cocktails have a good ratio of alcohol  speaking of which i actually sent the forbidden punch back for being too sweet  i rarely send items back and dread the explanation part but the manager was extremely understanding  he apologized and without hesitation asked what i'd like in its place; i was stunned  so here are my recommendations and tips for an even better time at gyu  happy hour is all day at the bar  that includes the bar menu for food and you can order dessert here (not the s'mores)  the shrimp garlic is a bestseller for a reason and you can't go wrong with it  the spicy tuna volcano is great and so is the chicken garlic noodles  my go to drink is the mango mai tai  download their app  rack up points and claim free food  an incentive that made me come back more often than i thought i would 
first of all service here is not only amazing  its very quick  our server eric didnt feel like a server the whole time  he felt like a friend thats how great he was  quality of food is excellent and its hard to find a meat that was below delicious  definitely coming back seeing how great the experience was 
love love love this place  the cuts if the meat are so good  quality meat  both times i've gone  i've been seated at the front but it looks huge and has many seatings  this place is fun for groups or a nice date  also download their app and get in on their point redemption system  you can get free items or dessert!
my boyfriend and i were recommended to try this place and loved it  we sat by the bar with the nicest bartender  philys  she was so helpful and entertaining  we took advantage of the bar special with two appetizers and a sapporo beer dinner we were in a rush to finish our shopping trip   we are making plans to return and trying out the bbq selection   for appetizer we recommend the dumplings  calamari and the salmon volcano 
they do not honor reservations  food is good but not 30 minutes over on top of a reservation  just get rid of reservations if it cannot be fulfilled 
happy hour with phyllis is awesome   great sweet bartender who looks you out even moments after last call  lost of fun best calamari 
after coming here for the first time tonight i must say   out of all the nyc locations (except for white plains which i just found about lol) this is my favorite location so far! (sorry midtown)  the servers were all super nice especially koyo (sorry if i butchered your name)  everybody was on point with clearing of the tables  taking orders  explaining how to cook the food and just great customer service  also loved the ambiance  the music was great usually they play elevator music in other gyukakus with the exception of the times square location that is too loud for my taste  the bartenders did a great job because i've been drinking gyukaku lychee tinis for years (see my prior yelp reviews) and this lychee tini was the best one i've tasted yet! it was perfect  eric was great too! very friendly! the manager at one point came and poured us water which i thought was great  it shows its a team effort  i also loved that they had the all you can eat option  i hope that sticks around  i will definitely come back here and recommend this location  so happy i now have one close to home and i don't have to travel to the city  i had a great night!
location   3 5 the entrance wasn't exactly easy to find and there are stairs when you walk in  the place in general was pretty small and dim  food   4 5 we went during happy hour but too be frank the pricing isn't that much different if you don't go during that time  it's maybe 2 3 dollars more    because it is a diy grill the quality of the food is moreover in your control  for the most part the quality in the food was great  but for a 2 person serving it didn't really get us full  service 3 5   everyone was very polite and explained how long to cook everything  however i wished they came in to check in on us more frequently and offered us water from the beginning or refilled our drinks when it was running low  if you live nearby and crave bbq you could come here  but parking is still as difficult to find in other locations and expect to order more even with the combos 
had so much fun here  our server danny was very nice and informative  everyone was friendly and attentive never had an issue getting a waiter over for anything  food was good with the exception of one meat we ordered that was very chewy  (don't remember the name)  over all everything was great! would return  also it's in a very convenient location 
came to this location for the first time  i usually go to midtown  let me tell you    i've been missing out! this location is way better  the staff is amazing! everyone is so friendly and helpful  the restaurant is so clean  the manager denise is beyond nice  they welcome you when you come in and everyone says have a nice day when you leave  the food is amazing and they have a all you can eat option for $35 a person!! can't get any better than that  love love love  must go back 
it's been a long time since i've had service as good as we had at gyu kaku  rating is attributed mostly to that  though food was very good  overall  we came here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner  on a tuesday night around 5 00 p m   were sat right away and seated in a nice cozy booth meant for four  we've been to a table grill restaurant before in flushing  but this was by far the most clean and upscale we've found to date  the booths are spacious and situated with ample space from other booths  so for a new york location  it feels almost luxurious  we ordered right away and for those that order the all you can eat menu there is **one very important point to consider  you will be charged extra if you don't finish all the food you order ** this was a bit confusing for us in the beginning as we thought when our server amy explained the guidelines  we thought she was giving us the normal all you can eat spiel (you can't take home what you don't eat)  but we somehow missed the point that you will be charged for food you order  but don't eat  jackie  our server who took over  explained this to us when we had several slices of meat still left to be grilled when we asked for our check  so  just be advised  if you order all you can eat  you will be charged for the food you order  but don't cook    so make sure you gauge your hunger before you order that last round of food  the caveat to this is you won't be charged for the cooked food you might leave on your plate  this is all to discourage food waste for very nice cuts of meat  among other reasons  (all these details are printed on the menu in small print on the page preceding the all you can eat choices )food  we ordered the ultimate all you can eat menu and weren't disappointed  for our appetizer we ordered the spicy tuna volcano    not bad  the tuna could have used a bit more seasoning (it was kind of bland)  but overall it was good  we also ordered the japanese fried chicken  perhaps a bit too dry for us  but the dipping sauce made up for it  and the steamed chili shrimp dumplings  which were good standard dumplings  for the main course our favorites were the filet mignon ponzu  bistro hangar steak miso  new york strip steak  harami miso skirt steak and angus beef rips sweet soy  we also got the pork belly  both to grill (pork belly white soy) and over rice (chashu bowl)  neither of which were particularly noteworthy  i also feel like the sauce choices on the table were good  ponzu  soy and spicy sweet  but that there is the possibility for a more delectable  perhaps house made dipping sauce that could be added  something savory like a combo made from soy  sesame oil  vinegar  garlic and ginger that would be easy to make in the kitchen would be a great addition  service  service here hands down was absolutely review worthy  jackie  our server for the majority of the evening was everything you would want in someone helping you enjoy your dining experience  for starters  he was incredibly attentive  one of the things i like is when a server squats down when talking to a table so that they inhabit the same seating level as their guests    and when jackie made that small gesture  it was just one small thing among many he did that showed his care and interest in making sure we got the best service  he always made sure to change our grill top after each round of cooking  he had recommendations to offer  was always good about instructing us cooking times and meat placement on the grill  and never let our drinks completely finish before asking if we needed a refill  one of the sweetest gestures    and the mark of really skilled server    was when he read my mind  i casually brought up it was my boyfriend's birthday  but i never asked for a dessert or for any special recognition  right before our check came out  a group of the serving team  lead by jackie  came out with ice cream topped with a candle singing happy birthday gyu kaku style  it was such a charming thing to do  and really won us over  denis  the manager even managed to stop by during the course of our meal to ask us about our dinner and somehow seemed to sense we were first timers and made us feel incredibly welcome and like our presence there was genuinely appreciated  all in all  we will definitely be back    their app and customer loyalty system definitely capitalizes on the feel good experience the restaurant provides    and when a free appetizer is offered  there's little reason not to come back!
the food was excellent and the drinks were so  so good    but the customer service was even better  a friend and i went here for dinner saturday night  it was freezing outside  so her battery died  we sat in her car for over an hour trying to reach aaa and even trying to get help from people nearby  no one cared  i went back inside the restaurant and spoke to dennis wu (an employee)  dennis managed to contact another employee  jackie chen  to leave his apartment and help jump start our car neither of them didn't have to help  yet they did  people like them often restore my faith in nyc so if you're in the area  gyu kaku is the place to go 
two busy eating to take photos   we did not have a reservation and was super sad when we were told we won't be able to be accommodated tonight  we saw a lot of walk in costumers being turn away  luckily someone called to cancel and we were able to be seated and serve!! we ordered a dinner set for 6 adults for three ladies and were so full afterwards everyone ended up walking home  the waiters were extremely nice and attentive  the food is great  expect the fried chicken is too salty for my taste  i can understand since it's their first month of operation  the waiter was extremely professional and told us they would work on the chicken  happy costumers  glad we made the trip to flushing for gyu kaku!
verrry good  they shout whenever new guests arrive or when the guests are done dining  almost like the ramen restaurant ipuddo  makes the whole experience feel more exciting and alive  the food was pretty good  especially the combo bbq package  it really fills you up since there are a variety of appetizers  entrees and dessert  11 10 would go for round two
the food here is extremely delicious   the volcano appetizers are amazing  not fishy at all  the meat is perfectly seasoned and the bonus is that you get to grill it as much or as as little as you desire   the rice with the egg is my favorite  ask for them to let the rice sit in the bowl for a bit  it's makes the rice a little crunchy in certain spots and gives it added flavor and texture  an added bonus  the waiters and waitresses are very attentive!
this is my first time going to gyu kaku in flushing i had a terrific time  i've been to a few other locations and they live up to the standard the others have in terms of quality of food and service  we made reservations and were seated promptly the server was quick and efficient  after the great food the manager checked on us which was greatly appreciated  i also work in restaurants so i have to give credit where it is due they have a very friendly staff  thanks will definitely be back!
great stuff and the happy hour is very well priced  hard to park but once that's all set  you are golden  food was great  happy hour special for the meat was great!wait staff was phenomenal 
truly appreciate the atmosphere of this restaurant though i ain't a bbq lover at all  i never expect the pork belly and steak burnt like the dry jerky then i paid around 40 bucks to leave 
this is most definitely one of my favorite bbq places! we did the premium all you can eat for 45 each  definitely worth  all the meats were quality and tasted amazing  service was 110%  our waiter eric took care of us so well! would definitely come back again 
all meats are great  ordered bestseller 1 and 2  beef tongue with scallion souce  and lamb chops  lamb chops lacks flavor but still very tender  spicy ramen is better than expected bibimbap rice was good  i wish there's some vegetables  and the rice crust was bit too hard to chew most importantly  the service at this new location in flushing is very nice  the waiter took time to explain the menu  how to cook the meat  busy but continued to check on us  and made very knowledgeable recommendations  the manager dennis also check on all the guests we are a party of 2  no reservation at 7pm on wednesday  waited about 5 minutes before seated overall  very nice experience and would definitely come back more 
i'm not 100% sure if it's because they just opened and the staff is fresh  but i'm usually a loyal cooper square guest where everyone knows my name and who always have my hot sake and mug of sapporo ready for me  the staff here at flushing is quite attentive  the space is much smaller than the nyc locations and its located on a second floor  try to make a reservation ahead of time on busier days like the weekends and if you're driving  make sure to give yourself enough time in advance because parking in this area is still a real pain in the ass  the menus are pretty much the same in all locations  i noticed that they stopped serving corn cobs with the veggies  and now serve what looks like canned corn in an aluminum tin  definitely not happy with this change  i'll always be a fan of this establishment  always a good time 
never went here but i heard it was popin  also a little expensive so i went to sleep and dreamt about eating here  the meat was fantastic  cant complain
i've been here for a couple times already  both for happy hour  so glad that they opened up in flushing  saved my commute to manhattan when i'm craved for gyu kaku  my favorite sauce is the sweet sauce  although most of the meat taste great without any additional sauce  but i'm so disappointed with my second visit  we had ordered 7 meats  first they brought 5 meats only then we told the server  he then bryout the other 2 meats  when we asked for the check  we were charged for 8 meats 
service 5 5   food taste 4 5 but very small portions  it was a friday when we went  we called to find out if there are seats because someone told me they have a long waiting if you don't reserve seats  and they told us there are seats but next booking comes in 1 5 hrs so we took the seats because we never eat that long anyways  food came fast  taste was alright nothing outstanding  the meat portions are very small  or very thin  we ordered 3 difference meat orders and some snacks and a rice and one drink each came out about $180 for 4 people not incl  tips  so its about $50   head   for big guys     you might need to order more  
garlic noodles are amazing! great staff and comfy atmosphere! meat was delicious and their special sauce went well with everything!
this spot is simply amazing for anyone with a hungry appetite and in a search for good food  their deal for unlimited korean bbq and hot pot is certainly a bargain  combined great quality ingredients  a price that didn't break the bank  and a stop button controlled only by your appetite  which are definitely ingredients to a great meal! the only thing i wish were a little better is the service  while the spot is quite large  they seem to have a waiting staff stretched kind of thin  and sometimes it was hard to get service  this wasn't a big deal and overall i would definitely recommend this spot!
came here with 5 friends and ordered the meat lover combo  it was very filling and had a variety of flavorful meat worthy to try  the process is essentially cooking the meat on our own  there were also various appetizers such as fried pork belly and spicy tuna volcano  the starters were miso soup and salad  both very good as well  a nice way to start a filling meal  the service was good  all the waiters were friendly and easy to talk to  they made jokes and were attentive  our server eric was especially open to us and welcoming  his service was great  made us feel very comfortable  jokes around with us and made the experience were fun and memorable  this was my second time here and my second experience here was a lot better than the the first namely because our server was great  the environment was very welcoming  especially with their opening welcome said in japanese  for dessert they had s'mores that we grilled ourselves  overall  this restaurant was great  would definitely come back 
i never thought paying to cook my own meals would be so good but the food was great and the service was even better   eric was very patient with this first timer and also very helpful in providing instruction   will definitely come back
the wait staff was very patient  friendly and helpful  while i admit our group was more than a bit loud and maybe a bit needy (all you can eat!  and we ate a lot   of everything   all in 90 minutes)  our servers were unflappably good humored and attentive  there's a large array of apps  proteins and sides to try  eventually went into a meat coma but we enjoyed ourselves immensely  there were just a few food items (intestine   too chewy and spicy pork too spicy) that we tried that we didn't like but we enjoyed pretty much everything else 
one of the best bbq places in this area  ingredients are freshly prepared  awesome customer service! great foood! and they sell lady m!! lit!!! love this place!
i come here before and not too busy time   i took my son and daughter with my brother family for a total of 7 people   price is ok but the good service and food are excellent   we had the tofu dead food soup and beef think slices   the staff is very attentive with smiles   i recommend the place highly 
really great staff here  we had about 5 different attendants and every one of them were so friendly  courteous  and professional  food was delicious and came out quickly  we were recommended to this place by my brother  can't wait to tell my friends about this place!
nice interior design and friendly staff  awesome place for family friend gathering  recommend "meat lovers" to big group  decent starters  great bbq meat  fresh seafood  s'more and mochi ice cream are a must  will go again on birthday
been here before when they opened  good food but small place  this time we had an online reservation but they didn't honor the time slot  made a 7 45pm reservation and made us wait over 40 mins  we had to leave  people kept going before us  if you planning on going make sure to go super early and with a small party 
tim was our server for our family on cny  he was really polite and professional throughout the hectic holiday  he kept his composure and apologized for delays and system screw ups  regardless of the issues they were having  i felt that he handled everything really well  lovely experience and delicious food! will be coming back  )
phyllis and sammy are the two greatest servers ever  shoutout for always refilling my water and pulling through with the hand wipes  you come for the great food and you get hooked on the amazing service  genuinely really attentive and always making sure you're having a good time  and just really sweet people in general!! wahoo!!
amazing!!! all the meats are tender and delicious! love the basil lamb chops and garlic shrimp  the addicting cabbage and cucumber are very addicting! it's one of very few restaurants in flushing with the cocktail drinks  love the co co mo! the sake is really good too  the servers all super friendly! a great place to hang out  will definitely be back again!
got the opportunity to be one of the first to try this new bbq hangout in flushing during the soft opening   quality meat selection and cook it yourself at your own pace   every bite is hot off the grill the way it should be   i'll be coming back when they open officially; be sure to try the garlic shrimp and the kalbi 
used to be a regular at the cooper sq location many years ago  the flavor just didn't do it for me at this location  also saw many sugary items on their limited menu    kind of a turn off  nothing really jumped out at me in a good way  food  5 10atmosphere  7 10 (nice place for group gatherings)price  5 10service  8 10 (very good staff)
this is probably one of the best delicious barbecue in flushing !!! the staffs are super super helpful and friendly  we went with an elderly in wheelchair and the hostess helped us from selecting the best accessible table  arranging the seating area and even helping us getting the wheelchair up the staircase  hats off to their services !!! the food is very much like the one in the city ! very valuable and stuffing  def recommend here for bday party and social gatherings  remember to use its app for collecting points and redeem rewards !!! will def come again !
it was my first time i visited this place today with my friend and i was beyond my expectation  main street flushing? people who live around this area or have been to this are know very well that this is not a go to place when it comes to finding a place to shop or eat  so crowded and dirty but this place has changed and i think gyu kaku japanese bbq definitely brings this area to a different level and helped to become a better place  we entered the place and the host guided us through the aisle and seated us  alan was our server and he did an incredible job in guiding us through the menus and "how to cook " he was attentive and kind in everything that when i needed something he would get them to me on time  after the meal  he got our check and the manager came up to our table with a big smile asking us how was the meal  we told her we loved it and i could already tell that she is very professional  her voice  gesture and eye contact definitely tells me that she is experienced plus all the servers were really nice and well trained  as soon as i got off this place  i told my friends to come with me to this place again next week  keep the good work guys! it's really challenging to work at a restaurant without losing smile and that energy you guys showed me and my friends  keep up the good work! i'll be back again  )
terrible hostess  makes a party of 2 wait for no reason and seats 2 other groups that came after
came here during happy hour during a saturday night and waited around 30 minutes to be seated for a table of 2 our server as very attentive despite it being very busy; he shared his thoughts on what he liked and introduced us to new menu items that weren't on the menu yet  waters were refilled automatically  grills changed frequently  and we received our food pretty fast  we ordered the happy hour set and i liked most of the food! starters  i enjoyed the soup  salad  and bibimbap  the dumplings were good but weren't as spicy as i thought they would be  bbq items  most of the items were delicious! but wasn't a fan of the spinach and chicken thighs  dessert  s'mores  i can't say much since i'm not a fan of s'mores  i was expecting small portions but i was full by the end of the meal  but if you're a bigger eater  i would suggest ordering more 
first time going with my dad and it was great! food was good  staff was nice and reasonable prices  i recommend come during happy hour too! stuff is cheaper and they have really good lunch specials! if you're in flushing definitely check it out!!
i came here for lunch on a monday  it wasn't packed but it was still pretty busy  the food was delicious and our waitress  phyllis  informed us of the cooking time for the meat  she was very helpful and friendly  what i liked best about this meal was her hospitality  it was a very memorable lunch and i would definitely come back and have phyllis as my waitress  even if there is a wait  i'll still come back 
if you are here for the drink  make sure sit in the bar   cuz is half price all day   but there is no sign !! be aware   other then that   after 9 30 is happy hour for food and drinks
really good service and high quality food  my only gripe would be the price  slightly high but still reasonable 
first time at gyu kaku and won't be the last! the service was excellent   they hired attentive and super friendly staff who really set the mood  our waiter was helpful with recommendations and we wound up choosing a set so we could try a variety of items  i can't keep track of what's what but the beef items were ridiculously delicious  my husband was incredibly stuffed and would still put down pieces (not his usual style at all  but he couldn't stop himself)  i have to remember next time to get all more beef than chicken or pork  try the calamari  and get the bibimbop again 
the new location seems smaller than the other locations but it still doesn't take away from how great it is in general  the service is excellent and everyone is so polite and helpful  the manager came over to make sure everything was fine and i thought that was great  our server was very attentive  we went out for my son's birthday and they sang to him and had a small happy birthday banner with a hat and a ice cream treat  he loved it  we will definitely be coming back here again since they're so attentive  we didn't have a reservation but we didn't wait more than 15 minutes when they originally gave us a 45 minute estimate  definitely recommend!
came her for a post birthday dinner with my brother and boyfriend  this place is located in the heart of flushing  where the roads and street are packed with people and cars and buses  we missed our reservation by 30 min due to issues finding parking (the only downfall   but its not the restaurants fault)  we were told the wait time would about 30 45 min but were allowed to wait in the bar area until our table was ready  our wait time was still really short  by the time we ordered and received our drinks our tables were ready (we maybe waited about 15 min on a busy night)  the entire staff were extremely nice and accommodating! we ordered mostly various kinds of steak  chicken  shrimp and assorted veggies  our favorite was the hangar steaks  deliciously marinated! our drinks were yummy as well  i would definitely come back here as everyone is welcoming and friendly
if you are into bbq and asian food  this should be your favorite spot  how can you not love this place? you get to cook!  ) so much fun with your friends and family  i came here during its soft opening  and oh man  this place so elegantly decorated  the wonderful looking japanese style partition walls provide you privacy and allow you to have a great conversation while cooking your own food  the food is tasty  the kobe meat is my favorite  and it tastes so good after only 30 seconds cooking each side  it also has a good selection of drinks as well as deserts  did i mention desert? the love cake i had is probably the best i ever tried on top of the good environment and tasty food  the service was excellent as well  the servers were super friendly and actually kneel or squat at your eye level to speak to you  definitely get 5 stars from me & i'm sure this will be my regular spot from now on   )
"this place is amazing  i came here for over the weekend  the staff was friendly  the meat quality was excellent and our server was phenomenal  we had kalbi special and i must say it is better than most  if not all korean bbq restaurants i've been to  for the side dishes i would highly recommend steamed chili dumplings and beef sukiyaki bibimbap  overall we had an amazing experience and we will definitely be back soon "
as this is a new place  everything looks neat and clean  the space at this location is not as spacious as the other guy kaku in new york  as this place used to be a small karaoke place located at the busiest street in flushing main street  their friendly staff and happy hour are competitively priced for most of the items  beating the other bbq places in the area  which makes it ideal for a quick bite for lunch and won't break the bank even if you go here often  the difference between this gyu kaku is that  they have less item on their menu compared to the other location in manhattan  depending on the time and day you are looling to go  reservation are recommended if you are going with a big party  as this place gets filled up quick  overall this place has a nice vibe  friendly staff  and a great addition of a bbq place for those that is in the area  looking forward to going back here again  no need to travel to manhattan if you're in the area 
went for the happy hour special  first half was great with all the beef and fried bacon  wasn't all that impressed with the pork belly and chicken  but it was ok  wish the staff would calm down a bit though with the japanese intro and exit shouting  i've been to other japanese restaurants that do this like ippudo  but they don't do it quite as annoyingly  the practically scream on top of their lungs to the point that they are probably losing their voice  other than  our waitress was friendly and the service was good  would come back  with ear plugs 
i've always been a huge korean bbq fan but have never tried japanese bbq so when i was told this new place opened up in flushing  i took my colleague there after work  when we entered the restaurant  we were greeted loudly  we sat in a very spacious booth seat  we ordered the gyu kaku combo for 2 people after seeing so many good reviews about it  it was only $60 and it was a great value! neither of us had much to eat throughout the day and we still left the place stuffed  the combo gives you 4 appetizers and 6 different meats (all beef but each are marinated differently!) and smores  our waiter jeremy was well groomed  mannered  and super attentive  he took initiative to come change our grills out every time before we cook something new  the drinks were made okay  i had the tokyo sunset and my colleague ordered the mango mai tai  mine tastes like straight up artificial fruit juice but it was still pretty decent  the mai tai tasted slightly better  drinks are all based on preference though  the bathrooms were very clean and orderly too  overall i had a really good first impression of the restaurant  definitely would recommend!!
this has been one of the best experiences at a restaurant  i took my brothers here with my fiancé and they loved it  it was there first time and they want to come back  everything was delicious  the waiters were perfect  chris is one if he best servers i've ever encountered  and the birthday surprise was amazing! keep it up
my experience today is not good at all  i can understand you reduce the amount of each dish  but how can you make a barbecue beef so tiny like chopped beef  it's like leftover beef 
extremely good service !!!! this place is a must try  the meat is well seasoned and taste really good  we order the kobe for 2 and everything came on time  the service was the best they were all very attentive and changed our grilling pan thing many times  they also refilled our waters and checked up on us a few times to see if we were good  the manager even came at one point to ask about our experience  there was also s'mores in the end  this is a must go to place everything is clean and service is awesome  i will definitely go back
our waiter eric was very attentive to our needs  he always came to change our grill constantly without us having to ask  this isnt the first time i've been to gyukakku  but i can definitely say the flushing branch is the best experience i've  had by far  i will definitely come again and try their other menu items!
i've been to gyu kaku many times in midtown with reservations  i made one for this flushing location for dinner and was quoted a 5 minute our table to be ready and that we were next  30 minutes pass and we spoke to the hostess  seems like they forgot about us  needless to say we did not give them out business 
great japanese bbq restaurant  very nice atmosphere although very expensive  must try the $55 wagyu steak 
good managers there especially dennis(or daniel?)  any not so good service or food there  talked to the managers and they got fixed immediately flavors are good and atmosphere is good too 
i found this restaurant by chance and am very glad i did   the food was delicious as was dessert (the lava cake is to die for)   the service was great   the manager came over to chat and ask if everything was ok   happy hour prices all day until 6 and lunch specials until 3   our  server  sammy  was very helpful and great   very attentive wait staff   really enjoyed the experience!
i come here all the time and every time the service is great ( alan and eric are extremely helpful )  the food is fantastic   and the atmosphere is fun!
overall is ok  the service was good  however  i felt the food is slightly better in an other gyukaku store in midtown 
i typically don't write reviews unless it's a bad one to warn people away from something but for gyu kaku  i had to give them a good review  the staff is so on point from the time you walk in the door  straight through to the end  wait staff knew the menu well  checked on us constantly and were almost too friendly  the manager stopped by twice to make sure everything was ok and even remembered our names when he came back the second time around even with a packed restaurant  the food was amazing!! we had the premium for 2 bbq and each item was better than the last  huge amount of food for only $35 each  the wait staff explained each item and how to cook it  also helped that happy hour starts at 9pm for heavily discounted drinks  every bit of it was enjoyable and i will most definitely recommend and will be back 
we've been here several times! food is great! we always have a pleasant time  we fight over the radishes!!! lol pork belly is delish! and i love the sauces!! if you've never gone     you better get going!!!! parking lot is huge  i believe valet  enjoy!
amazing service by jennifer and her coworkers  food was excellent and instructions for cooking food are simple and easy to follow  the appetizers  main course and desserts were fantastic 
love guy kaku!! this location is new  but just as awesome  you can not beat their happy hour  me and my friend had a bottle of sake and two cocktails for $19 60! also  the rewards points are cool  after 500 points you get $25 off your entire bill! that doesn't seem like much but considering their amazing happy hour  it could cover an entire bill  this location is not as packed as the other locations  but i'm sure it's only a matter of time before the buzz gets out!
as a frequent customer to the guy kaku chain  i am no stranger to the food and the flushing outpost is no different in terms of food  however what makes them stand out is the service   i visited for the first time and i must say i was floored by their outstanding service  everyone was beyond friendly  our server was sammy and she was beyond courteous  attentive and friendly  we are foodies and in all the restaurants we've ever visited from hole in the walk to 5 star locales  never have i come across anyone like her  she has offered us refills on waters  and helped us changed our grills more than enough times  she strike conversations with our son and mind you it was during busy dinner hour  we even over heard her offer help to the bus boy and said thanks to him several times  what a great person she is?!
had a great time  staffs are very attentive  the food are very tasty and marinate on point  great interior design  awesome lava cake! the cod is amazing! over all is great experience  will go back again soon
i love gyukaku! price is good  food's taste is good  service is good too! after 9pm  happy hour time is great!! definitely this is geatest place in flushing!
the manager denis is the goat  been to every single gyu in the nyc area  i was even a gold member because i accumulated so many points  but believe me when i say no one hooked me up like this spot! mentioned how much i liked a certain dressing and he made sure i got a plenty 
the decor is refreshing especially in flushing where everything seems to be fast paced and cramped  i have been to the main location in manhattan multiple times as it is near my office  it would always be a treat to go to gyu kaku  when i saw the spot open in flushing i was eager to try it out  i tried the kobe style special  first  unlike the manhattan location they don't substitute items that you maybe allegeric to  second  the food we ordered was premium but all of the foods taste was anything but premium the meat was flavorless  the rice or bibmbop was bland  service was fairly attentive  but if you are like me looking for the gyu kaku from manhattan reborn in flushing you will fall short  you will find an over priced and signficiantly different restaurant than the one that has a great reputation  save your wallet and your stomach and go to a korean bbq place or the real gyu kaku in manhattan where the food is actually fantastic 
honestly one of the best lunches meals in recent memory  food was fantastic  service was fantastic  i will return 
the food is delicious and so are the drinks  best to go during lunch or evening happy hour 
i love the other locations of gyu kaku so i was very excited to try out this recently opened queens location   it was a bit noisy in general due to the music and everyone talking but then that happens to most restaurants   our servers ian and there's another guy name koyo ( not sure if i spelled correctly) were very attentive  courteous and explained everything perfectly esp ian   i love the 45th location and even i don't remember if their service is as good as this place   love all the beef items and even the pork belly was good even thou i was never a pork fan   had the $55 for 2 during hh and picked 2 more rice dishes and a few more other dishes   love the beef sukiyaki bibibap & garlic rice and the calmari as well   overall  a great experience and lives up to the gyu kaku name   keep up the good!!
came here on sunday for happy hour  the food was delicious  we ordered a lot and we were not disappointed  our waiter provided great service  explained how everything worked since most of us were first timers  we would definitely come back here again!
this is an amazing place!   food is to die for   calamari cooked to perfection    and phyllis the bartender is one of the sweetest and helpful waitstaff i've ever encountered  prices are excellent!
i went here for my sister's birthday and the service was great  our server was palm  and he was attentive to our orders  the food was great  although the grill was a bit hotter than the grills at other gyu kaku locations  so we had to make sure that our food didn't burn  even with the recommended cooking times   after we were done with the appetizers and the meats  palm and the other staff members came out to sing happy birthday to my sister  at my request  when it was time to pay  there was an error on our check  but palm quickly corrected it after it was brought to his attention  overall  we had a great time!
i really enjoyed this place! $5 happy hour  great staff and music  you will definitely enjoy with friends or family! everyone was friendly and upbeat  food was delicious as well  the only downside is the location   no parking so you are better off taking the train  i will be returning soon 
pho best is a no frills viet chinese place in a new ish flushing mall (arcadia mall)  the pho is delicious  the service is polite and curt  the staff is mostly chinese  my friend was craving pho so she choose this place we shared the vietnamese summer rolls  i ordered the fresh rib eye and tendon pho + roasted bone marrow  the pho was almost as good as i've had in philly (instagram com p bh2ohs_n…)  the bone marrow is enormous (mine was the size of my forearm)  the pho's beef broth is rich and savory  the noodles were perfectly blanched and had a good snap in the umami broth  the ribeye was plentiful  i wish there was more tendon the bone marrow was good  it was roasted and caramelized  it was sprinkled with sugar but it wasn't necessary for the pho  we were offered complimentary coconut jello with yellow split peas  just like my mom likes it my friends ordered the viet coffee  that looked so cool with the coffee dripping into the cup from a metal apparatus and then the waiter mixes it for you  i want to return for more pho and to try the viet coffee  instagram com snackchatn…
i have to give yelp some credit where credit is due  i neverrrrr would have found this place if not for yelp  i was actually born and raised in flushing  but now live in the city    so i'm out of the loop  good thing there's yelp to come in the clutch when i'm visiting my parents in flushing and craving some decent pho and spring rolls  and come in the clutch yelp did! this place was worth the 4 star hype  i was deciding between pho best i and pho best ii (both of which i found on yelp) and the reviews steered me towards this location  the consensus seemed to be that the broth and chef here were better  the reviews were right  this location is great  the servers are nice and the food is straight up delicious  my parents and i ordered   grilled chicken noodle soup   got rave reviews from my dad  he said the chicken was very flavorful and seasoned well  he can't eat red meat  s i'm really happy he was pleased  classic pho with well done meat   my mom slurped the entire thing up  nothing was left    grilled beef noodle soup   this is what i got  the broth was really tasty  the beef itself was actually the only thing i didn't 100% love because it was kind of greasy and forgettable  grilled pork chop   we got this to share a the table  this was the best thing we ordered  sooooooo delicious and tasty   spring rolls to share   ok first of all   they only give you literally 2 mint leaves with the order  for 8 spring rolls  weird  but at lease they obliged when i asked for more mint leaves  the spring rolls were good  not great  they could be improved  everything was reasonably priced  which i appreciate greatly  but even with the two areas of possible improvement (spring rolls and grilled beef)  this place was still solid 4 stars quality  exactly like yelp said it would be    will be back for more grilled pork chops and noodle soup 
i guess the area is not for me  i don't like how hard it is to drive to the area and parking on the street is terrible  there is always traffic by the area  i wonder if pho best validates the parking  my friend told me no they don't because she was wondering the same thing  that is not why i dropped it a star though  i got a dried out lime where visually you can tell the lime is dry  okay which is fine  i just asked for more but when she brought out a brand new plate of limes  they all were dried out  my pho was cold by the time this all played out  i still could not get any limes with juice in it  the portion size for the rice dishes i find a bit small too for the price in comparison to other places  also the fried squid was very small portioned for the price  squid is very cheap as a product  my bf ordered the pho and his barely had much meat on it  i was surprised by the portion size of the meat my vietnamese friend told me the staff is not vietnamese  but to me that doesn't matter  if it matters to you if they are vietnamese or not  they are chinese 
don't get the large pho unless you're absolutely starving and haven't eaten the whole day  or else you'll stuff yourself silly and feel like an angry birds about to explode (not that i've experienced it) pho best is located in arcadia mall  a little walk from the 7 train  the space looks better than average and clean  service was also a step above normal  the menu is comprehensive  with the great prices and food quality  i know i will be back to try different offerings!#1 with bone marrow +$3large bowl of beefy goodness (maybe even good for 2?) with generous cuts of beef  some tendons and tripe  the broth itself was perfect   savory  not salty  i have to say  the marrow elevated each bite  it's genius to have this as extra!my brother got the lobster pho ($15) and was satisfied with it  he said the shrimp spring rolls were pretty good too!
located inside the unpopular arcadia mall  i would've never known this place existed if it weren't for social media   despite showing up at an odd meal time (saturday at 3pm)  our party of two still had to wait about 15 minutes for a table because the place was packed   this was a little annoying especially since there is only 1 hour street parking in the area   expect to leave mid meal to feed the meter the standard pho here is more expensive than you would find at other pho shops in the area and the broth is a bit different  darker and more full bodied   of course  we tried each of their claims to fame  the lobster pho ($14 95) and the bone marrow ($3)   the lobster pho came with noodles  broth  and a whole lobster  which were all tasty  but as expected  very inconvenient to eat; breaking down the lobster was very messy   as for the bone marrow  i can see why people would like it  but i personally found it to be overly salty and sickeningly fatty   i'm not a fan in addition  we also got the grilled beef appetizer ($6 95) and another bowl of rib eye  brisket  tendon  and tripe pho ($8 25)   the beef appetizer was sweet and savory and tender  yum!  and the beef pho was just as good as the lobster one 
the place is inside the arcadia mall off of franklin and main i typically hesitate in going to eat in places located in flushing because the neighborhood is so dirty  however  i had multiple people recommend this place and also the yelp reviews persuaded me to try it i'm glad i listened  it was definitely delicious  the pho broth is delicious and not salty! amen! bone marrow is a must  the crab patty is also delicious even tho the presentation for me looked a bit unappealing the vermicelli plate with meat and spring rolls was good  the meat was a bit tough but taste was great the lamb and pork were fantastic! try it!over all we loved this place  and its priced super fairly  the service is fine also oh yes and the fresh lemonade is so yummy as well as the ice coffee  just go and try it!
after black label donuts popup in pesso's  definitely  lunch time so one of my friends suggested pho best and both of them written amazing reviews so i couldn't wait to pop that cherry today  there's a parking garage that connects to the arcadia mall because on the weekends you are lucky to even try to find a parking space on the streets in flushing  pho best is on the first floor in the arcadia mall  i spotted an empty 4 seater in the corner by the window  my two friends ordered fresh rib eye big bowl  brisket  tripe  tendon and i ordered fresh rib eye and tendon  i only saw two pieces of tendon though in my pho but the broth base was delicious as tc pointed out to me  i love combining sriracha and hoisin sauce into my pho   i need the extra flavor haha and oooo they gave you many slices of rib eye mmmm i love meat! i wasn't able to eat the complimentary coconut dish because i am allergic sadly so my friends split mine  overall a yummy pho spot so bookmark it baby!
no faux pas here  pho best lives up to its name and then some  they are doing things right here  the pho broth is satisfyingly rich and full of that savory and robust beefy flavor pho addicts crave for located in arcadia mall you would figure any pho restaurant in a mall setting would be mediocre at best  boy was i wrong! pho best stakes it's claim here and by the taste and likes of it will be here for the long haul i ordered the extra large bowl of pho which comes with cuts of uber delicious and tender rib eye  brisket  tendon and tripe  it may sound silly but the meat is draped over the pho in such a way that it's drool worthy  the meat is thinly sliced and will literally melt in your mouth  one taste of the broth and meat and you will be hooked phoever! we ordered a variety of different pho and they were all delish  the secret as all pho lovers know is the broth  you know you must be doing something right when you notice most bowls going back to the kitchen are empty we ordered the bbq chicken vermicelli which is prepared with peanuts  pickled daikon  carrots  cucumbers and bean sprouts  the chicken was moist and seasoned perfectly i love the coffee here  i actually got a full glass of viet coffee brought to my table already filtered through  my past experience with these little filters were a crap shoot  the coffee either filtered through  or would get stuck and take an eternity to pass through like a bad kidney stone  i think most of the coffee is already brewed in the back and brought out for the last few drips as it completely finishes it's journey through the filter great service complete with smiling and friendly servers  pho best for now is imho the best place in queens to get your pho fix!
pho best restaurant definitely offers the best bowl of pho in queens   i came here during a snowstorm and it was pretty empty  i came here with a group of approximately 8 people   we ordered and our food came out really fast   the spring roll with fish sauce is on point and was a huge hit at our table   it disappeared in seconds   majority of the table ordered the lobster and pho  and for $15 you get pho and a whole lobster cooked to perfection   i feel like the lobster and pho was the best bang for the buck   a few others ordered the typical beef pho   and if you want you can add a bone marrow for $3   it definitely does add an extra element of richness to your soup   for $3? it's worth a try   so go for it!!most of the people at our table was not able to finish their food  that's how big the portions were   i can't wait to come back  i'll definitely be returning soon   also as a bonus  they give you free dessert as other reviewers has mentioned  i got the coconut jello with red bean  which i really enjoyed because it was delicious and free!  with great food and customer service  this place hopefully will be around for many years to come 
my partner in crime and i were craving for pho and we decide to try this place out  thanks to the photos! this is a quiet  open restaurant in arcadia mall and it was not crowded on a friday evening  decor is industrial like especially the golden clock piece on the wall  the place was also well kept that it is very clean  the food comes in big portions and it is not expensive at all! we ordered the following  vietnamese iced drip coffee; fried spring rolls; #2 pho with fresh rib eye  brisket  tendon  and tripe; whole lobster pho; bone marrow; and crab patty both pho dishes had very fresh ingredients i am in love with the texture of the vermicelli  i like the soft and smooth  i do like the rich rice flavor in the vermicelli  broth could be more flavorful but i have no complaints  the regular beef pho broth was more flavorful than the lobster  the lobster was more clean and light  bone marrow added a rich flavor to both of our pho so i definitely recommend it! both bowls were really big and it did a great job satisfying our cravings  fried spring rolls were freshly fried but it was not greasy at all  crab patty tasted more like pork but it was a nice side dish to try  vietnamese iced drip coffee  it was a nice experience seeing it drip right in front of me  the coffee was bold and dark  it comes with condensed milk in the bottom and i could've used more to cut the bitterness  service was excellent  staff members were very welcoming and friendly since my very first step into the restaurant  teas were being refilled and dishes were taken away in a timely manner  awesome!yes  we would come back!
located in the arcadia mall on the ground level  we had lunch here on a saturday and was seated right away  no wait at all  the restaurant is very clean  service was quick  we had chicken chop with rice  summer rolls and typical pho noodles  broth was tasty  good amount of noodles  we also ordered pork chop with rice along with crab meat and egg for take out  unfortunately they messed up on the ordered and gave us pork chop with rice only  the pork chop was a little hard and dry  i'm sure it was prob just miscommunication  their summer roll was on point  price was decent i would definitely return and try their pho with bone marrow  it look delicious 
we thought the food was very good  although not all bone marrow had marrow  the lobster was surprisingly fresh  not sure how all the other businesses stay open in this mall  the spring rolls were extremely good  skins were light and crispy  service was also good  w came in the afternoon on a weekday 
it's gimmicky  i'll say  lobsta & oven roasted bone marrow for your pho? unheard of  but fun and delicious quite reasonably priced too  i won't say much more than that  in case owners think "hrmmm mayybe we should jack this up a notch" the broth? healthy i think  not dosed up with msg  could use a little more salt fish sauce something to be saltier  it's definitely beefy though  i came out without feeling the need to drink a gallon of water  probably a good sign 
i wouldn't classify this place as authentic viet  but neither is ginger & lemongrass  however  i would say pho best is more authentic than g&l  i love how huge the pho is and that it includes tendons  tripe and brisket and much cheaper than g&l even with the bone marrow  i think the broth could use more flavor as it wasnt as rich as i wanted it to be  in terms of appetizers  the calamari was crispy and not too chewy  the crispy shrimp spring rolls were huge and contains actual whole shrimp  beef cubed over rice was tender and juicy  and again massive portions!  great prices makes this place a must try! they even have a whole lobster option for $15  wow  i will definitely be back to try more items  plus free dessert at the end of the meal (coconut pudding with yellow beans) 
pho best really is the best  pho place can be easy to miss since they only have one sign in the front of the arcadia mall on main street   the best way to enter is to go through dunkin donuts and pho best will be on the left ordered the $15 lobster pho and the beef brisket pho ($8) with extra bone marrow ($3) the lobster pho is probably the best bang for you buck since they give you a small medium sized lobster and a ton of noodles   the broth was very unique and every sip was like sipping a piece of lobster  without having lobster shells in your mouth   it can get messy eating a whole lobster and eating pho at the same time  but the meat was sure tasty and fresh beef brisket pho was on the oily side  i think the bone marrow made it extra greasy  but it added a ton of depth and flavor into the broth   generous portion of noodles and your regular fixings and pho garnishments like thai basil and sprouts with lime after the meal  we were served with complimentary dessert   we had the red bean flan pudding service was great and our waters were always filled 
came back again for brunch! tried their bbq squid  shrimp pineapple fried rice  some sort of stir fried clams  and lemon grass fillet mignon  (listed by most favored to least)it seems like they know what they are doing with their bbq stuff! great flavor and texture!the stir fried clams were tasty but a little undercooked  which wasn't a big problem bc you could just send it back and they will happily cook it longer for u  the lemon grass fillet mignon did not taste viet lolll  it was like that chinese viet fusion stuff; it tastes alright but not what i was expecting from the usual viet lemon grass dishes 
the pho broth is decent  their sliced beef is very tender and i like that you can add different sides to your pho  portions are very reasonable  its a good place to go for a quick meal and satisfying one  i like the free dessert at the end of the meal 
pho best is one of the better vietnamese restaurant chains in new york city    and its arcadia mall location feels like the more comfortable of the chain's two flushing locations what we've had   'fresh rib eye big bowl  brisket  tripe  tendon' (火車頭一號牛肉粉    'train pho #1')  with bone marrow  very large portion  with a very good broth  the bone marrow (an extra $3) is presented on a very large bone  from which you then scrap the bone marrow into the soup  while bone marrow does enhance the flavor of the soup  the bone itself gets in the way of eating  this 'train pho #1' does well without the bone marrow  too   grilled chicken with rice (燒雞飯)  very good  with well marinated chicken and juicy chicken   lobster pho (原隻龍蝦)  the lobster is a bit chewy  but the dish is a great value at $14 95 
pho best is still good    but not the best in flushing  this place is great if your want quantity but for quality and authenticity  there's a new spot  my first time here  i really enjoyed the food  huge bowl of pho with lobster for cheap? gotta love it and if i wanted that again  i'll definitely come back for that; and i loved the pork chops  but the second time i had it wasn't as great as the first  perhaps i had so much more? no  it had less char grilled flavor  still good and an excellent deal   3 pork chops with side salad for $7 25  i got a side of fried rice for $3 5  l chose filet mignon with shrimp rice vermicelli  the filet was so soft  barely had to chew  but we both agreed that it would've tasted better if it had the same marinade as the pork chops  wasn't a fan of the sauce but once everything was mixed  it was tasty nonetheless  they gave us water when we sat down  but i would've preferred hot tea  i noticed the other tables with only asian customers received hot tea  perhaps they shouldn't assume that if there's an non asian in your party that they would like tap water    so we ordered coconut water  i do not drink tap  i guess i could've asked for hot tea 
i'm glad i found this place  thanks to chun m  for posting review and pictures  the food looks instagram worthy especially the lobster pho! omg  after seeing the picture i went the following day for lunch  the place is inside the mall  its new and clean and we got seated right away  for drinks i got the lemonade and its really what i want  its a bit sour and sweet  we start off with 2 types of appetizer  vietnamese crispy spring rolls 8 pieces for $9 50  its very crispy from the outside and flavorful in the inside  i got the spider summer rolls with soft shell crab $8 95  i love soft shell crab and this is perfect  for main dish i got the pho with brisket and added the bone marrow  this is so worth it  i got the small size but its huge! you can share up to 2 people  the broth  the texture of the meat and the bone marrow is just so amazingly tasty! my bf got the lobster pho and he enjoyed everything! the lobster is so tender and delicious  i tried some of this and surely i'll order this next time we go back  for dessert i got their plan but its not really that good  don't get any dessert because they give some complimentary dessert after  its a coconut puddling this place is great!  fast service and delicious food 
pho best? we'll see about that   there's another one to go with the one on prince st? there's no street entrance at this location  but it's nestled inside the new arcadia mall on main st  so go all the way in and you'll see it  or take a short cut through the at&t store  you have to try the standard by which all pho places are judged  the #1 locomotive 火車頭  broth is dark  rich  beefy  with that perfect aroma combination of star anise  cinnamon and cloves  it's like they boiled down the bones of an entire cow into this bowl   rice noodles have the perfect chewy give and clump as you slurp and bite  and the giant bowl is loaded with plenty of beef!  the beef eye round is so tender  you can pull it apart with a tug of your chopsticks  along with the sliced brisket  beef tripe & tendon  this is quite possibly the best bowl of pho! (at least in queens) you might think $9 25 is a little steep but it is totally worth it! next time i'm going to add the roasted marrow bone ($3)  know what else is cool?  they have solved the problem of burning fingers while serving giant steaming bowls of scalding soup  engineering solution  bring each bowl out on its own wooden serving platform! the dais also raises the bowl closer to your mouth which makes slurping easier and less mess  flavor  elegance and ergonomics all designed into one meal!match that with a side of vietnamese spring rolls and you have the perfect lunch on a cold winter's day  must come back to try the rest of the menu though  complimentary mung bean gelatin for dessert? how nice is that!
pho best differentiates itself by offering a modern flair to traditional vietnamese dishes and is definitely worthy of a few photos    pork chop with rice   perfectly seasoned and comes in 3 pieces  highly recommend  grilled chicken with rice   same as above and unbelievably juicy  this is better than most restaurants  vermicelli with spring rolls and pork chop   very flavorful  with pickled garlic and daikon radish  interesting vinegar taste that lingers in your mouth for hours after  classic pho   generous portion and pretty much amazing   shrimp spring roll appetizer   jumbo sized shrimp wrapped and fried  i actually prefer this over the traditional version i also appreciate the complementary dessert  although the coconut curd was not that great  it's the gesture that counts  i hope they are able to expand in the mall because it does seem a bit tight in there sometimes 
lobster pho!!! yes  you read that right  lobster in pho! for only $15  this is totally worth it  it's literally a whole lobster swimming in a bowl of pho  the lobster itself tastes pretty fresh and has a nice bite to it  they do a good job of not overcooking it  it does get messy  but who cares  it's lobster  i just wish there were some slices of beef in the pho or have that as an add on option because i felt that it didn't have enough meat from the lobster for the amount of noodles  been here twice and learned from the first time to order a grilled pork chop on the side  but i'd much rather have beef slices moving on to the pho with everything (the first option) and bone marrow add on  bomb com  love the bone marrow  it adds such a nice creamy texture to the broth  the best part about this is that they have plenty of beef slices!took off one star because the broth itself is a little lacking  it's good  but not the best i've had  and trust me  i've had a lot of pho  also  the bowl is big and they give a lot of soup  but honestly  it's not as much food as it may seem  for reference i'm a 5ft asian girl with a normal appetite and i finished the whole thing i brought my bf's family here and they really liked this spot    that says a lot because they're a super picky asian family  overall  would recommend!!
omg this place was soooo good and super cheap! i got the vermicelli salad with pork chop and my husband for the lobster pho with bone marrow  both were really good and super filling  the portions are huge so don't get crazy and order a bunch of things thinking it'll be small portions for the price  i almost made that mistake and i'm sure glad i didn't  the service was super quick too  i came here on a sunday night so i can't speak for other days note  this place is inside arcadia mall  it's tucked in the corner  next to the dunkin donuts  i was having a pregnancy craving for some vietnamese food when i found this place on yelp  no one really speaks english but it's enough to get by  the staff is really sweet and helpful  i definitely plan on coming back 
pho best has become my favorite vietnamese restaurant in flushing  the atmosphere is very clean  airy and the food is super flavorful  i came here with 2 girlfriends early evening on a monday  there was plenty of seating at this time  we ordered the following dishes  traditional pho with the $3 bone marrowrice vermichelli with pork chop seafood vietnamese noodles we all picked from each other's dishes  & couldn't stop raving about our choices  everything was very delicious  full of flavor and extremely generous in portion  we can't wait to return and try out other items on the menu 
pho best is one of the more modern decor and nicer pho spots in flushing  while keeping the prices at affordable  they have clean bathrooms and polite staffs unlike many of the other pho spots in the area  the #1 pho broth is super beefy compared to that of the pork chop pho  which is more clean and less meaty tasting  the portions were comparable to that of other pho spots and definitely a filling meal  we could have done without the shrimp rolls appetizer  but were intrigued by all the raves about them  unfortunately  we didn't really think they were anything special and would prefer the traditional vietnamese spring rolls  they tasted like the spring rolls you get at dim sum  the pho came out super fast  while the shrimp spring roll took some time (as they were probably making them fresh)  overall  i enjoyed my meal at pho best and would most likely return for more vietnamese food 
best pho? no  so why 5 stars?because i said so  no  but really i couldn't really find a flaw in this place  ok so the people that work here mostly are chinese and not really vietnamese  but then again asian is asian right?wrong!this place is legit good though  portion size was exactly what i was looking for to fit the bill  i can eat  namaste the flavor of the broth wasn't overly rich and certainly was not bland  it was a really good balance  the toppings of course adds to the overall dish  now  sometimes when you go to vietnamese places or pho places and you ask your meat to be well done  they look at your funny  here  they just do it because that is what's up  and while not all meat tastes great fully cooked  unless it's a fine steak  wagyu or kobe  or even a well marinated one  do yourself a favor and ask for well done  why?because inferior cuts just tastes better that way  in my opinion  the service  quick efficient and no bullsh*t  the space was plentiful  now  it is located inside arcadia mall and while you don't have to go through the double doors of the mall to find the place  it is the most polite way to do it  because tous les jours  this herbal store  among others have a direct back entrance that you can go through to enter the mall saves time? 20 seconds saved   maybe fan 
pho best is a nice welcome to the outskirts of flushing  it competes with a dumpling galaxy  a tous les jours  niu pot hot pot & a fujianese restaurant for customers and has a basement parking lot  there is far less foot traffic in this lesser known strip mall so less wait time for your food!! restrooms for all customers are located in the basement as well it was pretty empty on a wednesday night but i could see great potential during weekday lunch hours being as it is surrounded by medical offices and nearby businesses  the menu has your typical vietnamese pho  vermicelli  banh mi's  & cubed beef rice dishes  i wish they had a chicken or vegetable broth option for their pho noodle soup  they messed up our orders twice but replaced our food fairly quickly  the bf and i both each ordered pho's  one beef and one grilled chicken with a side order of crab patty  the broth was pretty clean tasting and flavorful  it was served with the standard plate of bean sprouts  thai basil and limes but no jalapenos  i love adding jalepenos to my pho broth so that was disappointing  the spider summer roll was tasty but i wouldn't order it again  we got free coconut mung bean desserts at the end  that was a nice touch from pho best they take credit cards so thats a plus 
nice addition to flushing! the phó is pretty good  the broth is clear and not overly rich & oil  the bowl (esp  #1 big phó)  is a bit big for the amount of noodles but it's still a good amount enough to fill you up    while this is a decent tasty phó  it isn't the best we've had but it's good to satisfy your needs aside from the traditional phó with sliced beef & tendon  you can also get it with chicken  pork  fish balls etc  it's a nice variety  we added bone marrow to our phó for $3 extra and thought that we could prob skip it next time  it was just for show as it was just bone was pretty empty   otherwise  would def come back to try other dishes 
1  big bowl  beef brisket  ribeye  & tripethis came out almost instantly  it was good but the broth could be richer  my friend devoured it  so that's a good sign  2  filet mignon & shrimp w  rice vermicelli we had to wait nearly 25 minutes for this dish the filet mignon was well marinated  there were only three pieces of shrimp  the rice vermicelli  bean sprouts  and other greens made the whole dish itself very well  balanced  3  tom yum clams terrible  terrible  terrible  the colors were so nice  but the sauce tasted so weird and the clams are way too small for this kind of dish  medium sized clams would have been better  free complimentary dessert it was a cute little piece of cake  aw  i do appreciate the gesture  however  it does not suit the theme of the restaurant  other  i wish the waiters came around to refill our drinks  other than that  everything was pretty good  i would come back again when i'm in the mood for some good vietnamese food   )
if you are unfamiliar with queens at all  like me  it may be difficult to find this little eatery inside the arcadia mall  using navigation "you have arrived at your destination" and i still continued to circle the block unsure where it was(see photo) plus parking is like  the worst  side streets people!so i walked two blocks and found the building (recessed from the rest)fyi  the bathrooms are downstairs  the staff are polite and my pho big bowl was served quickly  the marrow bone is a nice touch for extra nutrients which i just love  the broth had a slightly stronger taste of anise then i've had before  the marrow added some depth  i also had a lemon ice tea which was unsweetened  i would return if i was in the neighborhood  the other menu items(and what i saw other people dining) looked top notch 
came here with the husband on a friday for a lunch date just to try their pho and such this new place did not disappoint us at all  especially the crispy shrimp spring roll  which was out of this world           delicious  light  extra crispy  and beyond fresh!!! we loved it so much that we thought a small order of 4 pieces was not enough! =dthe restaurant is very clean and comfortable  located on the first floor of the arcadia mall (black building)  for the pho  my husband gave it a 3  kinda too oily but the taste of the soup was there  he liked the noodle they used  too bad the husband and i are not really into bone marrows because heard you can order your bowl of pho with a whole piece of bone marrow with extra charge  it did look cool though oh we saw the table next to us ordered a bowl of noodle with a whole lobster! wow  so fulfilling for lunchtime! it did look very fresh and yummilicious!for the grilled pork vermicelli  i gave it a 3 5  it was super neat that they served the food on a clay pot  i liked the ingredients used and the vegetable selections  best thing is they don't automatically include cucumber which i'm highly allergic to! no need to even ask them to remove it for me yay ;)for the crispy shrimp spring roll  we both gave it a 5!!!!! absolutely loved every bite of it!! highly recommend!!the dishes come in generous big portions! i had trouble finishing my dish and i'm eating for two haha the service is very good  they have some attentive staff who refills your water and tea without asking  they also have friendly smiles on their faces  they sure know how to make their customers happy and satisfied  happy customer happy life lolthe husband and i must go back to try other things on the menu!!we also have to go back for the most amazing crispy shrimp spring roll  can i eat the regular vietnamese spring roll after this? that's debatable hahahahaha ;d
pho best  maybe not  but it's decent   located in the arcadia mall  it's been some time since a new player has entered in the viet food scene in flushing and although it's not great  it's got potential the space is modern and clean   on the day i went  it just so happened that the health department was inspecting and i got to watch as the inspector seemed to be giving them an "a"  which is good for all prospective diners   the service here is also pretty good as they're polite and quick food here is ok but imo not great   there's a pretty extensive menu but of course i had to try the pho   the quality of the meat is pretty good  the portions large but the broth is a bit weak which is critical to any bowl of pho   the broth is just lacking the depth of an authentic bowl prepared by authentic viet restaurants  which leaves it a bit lacking   prices are fair and there's a complimentary dessert which is a nice touch   definitely has some room for improvement but on the plus side  it's a nice cleaner option to the other viet places in flushing 
loved the food  but please do something about the chairs! yes  the chairs  but before i get to that i will say that the pho was the best i've had in queens in a long time  the bone marrow pho bowl is an exercise in decadence  it is presented neatly a top a wooden tray complete with spoon rest  the broth was flavorful  the meat slices thin  the veggie toppings plentiful  and the large bone with marrow exposed ready to be spooned our delicious  we also ordered the crispy squid which arrived atop fresh mint leaves and diced pepper  it was crunchy and just the right level of salty  we followed that up with summer rolls which came neatly packed with shrimp and finished off with clams in basil sauce  back to the chairs    everything was good  and it's too bad the chairs offered such a poor seating experience  i swear it's like the backs curved inwards  unless you sit straight as a board you just want to get out of the chair  which is too bad because there so much good food to enjoy 
this location is inside the arcadia mall  i've been to the one on prince st twice  and it's exactly the same menu  the bone marrow is not good   so congealed and solid  doesn't melt into the broth the way ginger and lemongrass' does  the #1 pho is pretty good and it's my go to! i like that they give you a lot of beef! but i don't like their spring rolls (skin is too thick and chewy) or anything else they offer except the #1 pho  also  $1 75 extra for one wing and $3 50 extra for one tiny lambchop?!?!?!?!??! don't do the add ons!
finally a decent pho place in flushing! it seems like it just open not that long ago  inside a small food shopping center  they don't have an actual sign on the outside  so it was a little difficult to find  i eat pho a lot and this place did not disappoint  me and my sister got the #2 pho on the menu  there's only one size  you can pay more to add on bone marrow  pork chop  etc  broth was good  you can taste it was cooked for a long time and that it's not just salt or msg  giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the cups they use to pour tea and utensils seems very old and dirty  there were cracks on our cups and spoons were given to us with stains  that is definitely something they need to improve on  other than that  service was quick and staff was friendly 
decided to try this place rather than go to our usual pho in downtown flushing  nice civilized atmosphere  lots of families with young children  service was very polite and attentive  however the food is just not the best vietnamese you can get in flushing  the pho broth was a bit weak and the rice noodles were a bit over cooked  the pork rice vermicelli was served in a lovely stone bowl but also lacking the usual punch of flavors  fried spring rolls did not come with mint or fish sauce  shrimp sugar cane was cold in the center like it was just superficially reheated  come here for a nice experience and ok food with good presentation  go to downtown flushing across the library for really delicious food in a dingy environment 
pros   portions are big (the regular size is pretty big and the large is huge)  the spider summer roll was very yummy (the peanut sauce is excellent here) but i still prefer the freshness of a classic shrimp summer roll   the pho bowls include tripe!  prices on the pre opening menu are very reasonable but will probably go up  i love the free dessert they served (some sort of coconut pudding) cons   the beef bone add on is literally just a bone; hardly any meat or bone marrow on there  not even worth the $3 pre opening price  i wish there are other options for pho  like grilled meat or beef ball  for people who don't like the regular beef slicesoverall  broth and noodles were good but like any other pho place  impressed with the peanut sauce and will return for the jumbo shrimp summer roll  the grilled pork chop add on is yummy and worth it!
pros very generous portions  a lot of meat in their pho as well as noodles!they offer a small dessert at the end for free cons the bone marrow isn't as worth as you think  the bone is big however there might not be much bone marrow inside!i got the rack of lamb with my pho which tasted very good but it was very small as well  i've been here twice so far and i definitely think their pho is good for the price  if you wanna get their extra things with the pho it's fun for an experience but i don't personally think it's as worth the money  with that being said i also really wanna try their lobster pho  i've heard good things about that!
this is probably one of the best place to get vietnamese food in flushing  coming from philadelphia where pho is the best thing ever  i noticed that flushing lacked a really good pho place thus far this place has the best pho  but if you're not a pho person  they also have really good rice dishes 
best ribeye steak in pho! no other pho place actually give you ribeye this juicy and deliciously textured!i think it's my new favorite pho spot to cure hangover in flushing now the broth with the added bone marrow tasted much more fatty and you get more of that grilled aroma  it's great if that's what you're looking for the iced viet coffee was watered down    and yes i've drained the water from the ice before mixing   but they do give you a small complimentary dessert at the end!
not that bad  just average pho  i grew up eating a pho bang my entire life and i decided to try this place for convenience  i ordered the same thing that i usually do which is pho with grilled pork with the vietnamese crispy spring rolls  the price is pretty average to what i am used to  the bowls were huge as well but my bowl of pho had very little noodles  the ratio was 1 4 in terms of noodles to soup which was pretty disappointing  another issue that i have is that the flavor is pretty bland and just doesn't stand a chance to pho bang (i hate to compare but this is what i am experienced with)  same thing with the spring rolls  it was just crispy and the filling didn't really taste like anything  the only thing is that the restaurant is very clean and aesthetically pleasing but i do not think i will be returning here and i will stick to my original to go place 
i have always seen pictures of a particular pho dishes with a huge bone marrow within  not until now did i find that this dish is found here  i had huge expectations and it sure matched it  the bone marrow really gave the dish a new taste  with only 3 dollars more  it's sure worth the experience  my next dish will definitely be the lobster within the pho 
first time eating at pho best  i ordered spring rolls & pork over rice vermicelli  no bean sprouts or scallions  served on a wooden pedestal box  a tiny bit of vinaigrette and chopsticks i ate part of it for lunch at the restaurant  and the other half for dinner at home  everything  even the vermicelli  had seasoning thus every bite was tasty  however when i was eating the rest for dinner  i wished for plain vermicelli to balance all the flavors  the carrots were pickled  daikon was pickled & slightly spicy  the pickled garlic was edible but not something i enjoyed eating all of  lastly  the seasonings of this entree left an after taste in my mouth that night and the next morning  took two rounds of teeth brushing to get rid of it we also ordered the house special or chef's special calamari  squid is perfectly cooked  it's topped with crispy bits of shallot  sauteed but slightly greasy scallion  a few diced pcs of green pepper and served on bed of fresh crispy lettuce leaves  you have to order this  the perfect bite is squid on top of a lettuce leaf  shallot bits  scallion bits; crispy against texture of perfectly cooked squid = delicious i'll be back though  i want to try the brisket & tendon pho  if i do  that'll be the 2nd photo in my life 
$15 for a whole lobster??? yes please  the only con is that it's extremely hard to get the meat out of the small parts such as the claws  there's a lot of noodle and broth even without the lobster  extremely filling  came early morning on a friday and the waiter made sure to change the dishes often enough so we could get rid of the pieces that were eaten already  there's free dessert too!!! it came out to be $19 after tip and tax  definitely worth it 
located inside arcadia mall  i like how there's a parking lot conveniently located downstairs  what drew to me this place was the lobster pho  whole lobster in my pho! for $14 95 it was not bad  they cracked the shell for you so it wasnt too messy to eat  there's many add ons as well like bone marrow  wings  lambchop  crab patty etc  the lobster pho wasn't as flavorful as the regular beef one  but i still enjoyed it  generous portions  lots of noodles  staff was great and also gave us free dessert  was it the best pho i've ever had   no but it warmed my stomach on a very cold winter day 
pho soup wasn't great or bad  it was ok  it tasted a little like the soup stock out of a can  of course as a vietnamese person  bad pho is very obvious to me  this place wasn't bad  wasn't amazing  i came for the bone marrow addition to the pho and that was definitely worth it  the price is more reasonable than ginger and lemongrass for a bowl of bone marrow pho (although you do get what you ask for in terms of soup quality)  i add a lot of sriracha and lemon to my pho anyway so this place was fine for me  good piece of marrow too! place was a one and done for me  i encourage you to try it for the bone marrow pho!
this place is tucked away in arcadia mall in flushing   the menu is extensive and is a good value for the amount of food you receive  especially the lobster pho (a whole lobster!) and the large pho bowl which you can add bone marrow for an additional $3  i've had better pho  but the prices can't be beat for what you're getting 
two words  lobster pho  this place is a gem for vietnamese food in the heart of flushing  i haven't been able to find any really good viet food around my area for a long time but this will now be my go to spot  the price is incredible for both the amount the get and the flavor profile  the lobster pho was massive and pre cracked (thank goodness) making it easy to eat and enjoy  the broth was simple but flavorful and the noodles were aldente  the wait staff even helped me mix the sweet bean drink (i was afraid of spilling the beans  i know thats dumb but it's delicious and did not want to waste a single bean)  and they gave a free complimentary dessert  gelatin with sweet corn which was light and refreshing  i can't wait to try more and more of their menu!
the bone marrow really peaked my interest so i had to try it while i was in the neighborhood overall giving it a 4 star rating service was great  they were courteous  accommodating  and promptly refilled our tea when it was low  they also offer a tasty complimentary dessert which is always a plus food   we each ordered #1 with a side of marrow  the bone marrow was the real reason we visit this placed  overall the pho was good  the broth is clear and flavorful  noodles and meat serving portions were generous  it was definitely a great value item  the side of bone marrow was confusing though  not sure why they recommend the pairing  they are both goodby itself  but together they do not work well  it's like having apple juice with butter  the pairing doesn't work  i would have preferred the bone marrow to have been offered with some bread instead location decor   the restaurant is located inside a shopping center  it has an opened pass thru to the mall  which takes away the feeling of being inside a restaurant and it feels more like being in a food court  i would suggest adding another glass panel to create a separation between the restaurant and the mall in all  i do suggest the pho but don't pair with the bone marrow 
if you are looking for traditional pho  this isn't the place for you  they have creative take on pho  but it still can't beat the pho bang restaurants  i got the lobster pho  and the only thing that tasted good was the lobster  their broth is really bad and that's the most important part about eating pho  the spring rolls weren't crunchy and the service was not so good 
after seeing the reviews  i had really high expectations for this place  however  considering the overwhelming reviews i was  well  underwhelmed  the service was good; the staff was polite and attentive  i ordered the beef brisket and tendon pho  shrimp summer roll  and the three colored drink  when they brought out the drink i wanted to laugh aloud  was this a joke? literally over half of the cup was filled with ice and then at the very bottom was a wee bit of the beans and jelly  i don't like being confrontational in restaurants so i just went with it  i scooped out all of the excess ice onto a plate  and the plate was definitely full with the amount of ice they provided  when the pho arrived i was pleased with the generous portion  i don't really have complaints with the pho  but it wasn't really anything special  it was pretty okay average  they could have given a bit more bean sprouts considering the size of the soup  but that's a minor detail  the summer rolls were good  i enjoyed them  the complimentary dessert was nice too  and tasted good  if i was in the area and craved some pho  this place would definitely satiate that  but i don't think i would go out of my way to come here again  (i'm still a bit irritated by that joke of a drink they served me) 
i was craving pho and i had read all the reviews on yelp  and i was craving pho the restaurant is on the second floor  and has a bit of a food court feel (out in the open) with other stores surrounding it i came in for a pho and the broth was very good! (the bone marrow isn't worth the money)  service was standard (took a while for them to come to my table though) the pho was good  but there's nothing substancial that makes this place a special visit 
this review calls for more of a 3 5 stars because the place emphasize more on quantity than on quality  so i've been waiting to try this place since it first opened  i love viet food and was so excited to try it considering everyone was raving about it and they opened up a second location on prince sheet  after actually trying it  i was a little disappointed  first off  this place is actually owned and operated by fuzhounese people (no one is really viet here)  yes  the big bowl is huge and can probably feed 2 people  hell  the regular bowl was even too big for me  however  i felt like the broth could have been a bit more flavorful and warmer (it was weird that it came out lukewarm)  regardless  i was so full at the end of the meal and the owner was very generous and gave out free desserts  plus  pricing is very reasonable consider the amount of food you get (mostly noodles though)  +$3 for a bone marrow and $15 for an entire lobster with pho is a steal!!! i didn't order the lobster but it looked delicious 
inexpensive and large portions!definitely a fan of the shrimp sitting rolls! they were fried to perfection! food came out quickly and service was very efficient  the place looks clean  definitely come here hungry  the lobster pho was enough to feed the both of us  a $20 dinner for two? i'm in!  complimentary dessert was a nice touch although we are still confused on what it was  will definitely come back 
the pho with grilled  bone marrow is to die!! casual soup place or regular night dine out! not recommended for special dates thou!
recently opened inside of arcadia mall   you'll see a grand opening sign for it at the main entrance  would have never heard about this place if not for some friends who'd been and suggested it service was good  one of the waiters came over and helped us with our vietnamese iced coffees (most likely to prevent us from accidentally breaking the drip filters haha)   the lid goes on the bottom to stop the drippage  recommended if you like your coffee sweet! make sure you finish stirring the coffee with the condensed milk while it's hot before pouring it into the glass of ice  another waiter made sure to refill our water  which was served in mason jars! the pitcher was infused with either basil or mint from what i saw  at the end of our meal  we were given complimentary dessert  food came out pretty quickly  i liked that the pho was served on wooden trays and that they included a small dish for if you wanted any hoisin sriracha sauce on the side (some places don't provide a sauce tray unless you ask)  you can add bone marrow to your pho for additional $3 00  there's also a lobster pho option for ~$15 00  i stuck to the fresh rib eye  tendon  brisket  & tripe pho ($8 25)  comes in a larger size for an additional dollar  but the regular size was large enough  reasonable pricesoverall  not the "pho best" i've had  it was decent  but not great  i've eaten pho in vietnam and have had tons of homemade pho before though  so i'm definitely biased  friend who'd been there on another occasion said it was off the day we went  so i guess i'll just have to come back and see 
this is one of my go to spots when i'm in the mood for some vietnamese soup noodles  it is located on main street inside the arcadia mall so you can easily miss this place you aren't looking carefully  i love their add on options to your bowl of noodles! my favorite is the bone marrow which i always get with lobster pho  this delicious bowl of goodness is also great for hangovers  some people go for greasy grilled cheese sandwiches and burgers      i go for soup  )
okay  so usually any store or restaurant that has the word "best" in it would turn me off  however  given the positive reviews i figured why the heck not    especially after seeing there is bone marrow! we had to wait about 15 20 minutes for a table for two adults and a stroller  it was surprisingly busier than i had anticipated and there was even a small queue  the options on the menu were vast and everything sounds so delicious  however we decided to order the signature dishes at a typical vietnamese restaurant  we ordered the vietnamese crispy spring rolls and of course pho  i added bone marrow to my pho order as well  the ingredients of the springs appeared to be very fresh  flavors were good  it was not crispy but soggy which was a shame  all the reviews about the portion size of the pho is no joke    they are unnecessarily huge! i love large portions and i eat a lot  but this was pure madness  the pho were rather tasty   not the best i've had  but not bad either  just average  the bone marrow was very sad  the bone itself was large but the amount of marrow was minuscule  i felt ripped off as it definitely is not worth the extra $3  service was efficient and friendly  we even got a free coconut dessert to share at the end 
yes! got my pho best without the long line! got the bone marrow pho  my sisters got the whole lobster pho  the broth is very good for both the lobster and marrow pho  the regular size bowl is plenty of food and will more than fill you up  but for the truly hungry there is a large bowl  do yourself a favor and stick with the regular bowl  the service was excellent  and handled our large party of 6 easily 
first thing first  this place is very clean (so far)  service is phenomenal  the waiter that we had was very patient and gave us time to look at the menu unlike other pho restaurant near the area where they would just sit you down and immediate ask what you want  the pho was pretty standard  nothing stood out asides from the broth being very light and them giving you a hefty amount of food   you can tell the chef cooks spent time preparing and cooking 
we wanted to try this place since there aren't any good viet restaurants in queens and it is fairly new  i love trying new restaurants before they get filled with patrons and the wait gets ridiculous  plus with a newborn in tow  a clean place is definitely a plus! first impression is that the plates and utensils are huge! and the meal prices are pretty cheap  for a giant bowl of pho  and i mean big  it will set you back $9! that's a steal!!! i dunno many places that i can get a dinner meal for that price  and they provide a complimentary coconut dessert  we ordered the lobster pho (had to try it after seeing all the yelp photos) and the grilled lamb chops  we were disappointed that the lamb chops didn't come with rice  the dish was overly salty so rice was definitely needed  the pho broth was just ok  it needed more depth  but for $15 to get a whole lobster?!?! i think that's a steal! it def satisfy my lobster cravings  next time i wanna try their regular pho with ribeye  overall i would def come back cause it's cheap! your money will go a long way at this restaurant  our bill came out to be $34    which includes lobster pho  grilled lamb  and viet coffee! fancy date night at a low budget viet restaurant lol
came on a wednesday night and ordered a spider summer roll and classic beef pho  it was quite empty and the food came pretty fast the broth was light and not too salty  the spider roll was a unique twist on the traditional summer roll  but i still prefer it with shrimp they did mess up on my order by sending the wrong summer roll  but other than that  it's a nice pho spot 
nice little spot in the arcadia mall  i love a menu that doesn't have an overwhelming amount of options  i ordered a regular small pho  which is by no means a small portion   which is a good thing  it's great for solo dining  they also throw in a free dessert (kind of a coconut custard)  i'm going back 
good with large portions for the cost  this is definitely one of those places you're looking to get satisfied on the cheap rather than look for an amazing meal  still worth a repeat 
a stop that you wouldn't expect in this little mall!i didn't even know it existed there   the service and food was great! it does have bone marrow pho and it wasn't an arm and a leg to add it   we even added pork chops on the side   we did split some of the appetizers like the grilled squid and the mixed platter!  the bowls are also huge  a lot of us ended up splitting our bowls with another friend i would check it out again and try some of their other food =)as always check and like my instagram jliueats and check the photos i always post
good portion for a very fair price  came with tea and dessert with the meal  came in with a jacket and walked out with a t shirt  the broth hits the soul  $5 parking all around   friendly staff  missing the condiment section for the sauce and the menu is different from the phone place i'm use to from back in the days but i feel like thats what scared alot of customers away  most of my friends i brought to pho spots would ask me to make the sauce for them  definitely recommend this place 
while this is not the best pho i've had  it's one of the better pho places in nyc  we ordered the shrimp summer roll  shrimp spring roll and pho #1 with the bone marrow for an extra $3  and pho #2  the dipping sauce for the summer roll had more of a tang which resembled that of a salad dressing  it wasn't bad but i prefer the usual  more peanut flavored dipping sauce  the shrimp spring roll was very fresh and tasty  pho #1 and #2 are essentially the same except in size  #1 is the large while #2 is the regular size  the regular size is enough to fill you up if you're also ordering appetizers  skip the bone marrow  not worth the extra $3  it didn't really have any flavor to it and the texture was off since it was served lukewarm  the soup was rich in flavor but didn't come out steaming hot as i usually prefer since there's raw beef  which btw was tender and fresh  didn't taste like rubber beef slices as you might find at some pho places in the city  overall  i would come back here  the food is reasonably priced and the portion size is decent  ambience is casual and service is average  no complaints 
conveniently located in the heart of flushing  pho best seems to be one of the restaurants i find myself defaulting to when i can't decide on what to eat  prices are decent considering the portion of the dishes and sweet baby jesus i loveeee that they have bone marrow! this place's really began to grow on me and now i can't stop going back (help)  the only thing i have a problem with is the broth  it doesn't taste very authentic  it seems to be missing the rich  woody aroma that many vietnamese pho bowls have 
the employee are super nice and their food are amazing  the store looks aesthetically pleasing to the eyes  the way the food is placed and the experiment here is so different from any other pho place in flushing  the rainbow ice drink is delicious also their coffee  they don't add any msg and try's to get the freshest ingredients! they serve you water in a mason jar  which is so cute! the water is infused with lemon or lime and i believe mint but i maybe wrong! it's a great spot for family and friends or just yourself alone  )i forgot to add they make the dessert themselves and it taste amazing!!
compared to a lot of places in flushing  the service here was on point  the waiters and waitresses were polite and always made sure you didnt wait on anything  we ordered the vermicelli platter and the pho with bone marrow   because we do it for the ig  the bone marrow is a one time thing for me  in my opinion  it made the pho a little too oily for me  the soup was also not hot enough for me when it was brought out in front of us   i felt like the meat and beansprouts couldnt really cook in there  flavor wise   it was on point  i really enjoyed the spring rolls there compared to many of the vietnamese places i have been to in flushing 
my first time trying this place  i ordered a carry out of pho dac biet  grilled pork vermicelli and grilled chicken on rice  overall  all 3 dishes were good  but more salty than what i am used to  especially  the grilled meats  notable pro's  fast service  friendly staff  well spoken friendly receptionist  food is good (not the best  no pun intended)  reasonable pricing  decor is ok  notable con's  location (inside a mall  not easy to find  not as simple like a traditional store front)  food was salty 
since pho32 was gone in flushing  it's been hard to find good comparable pho place around   nothing's been aunthentic  except the one in kissena  but you dont want to dine there where there's no ambience and service sucks  finally found pho best  now theres someplace to go when im cravjng good vietnamese pho   price is affordable  good service  pho is good  but 4 star bc its still not as good as pho32 
this place was surprisingly delicious and modern   it gave me a nostalgic feeling as i sat down   the atmosphere and the unique kinds of food pho best offered reminded of this fancy pho place i visited in quincy  ma! the table next to us ordered a whole lobster with pho and it was very appealing  however  my girlfriend and i decided to split a large bowl of pho   the broth here was very interesting and not like other pho restaurants we been to   it was way more flavorful and the broth was also a little more oily than the traditional kind of pho broth   i have to say that the meats that they used was very fresh and i enjoyed it quite a lot   if i didn't already have dinner  i would have ordered two bowls just because of how delicious it was   the service was really nice as well   i enjoyed how they were very attentive to their patrons   we were also given some complementary coconut pudding as dessert so that was also nice!
had the spring roll  summer roll  beef pho  and lobster pho  everything was good  except for the summer roll  they used thousand island as their sauce  super weird  i would come back but i had better in flushing 
i've been to quite a few places for pho and this place has to have been the best! the food looked great  tasted awesome  was clean  didn't hit my wallet too hard and showed great hospitality!my fiancé got the pho big bowl and it was much bigger than her head  immediately she said  "when they said 'big bowl' they really meant 'big bowl!'"we got pork chops to share (ended up just taking it home because we couldn't even finish our own entreé's  usually  in other vietnamese restaurants we would need to order a little extra  extra ) i got the spring roll and grilled beef rice vermicelli and that tasted great too! it came out in a really nice bowl as well  they also gave free dessert! coconut pudding with bits of sweet potato  it tasted great!my fiancé and i will definitely come back!
good food  terrible service  ordered raw beef pho with bone marrow  then a 2nd serving of bone marrow came cold   waiter's response was "you should've said something earlier" well i didn't feel the need until i felt nauseous  congrats you lost a customer over $3
my experience here is always great! their pho proportions are huge and i love it! my first time here was about a month ago and i had the lobster pho because i saw the reviews and it was pretty great  this time i had the brisket pho with the bone marrow and it was great  the noodles weren't soggy and were just the right kind of soft  their soup base is amazing although maybe for some people it may be salty but i love it  their viet spring rolls were amazing as well  this might be my go to for pho
i love pho so i always want to try our new places for pho  after reading all the good reviews  i wanted to try this place!! however  definitely a disappointment the broth isn't rich like most pho places  it actually tastes pretty bland  there are not that much meat and the service is only mediocre 3 10 would come back again
this place is   fast friendly  and cheap love it  the chicken pho was delicious  deff one of the place i would go to again 
i really enjoyed the pho here  the service is honestly very bad but really  the food is great i disregarded it  when i come to restaurants  service is a great deal for me because it brings mood for eating & a good impression  however  this place had such good pho i barely paid mind to it
omg this place is to die for! came here after all the hype and i can understand what the hype is all about  it's so good! i ordered the big bowl of pho with all the meats and it's better than your regular pho and less sodium and msg added too  my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon cubes over rice and it came in a huge portion and it was delicious  the best part is that it's relatively cheap and not crazy expensive  overall  i think all the prices are decent and fair  you get a lot for what you pay for  lastly  free dessert in the end with every meal!
decided to try finally this spot with my sis  i was surprised that this spot actually took over the previous restaurant that was there (it was called chin chin cheese ribs or something like that  but i liked it) the servers were all very nice and attentive  we both ordered the regular pho  and it came out extremely fast  questionably fast  that being said  the pho was not warm as i would imagine  and i like my noodles warm  besides that  the pho was good but nothing extraordinary  they'll also give you a complimentary dessert at the end which i thought was pretty cute 
this place is great! highly recommend the pho and the vermacilli! can't wait to come back to try the lobster pho
i came across this place because of the snow storm and really wanted a pho  trying out this new place  i will definitely ask my friends to come here instead  the place is cozy  quite  clean and comfortable  the price is at the right range  the size of the bowl is very satisfacting 
had occasion to try this with wifey recently   interesting space in one of those mini flushing malls within a commercial building   service was prompt   wifey ordered curry dish with side salad and i ordered one of their vermicelli platters   they didn't have any of the sandwiches on the menu  which was a bit of a let down because they looked interesting  but i digress   food arrived quickly despite the place being pretty packed   both our dishes were decent at best   hate to say it  but it tasted like cheap mall food court food   imitation ingredients  not fresh  bland and the spring rolls tasted like they were microwaved and added to dish   overall  we ate and concluded it was a seriously underwhelming experience food wise   wifey asked the woman at the table next to her what she was eating  as it looked pretty good  and the woman said it was not good at all and that wifey should not bother trying it this would have been a 3 star review  as i recognize that tastes vary  and the service  as well as the prices  were entirely reasonable   however  wifey and i barely made it home before she got violently ill   she was seriously sick for 2 full days  and it too almost a week for her to eat relatively normal again   we resolved that it was her salad  which did not taste right and it was the only thing i did not touch (i tried her curry)   also  it was the only time she ate that day  which kind of narrows down the suspected origin of her illness   i am no longer allowed to pick new places to try because of pho best while this was likely a food preparation handling error  it still happened and cost them a star   we will not be returning  ever if you want excellent vietnamese food that is far more fresh  authentic and delicious  travel a bit farther out of downtown flushing and head over to  mekong15632 northern blvd  flushing  ny 11354we have been there many  many times and never had a bad experience   food is consistently outstanding  and our experience at pho worst made us appreciate how awesome it really is 
very flavorful   priced very reasonable  great service and the place is very clean   inside a mini mall  
service was great! came in with my little cousins who was causing a ruckus but the waitress was so kind and accommodating  we ordered a beef noodle soup with bone marrow  steak dish  and wings  we were told that they gave us an extra bone marrow since one of them was so small which was very considerate of them  i would only suggest that they serve the food hotter in terms of temperature but it was still so tasty! i'm sure they would have no issues if i were to tell them to warm it up more  i would definitely come again 
the best pho ever!!! very courteous  attentive and friendly  2 of us were comfortably seated at a table for four which we were very thankful for 
new spot in flushing for viet food  i have to say that i was expecting better  we ordered the soft shell crab summer rolls  bone marrow pho  and a grilled pork chop with pork crab patty over rice  the pho came out first (after about 10 minutes) and was the best dish of all  broth was deep in flavor and piping hot  just how it's supposed to be  big bone full of marrow but it seemed a little lacking in flavor  just because they charred it  doesn't make it automatically good  big portion so you won't leave hungry  the soft shell crab summer roll followed about 15 minutes later  nothing special and the peanut sauce definitely does not pair well with the crab  maybe it's just me? now my pork chop and rice dish  why it took an additional 20 minutes to come to the table is beyond me  i was expecting something hot and super impressive but was underwhelmed by the cold everything on the plate  it was also a bit hard to communicate with the waitstaff so i just decided to eat it since i was already starving  this place has taught me that even though my favorite pho place is ghetto looking and a little out of the way  that i shouldn't be easily swayed because this place has fancier decor  never again will i sway again  back to ghetto pho i go! sorry not sorry 
they have lobster pho for 14 95! say what?! it's a whole lobster too! it's less than a pound but hey it's still a great price! they crack it open for you still you really don't have to work that hard  how can you go wrong? but wait there's still more! they have bone marrow too! it's a $3 add on but worth it  the have 2 sizes for pho  the large for $9 95 plus bone marrow makes it $12 95 which is pretty affordable compared to other places  run don't walk  this place is amazing! it's inside the arcadia mall and you'll have to use the bathroom downstairs but who cares! the pho is great and affordable!
great addition of vietnamese restaurants in ny  great location as it's off the main area of main street so parking is easier  free metered parking after 7pm  service is quick and friendly  cleanliness could be better though  started with the fried shrimp rolls which were amazing! perfectly fried and great flavor  giant shrimps too! also had the summer rolls which were good  the dipping sauce is different from the standard as it has more of a vinaigrette ish sauce but still worked well  my wife had the pho which was huge for a standard size  broth wise was good but the not the best  i had the bbq beef vermicelli bowl which may be one of the best i had in ny  beef had lots of flavor and wrapped with a baby onion in the middle which was great  the bowl had more of a variety of condiments in it which was a nice touch  loved the baby onions in it! they gave us a free dessert which was a corn pudding cake  everything was great  we'll be back!
i was sent to flushing for work for 3 weeks   i always enjoy finding little gems to experience   pho is just that   i have already been here 3x  cleanest restaurant you will find   service has always been great as well   i ordered the chicken pho each time  delicious  filling and just the right amount of spice and flavorful   it could use just a little more chicken but otherwise is great 
hey this place pho best should be called pho worst  this is the worse pho i've ever been to in my life  they make absolutely the worse pho ever when i got my pho it was a huge chunk of noodles all stuck together and the soup was not even warm    it looked like food i left out for hours and the soup had fat floating on top of it  when you order pho you expect your soup to be hot or at least warm enough to cook the raw meat that they give  how do you expect the raw meat you give me to cook in barely warm soup???? worst pho i've ever ate at 
this is my favorite vietnamese place in downtown flushing  modern decoration  great broth and giant bowl of noodles with a reasonable price 
this spot is very similar to ginger and lemongrass   pretty sure they took their ideas from them  it's amazing  it's a bit cheaper and tastes very healthy and delicious!! no msg added   i'm not crazy about pho  but this is the best pho in all of flushing for sure! their meat is better quality as well  definitely get the bone marrow in your pho! they give you a coconut jelly type dessert when you get the check 
i want to give this place 3 5  i ordered the pho with the bone marrow  the soup was pretty good but the marrow felt too small  there was a good amount of beef  tendon and tripe  i liked there wasn't a lot of onions  beef could be a little rarer  i also had the vietnamese spring roll  it was a good side  the con was is not crispy enough and the filing was off  flavors were there but the texture was not expected  bright side  got a complimentary coconut pudding for dessert 
came here on a saturday night with a friend after seeing all the great reviews on yelp  took us forever to find parking so i'd say to take the bus or try to walk it if you can  main street is alwayss difficult for parking  got a little lost trying to find the place since it is inside of a mini mall but as soon as we got in the mall  you couldn't miss it  as for the food  we got a brisket pho  a lemongrass chicken plate  a vietnamese drip coffee and a tea w condensed milk  i eat pho at least once a week and i could honestly say i wanted to love this place but the broth was a little bland and lack luster for me  the chicken plate was tasty  i'd probably come back for the pork chop next time  the best thing about this place overall is the service  the hostess  servers and waitress were all beyond sweet  helpful and attentive  the food itself was a 3 5 but the service and such low cost bumped it to a 4 
first of all  the food was picture worthy  i came here because a friend had really nice pics of the food at pho best  the service was 2 stars because they forgot our order and took way to long for the lobster pho  waited about 30min while the bone marrow and the beef pho came out right away  the food was pretty bland and one of the bone marrows had nothing in it  was like eating a bone  the clams had a really eww after taste  and had sand in them  overall i wouldnt come here again  but it was a good experience 
located inside arcadia mall next to dumpling galaxy  this is a new pho spot and yes  it is good  the crispy shrimp spring roll is perfectly crispy and the size was decently big  highly recommend this one  the grilled pork chop over rice tastes exactly like the one at pho bang (my favorite pho place in flushing)  and we got a large pho to share and it is massive  so beware  the broth is great but the flavor could be a tad bit stronger  and at the end  they gave us cake as a free dessert! we really enjoyed this place and would come here again  i'm happy that there's a new spot for pho in flushing 
the place is located inside of a small chinese mall  the service was alright but not the best  the waitress serving us didn't speak much english  i had the lobster pho  however it wasn't anything amazing like the reviews 
they got an a+ for decor  cleanliness  and service   the food was similar to other vietnamese restaurants   the price was slightly higher but i don't mind paying the extra $ for cleaner food 
came here on a friday night at dinner time  right when we arrived we were seated right away  there was no wait and service was excellent  the atmosphere of this place was very clean and modern unlike the other vietnamese restaurants in flushing  a big plus since the sauce bottles were not sticky  we ordered a lobster pho  a number 2 pho noodle with bone marrow and vietnamese spring rolls  most of the food came out quick however they had to get the lobster from somewhere else so it took about 15 mins for the lobster pho  the soup base was not as rich and flavorful as other vietnamese restaurants in flushing but the bone marrow made up for it  the lobster pho was delicious  they use a beef broth base and a fresh whole lobster  food was delicious and price was inexpensive ($8 25 for the #2 pho +$3 for bone marrow and 14 95 for lobster pho) 
food is great pho big bowl is huge the shrimp roll was very good 
i tried this place out twice and was not disappointed  their quality is definitely outstanding compared to other pho places in places  such as pho bang (the dirtiest place ever lol)  the raw beef is really tender and soft  the broth is nice and clean  the staff is friendly and speaks decent english  i love their spring rolls and shrimp spring rolls  really great texture  the spring roll is chewy and crunch highly recommend!
got a notice from yelp about this new restaurant  read the reviews and was very excited to give it a try   vietnamese is one of favorite cuisine   we ordered fried spring rolls  salt and pepper squid  brisket and tendon pho  fresh rib eye and beef stew pho  bulaclac  pork chops and filet mignon rice vermicelli   first off  customer service was great   we were seated right away   food  spring rolls were just ok salt and pepper squid for $8 95 was very very small portion but it was also tasteless  brisket n tendon was ok the broth was not as tasty as i would have liked  beef stew was not what i was expecting   i've ordered beef stew in other vietnamese restaurants n it's normally chunks of meat with thicker broth   this one was just the same thinly slice meat and clear broth  pork chop was very chewy   it was even hard to cut it up with steak knife  bulaclac was tender but not as tasty or flavorful  filet mignon rice vermicelli was good but i the meat could be more flavorful to sum up  besides the salt and pepper squid all the dishes were generous portions   presentation of the dishes was very nice   all the dishes definitely not flavorful for my taste but i did read somewhere that they don't use msg?!  so maybe i'm not use to eating this healthy but i'm can't imagine that the lack of flavor is all due to that one ingredient   prices are also very reasonable but i don't think i will go back 
i was drawn to this place because there was pho lobster and that was different  the price was also not too bad and for what you got seem to be worth it  we started with the vietnamese spring roll which was just okay  we were more interested in the main dishes but when it came  i was somewhat disappointed since the pho just taste like any other pho but with a lobster  the broth was okay as well  didn't have any lobster taste to it  i felt that my lobster was over cooked and very bland tasting  it also got very annoying to try and get all the lobster meat out  but the thing i did appreciate was that they cracked some parts of the lobster for us  my friend ordered the regular pho with bone marrow (extra $3)  the beef itself in the regular pho wasn't bad  i am not sure if the bone they gave us was just not as juicy in marrow as other people's but only half of the bone was filled  the rest was pretty much just bone  our food cooled down really quickly and we left questioning whether or not we would go back again to try the food 
new pho spot in flushing  nothing different from the ordinary pho  but the add on bone marrow was pretty good and the broth wasn't so watered down  the waiters didn't speak much english   but food is universal   right? will definitely come back 
taste is very close to the authentic pho bang soup base   there is only one size to the pho ( large )   but the ribeye was fresh  we also tried the spider spring roll which you dip in a light peanut sauce   pretty much a summer roll with fried soft shell crabs  
not bad  finally you got one fresh and tasty pho in flushing  i hope it can survives longer so we can come back again 
nothing special other than they make it more presentable than regular pho spots  i ordered the bone marrow pho and they forgot the bone marrow  soup base was extremely salty  my friend ordered an ice tea and they forgot that until he asked again after we already finished the meal  don't order the "crunchy" spring rolls  they're straight up ass and soggy as f*** 
the staff are friendly and helpful  this place is a really good bang for the bug as the portion is big  the place is modern  clean  and not very noisy  i'd love to be back 
pho was really good and tasted extremely fresh considering we were there at nearly closing  staff was extremely friendly and very accommodating as i wanted the brisket and rib eye   as wasn't on the menu  free dessert at the end was a huge plus  and on top delicious 
tried soft shell  spring roll and ph with lobster    the soup kinda kill the sweetness of the lobster  and the lobster made the soup cool down too fast when they bring it to the table  and no meatball? the peanut dipping sauce for the soring rolls is too sour  no balance in term of flavors  presentation  8   food  5
excited to finally try a new spot to eat pho  located right on main street in a cozy corner of arcadia mall  my girlfriend and i came here on a friday night around 7pm  it was pretty crowded and we can see how popular this new place was already  the restaurant appears very clean and modern  they first bring you ice water in little jars  at first we thought there was something odd in the water until they told us it was lemon water  when we got the menus  the price for this place is definitely low $  comparable to pho bang on main  my gf ordered a regular beef pho and i got the grilled beef pho  we also ordered shrimp spring rolls  and an order of grilled pork chops that came in 3 pieces for $7 wow  it was super juicy and tasty  not overly dry or burnt  shrimp rolls were each filled with a  large shrimp and super crispy on the outside  when the grilled beef pho finally came  it had a good presentation and came in a large portion  the grilled pieces of beef were on the side and the noodle soup was lukewarm  bland and sour  because this is a new pho spot the soup needs more work  i did not get the urge to finish all the noodles because the soup was just not that good  after being used to years of soup from pho bang and trying another popular place madam vo in the city where the soups are the star of the show  i will definitely need to come back here in a few months to try the pho again for improvements 
this spot is not too bad  portions size definitely on the bigger end and the rice dishes come w a salad which is dope  is it better than pho bang tho     depending on what you craving  a little more variety  i'll say here  but if you want the og pho  pho bang all the way 
this place was well hidden as it's inside a building and not just a store in the open  their pho tastes better than average given the flushing area  the portions are fairly large  if you're ordering noodle soup  i'd highly recommend adding bone marrow  it really enhances the soup flavor  one small problem is that the store is near a barber shop or hair salon  and i unluckily got a table that was near it  so i lept getting whiffs of hair products and such  the restaurant also didn't give our table water  which i'm assuming they forgot  because no restaurant anywhere doesn't give water 
a cute well kept spot inside a mall  i didn't expect that it  still a nice place to eat  i had the pho with bone marrow  so good  i ordered another  the staff was pleasant  i enjoyed it very much 
delicious pho! good broth and the meat was tender  portion is good and price is inexpensive  would definitely recommend if craving pho in flushing 
this is the best pho i had in years!  i got the brisket and ribeye large pho for $9 25 ; they gave plenty of meat  i counted six slices of brisket and 6 large slices of rib eye that was medium well pink  the broth had pronounced star anise flavor which is great i think       i also asked for more basil and they were not hesitant at all to provide it        great customer service  i would highly recommend this place for anyone who craves pho 
to be honest  i had high expectations for this place after reading the reviews but i was dissapointed after my meal  we order the #2 pho which is the medium sized pho and a pork chop rice  the ambience is very nice but the quality of the food wasn't that great  the meat for the pho was already cooked and the broth was on the salty side  for the pork chop  it came out brunt and there was more fatty to it than lean meat  the pork chop also came out too salty  but what i really liked about this place was the free dessert that they gave at the end  i think i'll just stick with pho bang which is also a lot cheaper!
i actually found this place as i was looking up another flushing restaurant  the food and reviews looked good so we ventured to pho best in the middle of the slight snow storm ny had recently  the restaurant is in arcadia mall  and it is a few blocks away from main street  we got 2 appetizers  the crispy spring shrimp rolls and spider summer rolls  the shrimp in the spring rolls were really good  but the crispy skin didn't work  i don't know but the skin was off  i really liked the summer rolls dipped in fish sauce  i don't like peanut sauce so i tend to use fish sauce for dipping  we also got 2 vietnamese dripped iced coffee drinks  and it was okay  i don't know what it was  but it didn't taste strong enough  which i always enjoy whenever i do go to vietnamese restaurants for entrees  we got pho with brisket & tendon and the grilled pork chop with shredded pork  egg crab patty and rice  the pho was huge and it was a small since they had an medium option  i was so full from the appetizers  that i only got a few bites  but the broth and the brisket were flavorful  and that's all you need  at least for me  i didn't enjoy the tendon too much  but there was definitely plenty so if you do  you're in for a treat  my boyfriend had the grilled pork chop and he said it was well cooked  but the egg crab patty wasn't enjoyable  i actually had a piece too and didn't like it either   the restaurant itself was clean and the staff were friendly  so if you're in the area  it's worth the visit 
since they opened up we been there multiple times already! food is great and the price is very reasonable  staff are friendly and bonus points for the free dessert at the end!
must try big bowl of vietnamese noodle! it's really a big bowl with very delicious soup! the waitress are very nice  a waitress recommended me shrimp spring roll  it's really crispy and yummy! also they gave us some free small cakes at the end  definitely will come back again!
i love this place so much  their food is amazing and their service is wonderful  they even serve you coconut pudding after each meal! great viet food and pricing is decent as well 
this place is clean and their pho is really good! it comes in large portion even to go! i got plenty of noodles and beef! i also got their summer rolls  which is really good! it was worth it  and i have noticed​ that this place is really clean  staff is very friendly and also this is perfect for cold weather!
on a cold night is nothing better than a warm bowl of vietnamese lobster pho this is my first time here great little restaurant wonderful selection of beef or lobster pho really enjoyed the bone marrow and the crab roll appetizer looking forward to returning
pho best is really the best! really great food and service  it's obvious they're all hard working  totally recommend and defiantly going to go back again 
i would give zero star if i could  worst restaurant in the world~ i was eating at a restaurant last night and a waitress accidentally spilled a drink (rainbow ice drink) on my lap  not even a single person from the restaurant come over to apologize  they didn't offer to dry my pants with a hair dryer  they only comped my drink and clean up the floor  over an hour after the incident  because it was the middle of winter and having to go out into the cold with wet pants  never going back! avoid this restaurant!
their pho is good but the broth could have been more fragrant and flavorful  noodles and brisket were really good  portions are huge for a regular bowl  for $8 25 you definitely get your money's worth  the free mini dessert is a nice touch  fyi this place is run by chinese people who may speak vietnamese but i all heard was mandarin and cantonese 
upgraded pho   fancy  i love to get it with bone marrow  it made the soup creamier (and more cholesterol)  in additional; presentation and service  compare to other pho  this place is slightly pricey  but more meats we visited few days after opening  we are hoping that they can keep the quality the same 
this was a great experience overall  the best part was the lobster pho  i was hesitant at first to order it because i wasn't sure if i was going to get quality lobster  but the lobster they served was packed with meat and noodles were very good!! and they also gave everyone free delicious coconut pudding dessert with some yellow beans in them  however  i can only give them 4 stars because the spring rolls were not that good  i wouldn't order their spring rolls again but would go back for the lobster pho and the coconut pudding 
great food and very friendly waiters the best pho in town very clean and presentable 
we have been coming since it first opened   delish vietnamese food and the flavors and quality are always consistent   we ordered the grilled shrimp vermicelli noodle and hubby had the curry chicken baguette 
i had #1 which is pho with basically everything in it   tendon  tripe  brisket and ect    also got the fried crispy shrimp and vegetable summer roll   the vegetable summer roll was really good   i would say it is in the top 5 that i have tried so far   the shrimp roll was nice and crispy but it was also greasy   but you can tell it is clean oil   not the reussed oil  so that was a plus   however after you eat 2 piece  you just can't eat anymore unless you are the type that like greasy food   as for the pho   not the best i've tried but not the worst   as few people said  it i decent for the price   it is a place you would go if you were near there or passing by  but not good enough to go out of your way to get the pho   also  that being said   make sure you eat there   do not do take out   when you eat there  the portion is much larger than when you take it home   it is about 1 3 less when you do a take out for pho   so best to just eat it there 
the rib eye is so meltingly tender (good quality meat) and with large portions  they provide service with a smile  the broth has a bit more anise than i would like but it was open on christmas  would come back 
the most authentic vietnamese restaurant in flushing  and their price is reasonable 
called to place an order for a pho pick up  lady with heavy accent picks up and first thing i hear is  no derrrivery    i said okay   i want to pick up and asked how long should i come by in she screamed  #how wrong?? twuu minutt"  chinese lady was very rude and unprofessional  i hope the pho makes up for rude customer service 
it's first time here   im sure will bring friends come  nice and clean  the soup tastes good 
i saw this vietnamese food from wecgat moment everyone say here is best pho in flushing so i came and try was unbelievedable so love the noodle soup i order with a bone marrow taste so good high recommand come try out and they give free dessert
new pho restaurant that is relatively close to the og places in flushing  pho bang and pho hoang  there's definitely more of a modern vibe that will definitely get the younger crowd with the more "instagramable" aesthetic look to the food  they still have the traditional menu items but also has a slight twist with options such as the lobster and bone marrow pho  i got the brisket pho  viet spring rolls and viet iced coffee  they also gave a complimentary dessert (jelly i believe?) at the end  food was yummy and comparable to pho bang (personally think pho bang is slight more flavorful  but not a huge difference)  what i really appreciate is that even tho the place gives more of a "hipster" and modern vibe  they didn't jack up their prices and attempt to rip us off  they have very reasonable prices  also with my obsession with viet spring rolls  love the fact that they have a small and large option  p the staff there were quick  efficient and friendly and the place itself is super clean (didn't feel the rush to order the minute i sit down like at pho bang lol)  nice new pho place to check out!
the brisket pho with the bone marrow was pretty good but they really need to change the description of their "spider summer roll " i thought it would be made with crab meat because it said so in the description but it was actually one whole soft shell crab cut into four pieces for the four piece summer roll appetizer  needless to say  i did not eat it  also  i started getting terrible stomach cramps about three to four hours after this dinner and then i had the runs all night  my boyfriend ordered the grilled chicken pho and he's the one who ate the summer rolls that i wouldn't touch and he was fine so it couldn't have been the summer rolls so maybe it was the bone marrow or brisket in my pho  i don't know what it was but i will not be going back and will stick with ginger & lemongrass for my bone marrow pho fix  even thinking about giving one less star for the fact that i couldn't communicate at all with any of the workers because they don't speak a word of english 
amazing pho with outstanding service !!! we been looking for pho in flushing area and now there is this great location with tasting pho and refreshing drink menu
quality pho with a good amount of meat  i would definitely recommend their lobster pho  you get a whole lobster with the pho broth infused with the lobster flavor  for the regular beef pho  i prefer phobang more but pho best does an admirable job  will come back again 
i went the pre open and it was not too thrill with pho  one of friends that keep praised this restaurant on his fb  i decided to go there for lunch and give them another shot  we have 1) soft shell crab roll with peanut sauce  2) fishball pho  3) fresh ribeye and beef stew pho  4) spring roll rice vermicelli  5) filet mignon lemongress w rice starts with soft shell summer role  one pair of soft shell was not fresh at all  for $8 95  i gave d for it not advise you waste you hard earn money on it  the next is pho  it is soooo over cooked that disintegrated while in soup  the temp of soup is not even hot  i gave a c  for them  the most worst dishes that we have are the file mignon w lemongress  taste salty and sweet at same time which brings a conflicting orchestra to your pallet  the file mignon is so badly cook which does no appreciation of beef ( regardless they use rib eye instead of real filet mignon ) on top of it  they use green peper as part ingredient that is totally a scam for a vietnamese dish  no  i did not find the lemonsgress in the dish  i end up not completed the dish and just have white rice  regardless the price  this dish earn a big "f" also  please do not expect any high quality service  the wait staff are not going meet your standard will i go back within next 3 months? definite not!!!if you like to throw your money into the toilet  please donate to city harvest instead order the same dishes as as i have  good luck and hopefully this help you to avoid on what not to order at this restaurant 
the pho is bomb here  broth is delicious  bone marrow is a must as a add on for your pho  service is on point 
they have the most unique and delicious appetizers as well as having literally the best pho  they also have great serving portions too  their plates  trays and utensils are very cute clean  and modern  their vietnamese coffee is a must here! they do not use msg and they serve the freshest food possible  all of the workers are very nice and they are very considerate  you will not regret eating at pho best 
amazing place  an aesthetically pleasing place and the food is amazing  the servers are constantly asking about your experience and the overall this place is great  would definitely come again 
the best omakase  the best service  the best conversation we ever had in flushing  queens we had lot of omakase in manhattan  not much in queens  so far  this place is definitely the best of sushi place in queens  the fish  the food are so fresh  very creative dishes  it really worth every penny we spent  we will be back again for seasonal dishes  highly recommend if you love sushi and you love great conversation  most importantly  you love to share the great sushi with your family member including the young kids   this place is kid very friendly! must try!
this place use to be sushi you  they changed the sushi bar to be more traditional but the table arrangement is pretty much the same  we were a party of four  so we called early afternoon to reserve seats for omakase for the same night  we all opted for the $115 set that comes with everything on the $95 set  plus a handroll and the wagyu beef first off  we were served our appetizer  monk fish liver (i'm not a fan of the texture)  something that was like fish brain (it was creamy  stale tasting  really gross)  and oysters (these were good)  then we were served a bowl with a piece of uni  botan ebi and salmon roe  after the appetizers  we waited about 20 mins before we were served our nigiris because it took the chef awhile to prepare every fish  i did not enjoy this part because i felt like we were rushed once the nigiri portion began  we did not have time to take pictures of the pieces and the chef did not seem patient  when one of us was finish with one piece of sushi  he would already serve them the next piece  so he did not wait for the others to finish  i have personally went to omakase that is suppose to be a 30 mins experience  which they sort of rush you a bit because each time slot is timed  which is totally understandable  however  this was suppose to be an 90 mins experience and there was only us at the omakase table and four ladies  who were already having dessert when we got there  the main reason why i am giving two stars is because the sushi rice was so vinegary that all i could taste was rice vinegar  it was absolutely gross and i am a type of person that enjoys freshly grated wasabi  not to place on the sushi  but to taste it a bit between the nigiri pieces  however  they did not provide wasabi on our plates (something i'm not use to)  also  the dessert was so cheap    it was "black sesame panna cotta" (it is black sesame paste with some gelatin   the black sesame was not mixed very well  so the black sesame is all just settled on the bottom)  two small pieces of honeydew and asian pear  we also ordered a bottle of large sake and we all paid $165 person with tip and tax included  we all left unsatisfied another thing  that bothered me was that they did not ask us whether we would like to opt out of certain pieces (i don't like mackerel) and whether we had allergies to anything (2 of us were allergic to honeydew and pears)  i can see potential in this place  but they need to have more outgoing sushi chefs that actually tells their guests what they are serving  after almost each piece  we had to ask the chef what type of fish this is  each time  he would tell us in japanese  but what is it in english? the chef was chinese so he could of told us in chinese as well   i really wanted to like this place  so i would not have to travel to manhattan for omakase 
where do i even begin?     if you've read the other reviews  yes  it's a basement type restaurant but interior looks much better than exterior   the phrase goes  never judge a book by it's cover  there is a long staircase that goes down and when you enter it's like you're somewhere else  japan? lol  we had reservations for 7 30 but they called us and kindly let us know it was booked and if we didn't mind they would love to serve us at 6 so we went in at 6 pm  greeted right away  seated right at the front and brought teas  it was a green matcha tea  my cup of tea was always warm and filled  which i loved  i never had to ask for anything  we went in knowing what we wanted already my husband has the sashimi omakase and i had the sushi sashimi omakase  both were 145$ each  i love a little bit of rice with my sushi so i definitely loved my sushi sashimi omakase  your meal is a little longer if you get sushi sashimi  everything is brought out in orderly fashion  appetizers were delicious! i especially loved the liver that sort of looked like a sweet potato piece  lol  will attach photos  the toro  eel and uni were some of my favorites  everything just melts in your mouth  the steak too! also wanted to mention there is no fish taste at all  the service is also great! everyone is interacting with you  the chef  to waitress to even the gentleman who might be the owner  i'm not sure or the manager  lol  but they all are very kind and talk to you and tell you to ask for anything or if you need explaining  just ask  or like us if you are not sure what to do or where to begin  honestly was a bit intimidated by the sashimi bowl because i didn't know where to begin  lol  it was also amazing to sit front row and watch the chef prepare everything  that was my very first time and it was amazing watching how intricatly the chef makes each nigiri   this will be my favorite high end sushi spot from here on out  also this is my first time ever doing sushi omakase style with my husband  we both loved the experience and had a very pleasant wedding anniversary dinner  definitely worth the price you pay for experience and for what you get 
came here with my friend and we did the omakase  i was bit disappointed in the appetizers    we had monkfish liver  tuna taretare with quail egg  snail  steam egg  i wasn't really feeling the texture and taste of the monkfish liver   i felt the tuna taretare was nothing special   the nigiri pieces were decent  fish was overall fresh   my favorite had to be the wagyu beef and toro   both were really good and would melt in your mouth   price is not too bad  $115 per person  service was good   sushi chef was personable  would i come back ? i don't think so  i had better in the city for about the same price  
this is another hidden gem in flushing for fresh sushi  i would say iki restaurant is number one and this place is number 2 for omakasu  the sashimi is fresh that is a very important aspect  it's worth it getting the omakasu than just ordering different things on the menu  the place is small and intimate    i would not mind coming back here 
located in the basement of an alley that's mostly filled with bars  kakurega stands true to its name  which means hiding place  the interior is quite a contrast to the outside as well  with a comfortable sushi counter that can seat up to around 14 people  (there are also chargers and bag hangers around the counter!) we got the lower tier omakase  priced at 115$  which was enough to fill us up  (i eat a lot too   ) the price is a little more expensive than other sushi places in flushing  but then the quality is also significantly better   from what we heard from the chef  all of the fishes are from japan  they also use top quality rice and other ingredients   the sushi is on par with some of the top omakase places in the city  the appetizers were great as well   i really liked the a5 miyazaki wagyu + the conch shell  (though i think they might've changed the menu  by now ) given that it is a new place  there are still some kinks that they need to work out  but overall it is a great addition to the queens sushi scene 
really disappointed despite all the hype with this place  it's location doesn't really matter to us as long as they serve dishes that were up to par  we went with the $115 omakase menu  however starting with the appetizer itself  i was disappointed  firsly  their kumamoto oysters itself with the sauce were a tad too salty  their 10 pcs sushi were honestly speaking ordinary level  nothing too over the top   service was ok  the place wasn't fully seated all in all  for the price  food was just average  would not come again  there is much better  place around nyc for the price 
i went for my birthday and i enjoyed it  i've had better omakase but this place was good too 
awesome place  very low key but a great ambience  the sushi was very traditional  definitely the best i've ever had 
hi! i'm a 9 year old girl  and i think that kakurega sushi is a wonderful place  it is a restaurant that is located in a basement  the food is really amazing  my dad ordered the a5 miyazaki beef tataki  and it tasted splendid  i tried it also  and wanted to give it 5 stars immediately!dessert is very tasty  i ordered pannacotta  and i thought it's not too sweet and not too boring  after that  the chef gave us 2 types of egg custards   tokyo kind and regular  they both tasted equally yummy  so it didn't really matter 
a sushi gem in flushing  as of now  it is the most authentic sushi spot i have found in flushing   clean and simple decor  friendly service   better than some of the most expansive spots in the city   my dad had the sashimi entree   toro and botan ebi are must orders   they also have hairy crab   but need to call ahead to order because they are flying it in from japan  the restaurant currently does not have a liquor license  but you can byob 
new found hidden gem (after all  its name means "hidden place" in japanese) !! the speakeasy offers premium quality omakase and sake  we made a reservation in advance for seat at the bar (feels privileged to be watching the chefs prepping my food up close)  later on we found out that walk ins are welcome too  we went for the sushi & sashimi omakase  this is not your ordinary japanese take out restaurant   promise it's worth the money  from the first course till the last course  my taste buds were like they went on a roller coaster ride  fish are so fresh i could taste the sea and so fat that they melted in my mouth  makes a huge difference when it's flown from japan on a weekly basis  as for the uni & salmon roe  they are unbelievably mind blowing delicious  personally i love the sensation when the salmon roe sac burst in my mouth  i savored every piece of the roe  as for the sushi  they offered fish that most of us have not heard before  and each fish is as fresh as it gets  and pay attention to the miso soup (yes  because they are not from instant sachet)  they are not to be missed  they taste absolutely amazing and authentic  also impressed by the giant prawn and clams in each bowl of soup  in short  the experience and the variety of food offered at kakurega were unforgettable and worth every penny  would go again to try other food on their omakase menu 
don't really understand the hype about this place  the food is average compare to some of the nice sushi places in queens  would have given 4 stars if the service was good  for a place that charges 4$s you'd expect them to have more knowledge when it comes to serving food and drinks the right way 
i am not the person who likes to write a review  but this restaurant really impress me!! fresh fish  professional presented     i highly recommend the daily special mini bowl from their menu  totally worth it!
very cute restaurant with nice ambiance  a high end ish restaurant for flushing  but if you're looking for something nice  it's worth the price  the food was great  the fish fresh  and the service superb  a must go try 
i'm really satisfied with the fish quality! everything was so fresh  must try the omakase  it was hard to find a good sushi place in flushing  they import their rice from japan! the owner chef is humble and very talented 
if you're looking for a delicate and unique omakase dinner   this is definitely a place for you to spend your night at  the food is so fresh and delicious  it's serve beautifully like an art   the owner said  each month the menu will change so you will not be bored with the same old menu   and this month which is november they have my favourite  abalone   for the chef and the owner is so friendly and funny   we are so lucky to have this omakase restaurant in my area  
for the price the omakaze wasn't worth it   had better omakaze with similar or lower pricing in the city   i only came here cause i heard main chef from the now closed ginpachi was here  my wife and i were happy that he was here but his signature items weren't on the omakaze   i found the experience underwhelming overall 
kakurega sushi  very satisfied  fresh   the best omakase in flushing queens ! my family of four with a family friend spent this great night eating fresh and delicious food   my two daughters were so happy to meet take san again   we were all  so  impressed eating take san's omakase at kakurega sushi !the carefully prepared custom omakase is really great   and we look forward to the next arrangement! such a patient and very hardworking staff! the sushi master  take   san was the master of omakase  from iki  our family was his fan  and his nigiri sushi was really a treat  really happy we found him  and really want to thank my friend on fb who posted a video of his working  where i recognized him at a glance  we immediately went to try this long absence craft ! great to eat  i hope this shop can be maintained  great to try  now they have three options  $ 115 & $ 145 & $ 145  
excellent selection on omakase and the service is very good  $115 value is very good for the quality of nigiri served    the place is new and tables are not filled up at all  the 3 of us had the whole sushi bar by ourself and the restaurant is literally empty    i hope they get more traffic in cos this place is good and recommended 
just came back from kakurega  i need some time to phrase my words  for now let's just say i'm so lucky to find this place! will be back whenever i'm around this area 
this is prob going to be my go to place for great sushi from now on  the chef is very friendly and the waiters are very nice  the food is beyond great and only the best seasonal fish was served on the table and not even one item on the omakase menu  100% recommend  great place 
i had the sushi omakase & my hubby had the sashimi omakase   we both enjoyed our respective choices  excellent quality fish & seafood  from japan ! my hubby had not eaten raw oysters for years (because of an adverse reaction from a reputable manhattan restaurant)  but  he tried them here & loved them ! in my opinion  they were the best oysters i ever had   they were kumamoto oysters  i loved the scallop sushi & ocean water eel sushi (never had ocean water eel before)  go to downtown flushing & try this place   worth the trek from manhattan or any other borough   glad i tried the omakase & plan to return in the future ! the sushi chef paced the omakase perfectly   so  you didn't feel rushed or that service was too slow   make sure you call to make your reservation   foodies know that this place is a good find 
$115 for 19 course omakase！ very worth at this price  wagyu beef is so good very juicy  the most authentic and fresh sushi spot in flushing 
this is probably my favorite sushi bar in flushing  me and my sister had omakase and it was amazing  also  the server was friendly  i would recommend this place 
ok lah is one of the best healthy restaurants in flushing  i have been there many times with my roommate  the portion is huge and flavorful  without a doubt  the owner spent a lot of time to cook and prepare every meal they serve i normally get the 1 2 salad and 1 2 rice  then pick two sides and a protein  the sides and proteins are different everyday so you will never get bored of ok lah  the only one thing i would say is they close at 6 pm  if they stay open late  i will stop by for dinner after work!i highly recommend this place to anyone who lives or visiting flushing  you will definitely fall in love with ok lah 
the one day i decided on a whim to eat healthy  "ok lah" popped up while searching on yelp so i thought why not?remember to check in first! so you can get their free fountain drink  the day i went  they had calamansi and green tea lemonade  the calamansi was a pleasant kind of sweet lemonade for my box  i got brown rice topped with brussel sprouts and brocoli and grilled steak  man i wish i saw the hot sides first! i also accidentally added the soup of the day  thinking for some reason that my box came with three sides when it actually only comes with two  oops i would definitely go to the hot sides section first next time  if i feel like eating healthy while in flushing  i wasn't a fan of the sauce that the vegetables were cooked in  the rice was pretty good  half of my steak was sitting under the lights when i got it and the other half  they retrieved from the kitchen  so the steak was half rubbery  it also had a very strong pepper flavor  the soup was curry chicken soup  it was runnier than i preferred and a bit spicy  i didn't feel it was worth the extra $3 
this is my favorite go to healthy spot in flushing  i was so happy when they opened  don't get me wrong  i love asian food and who doesn't come to flushing to try all the asian food there is?! but sometimes you just need to switch it up and get something healthy and refreshing i normally get the kale salad but you can also mix 1 2 salad & 1 2 rice (which is also really good)  you can choose two sides  which vary daily  and then pick a protein  the chicken and salmon are delicious and i usually alternate between the two  you must also try the tofu! everything is fairly priced at $11  if you add avocado it'll be an extra $1  or any extra side will be $3  i definitely recommend giving this place a try  it's not your typical healthy spot  and their sauces and sides are really flavorful with a kick 
located inside the food court in queens crossing in flushing  ok lah was a great find! for $11  you can choose one protein  two sides and a base of brown rice or salad and with a yelp check in  you get a free fountain drink! sounds pretty good  the food is straight forward  healthy and quite tasty! who says healthy food can't taste good? lol for my first visit  i chose my brown rice for my base  along with two sides of cold macaroni salad and spicy pickles  and for my main protein  i had the chicken  and using my yelp checkin  i had a free fountain drink  which is self serve  you're given two options of calamansi juice or regular lemonade (i highly recommend the calamansi!)  the brown rice has some red quinoa mixed in  which i thought was an interesting combo  definitely added more crunch into each bite  the macaroni salad had some golden raisins in it and the spicy pickle salad was very tasty too! the chicken was delicious! the meat was still juicy and tender and had great flavor! overall  ok lah definitely delivered in both taste and price! for $11  there are few healthy options in the flushing area that can compare  i'll definitely be back to try some other combinations   d
i've heard lots of good things about this place  so finally tried it   it's definitely something new and fresh to the area aside from the usual noodle shops   ok lah sells fresh south east asian fusion in a fast casual concept   you get to choose a base of rice or salad   you get a choice of one main protein as well as two sides (hot or cold)   everything they have that i tried was flavorful  yet light and refreshing   you leave here feeling satisfied  but not weighed down for my protein  i went with the hanger steak   it was cooked perfectly medium rare and was very tender   it was seasoned well and had great flavor   i went with the rice as my base which was a turmeric brown rice   the rice had a really nice bite to it and the turmeric gave it a subtle flavor and a nice yellow color to contrast with the rest of the meal for sides  i went with the soft tofu with salty duck egg   this was something i never knew i'd like  but i enjoyed it immensely   the tofu was so soft and silky  there was a thick soy sauce on top and a topping of crumbled salty duck egg   it was cold and such a refreshing and tasty bite to go with the steak   i also went with the filipino mac  which i was not really a fan of   it tasted of mayo and that was pretty much it   definitely the low point of the meal   i went for a third side because i couldn't resist and got the noodle salad as well  which had some fish sauce in it and gave the meal some acidity finally  i got the calamansi lime drink  which was fantastic   tasted like a more complex version of lemonade   and it was sweetened just right instead of being too sweet for $11 + the cost of a drink  it's definitely one of the pricier options in flushing   but if you want something fresh and tasty  this is it 
my favorite place for healthy eats in flushing! i honestly don't think any other establishment can beat this $11 box of goodness  i love their salmon and prefer it over the other entrees  i'm surprised at how big their portions are (not that i'm complaining)  will be back for more in the future!
i'm not a fan of finding parking in flushing  so when my friends arranged a kamayan in queens crossing mall i was somewhat reluctant  i honestly didn't even know what a kamayan was  after parking near prince at the pay lot we walked over the mall to find a very spacious  clean and modern multi leveled mall  at the food court level we encountered ok lah nyc  a new healthy filipino chinese food style that uses fresh local ingredients  the chefs arranged for us a kamayan   a filipino meal eaten with your hands for the 7 of us to celebrate an engagement  this was truly a food experience  as you can see from the photos  this was an impressive array of broiled salmon  adobo pork belly  grilled steak  lightly seasoned kale  roasted broccoli  fried brussel sprouts and lumpias over a mound of seasoned brown rice  each person had dipping sauces   my favorite was the spicy siracha sauce that went well with just about everything  aside from drinking my lime water meant for hand washing  i would say we nailed it  the salmon was tender  flavorful and covered with a lightly charred skin  highlight  we were fighting over the last piece  what a delight!the adobo pork belly was melt in your mouth   great flavor and texture  so good pork and mushroom lumpias!  great way to start the meal  three dipping sauces   just the right touch of crispiness  savory pork and truffled mushroom  pleasant surprise was the kale salad  the acidity and coldness really cut the other flavors and served as a great palate cleanser  we also brought some of our favorite beers to pair  i highly recommend  i absolutely plan on coming back for their lunchboxes   i woke up this morning craving that salmon!
i love this new addition to flushing  healthy delicious food! yum! this is a long overdue review as i visited when they were still having a soft opening  i'm not sure if they changed their hours (hopefully they did) but during their soft opening  they would close by 6 pm which wasn't convenient as most people work until 5 pm in the city and by the time they get to flushing  this place would be closed  this is literally like an asian filipino version of dig inn!my boyfriend and i got two boxes and we shared the meals so we could both taste everything  box 1   rice  chicken  tofu duck egg salad  filipino mac saladbox 2   rice  steak  sweet potatos  avocadoeverything was super delicious  the chicken was juicy  the steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare  the filipino mac salad was the best side imo  the tofu duck egg salad was unique and super tasty as well! it's kind of pricey for flushing but it is healthy food and it's delicious so the price is pretty fair in terms of that aspect overall  would come back over and over again!
yummy fusion lunch that i would def come back for when i'm out and about in flushing  the portion is huge so you can probably save some for afternoon snack dinner  i tried the steak with half brown rice (probably the most flavorful and yummy brown rice i've tried) and half salad (tasted fresh)  i chose tofu salad (sweet and refreshing  would def get again) and roasted yams (a bit on the dry side as purple yams usually are) as my sides  they were definitely not stingy with their sides! i wasn't able to finish my yams as it got pretty heavy  i wouldn't recommend the yams as a side and would probably try a different side next time  i only wish that they have the option to have more sides even if it means less portion of each side  just because i love trying different items 
rare healthy food spot find located in the heart of flushing  right in the food court of queens crossing! food is made fresh and well seasoned  and sold on a first come  first serve basis  silky egg tofu  i was never really crazy about tofu  but the tofu here had me wanting more  the texture is like that of pudding  and paired well with the sauce  filipino mac n cheese  this tasted dry; not enough cheese    however  it was quite flavorfulhangar steak  yummy  i think it is between medium rare and medium? i was taken aback by how much effort is put into presentation and flavor  the serve sprinkled some seasoning and herb onto it brown rice  grainy and dry  i prefer jasmine rice  calamansi juice  you have to try this! basically it's lemonade limeade  but it's filipino   )fresh and healthy food that doesn't make you feel shitty throughout the day? hells yeah! all in all  can't wait to come back here for lunch with my friend 
pretty decent new opening of a healthy alternative for lunch or even dinner $11 for a base of either salad  brown rice  or a mix of both  your choice of two sides  some being broccoli  filipino mac n cheese  and charred avocado +$1  and a meat option of chicken  steak  or potatoes my favorite was the steak which was neither dry or too chewy  it was the perfect texture and it's doable for something not made on the spot  the chicken meat didn't fall far behind  it was also tender and not dry  the sauce that is slightly spicy also adds a nice finish to the chicken which is cut into two pieces however  things i recommend or suggest would be to avoid the salad and opt for only rice  not sure what greens are included but there was one piece with a really strong bitter taste that threw me off for the sides  i would try the tofu which i haven't yet  and get the broccoli again overall  good quality quick eat in flushing  but healthy food always comes at a bigger cost  i think $11 isn't manageable to eat at everyday  if it was $8 9 i would definitely eat here whenever i'm too lazy to cook clean  light seasoned food 
was not a huge fan of this place    the chicken i got was mediocre  wasn't as tender and moist as i thought it to be and the rice was kind of cold when served  it's definitely one of the more healthier options in flushing for lunch  the silken tofu was good too  the mac and cheese was okay  sadly the yelp check in only gives you their fountain soda  they wouldn't replace it for a water bottle instead 
for something healthy in flushing  this is a great choice it's fast casual pick a base and protein and sides style  with all light and healthy choices  the bases are just salad and brown rice  with hainan chicken  hangar steak and salmon as the main protein options  there are some great unique sides  like a delicious tofu duck egg salad if you want something much lighter and also quick  head to the first floor of the queens crossing mall to try a bowl here 
new healthy fast casual place in flushing! this new vendor  located in queens crossing  focuses on southeast asian food but definitely is more asian fusion to me as they offer a few tasty sides that you wouldn't traditionally find in an asian restaurant to order  you pick a base (brown rice or kale)  a protein (seared steak  hainanese chicken  or tamarind glazed salmon)  and two sides (mac & cheese  sweet potatoes  noodle salad  charred avocado  spicy cucumber salad  duck egg tofu) some comments on the choices i tried    the seared steak was cooked medium rare and seasoned well  i would recommend this   the hainanese chicken was good but i wish it had a little more flavor to it  i almost felt like i was just eating a baked chicken with a chili sauce on top    the duck egg tofu was a super unique dish consisting of tofu with a soy based sauce on top and crumbled with duck eggs  really enjoyed this   i liked the charred avocado and the light coconut milk yogurt which it came with    sweet potatoes could have been cooked a little longer   the brown rice was amazing  so good even just eating it by itself  it's $11 for a bowl which is a bit pricey compared to other stalls in queens crossing  but nobody buys healthy food expecting it to be cheap  i'd definitely frequent this place for lunch if i worked in this area 
maybe not the cheapest food option in flushing area  but overall good healthy option  $11 for a main protein  2 sides  and a base of rice and or salad (at the time there was a promotion for cny so i only paid $10)  only real complaint is that i wish more warm hot options were available for the sides since most are cold options  i heard they rotate what's offered regularly though  give it a try if you're in the area!base  rice + saladi opted for both so i could try the salad and the rice  the rice they offer is a "medium grain brown rice infused with tumeric and red heirloom quinoa " definitely not your traditional white rice if that's what you're looking for  the salad had a nice citrusy dressing that i enjoyed main  roasted chickeni would have gotten the salmon  but i was told that chicken was the only one available when i was ordering (it was a little after 11 am)  luckily  the chicken was not dry at all and was quite tasty  be sure to let your server know not to place the hot chili sauce on top of your chicken though if you don't like a little kick in your food!sides  silken tofu & preserved duck egg saladi've eaten plenty of tofu  but usually not with preserved duck egg  normally not crazy for preserved duck egg since i find the egg white to be too salty (i know it's meant to be salty  but usually too salty for my taste)  this combo works together though! not sure why it's called a salad  but it's basically a block of silken tofu covered with a soy(?) based sauce and then egg yolk crumbled on top  filipino macit was okay  but i probably wouldn't get it again 'cause i'm not the biggest fan of filipino macaroni salad  had pineapple  carrot  celery  and cilantro in it 
4 5 stars the food here is delicious and high quality  i shared the hangar steak with brown rice with charred avocado and filipino macaroni  the macaroni was not over cooked  seasoned well  it's better than your average macaroni with plain mayo  but if you've had filipino mac before than it's nothing new  all the food had a ton of flavor  everyone's taste buds are different but since i usually cook at home but i don't use salt as my only spice  i tend to think all foods outside of my home are overly salty over seasoned  the turmeric brown rice with quinoa was so good  i could eat a bowl of that alone  the avocado was ripe and creamy  so good with the rice together  the steak  cooked medium rare  was still pretty tender  lightly seasoned  which i thought was great since all the sides had so much flavor  $11 not exactly cheap for a food court meal but it's not your average cheap bowl of noodles dumplings is it? l really wanted to get more but we were going to get dinner in a few hours  think we spent $15 ish with drink and tip it's something different in flushing  not having to go all the way to the city and being able to have such a variety of food? i'll definitely come back but i'm actually more interested in the brown rice more so than the proteins available 
a great new addition to flushing! i wanted to try everything on the menu   i decided to go with the roasted chicken over brown rice  roasted avocado  the tofu and kale salad here's my review the turmeric infused brown rice was a nice twist   i don't usually like brown rice but i am a fan  the chicken was moist and had lots of flavor   there were two sauces drizzled on top and that married so well with the chicken and the rice   the tofu was so silky   a must try and who doesn't love avocado?  )i live near flushing so i am so happy that this is so close to home   i will be back to try everything else on the menu!!
i finally ate there yesterday   food was very tasty   i had steak with brown rice    love the brown rice!  it has quinoa   nice match!  great taste and texture  medium rare cook hanger steak with house make hot sauce on top was delightful   great side dishes   they taste so much better than it look though   make sure eat with the calamansi juice 
i was impressed by how fresh and delicious their dishes are  every dish looked so yummy plus super healthy!! u don't find healthy guilty food often  $11 for an entree  two sides and a base of salad or rice  i looooooved the rice cuz it's brown rice mixed with quinoa  and flavorful! protein wise they have steak  salmon  chicken  etc! can't wait to go again and try different dishes next time!
food  4 starsportion  2 starshence the average experience  3 starsi've been enjoying going to ok lah for a while  but today's visit is very disappointing  first of all  i love the concept and their food  however  the portions are getting smaller and smaller each time i heard what my family and friends have to said after i referred them to the business i remembered the first time i got ok lah even with half rice and salad  i was barely able to finish all the food in the container  now   i don't know if the sole reason is depending on the "who "today  i had the girl who is serving me  she gave the tiniest amount as if she counts how many leaves should be given out in a salad base  how many roasted potato should be in the side  i asked why the sides are getting smaller  her reply "cuz it's healthy and balanced meal!" wow excuse me!           balanced meal = small portions!!i guess for a healthy and balanced meal that will cost me $11  i should learn to "appreciated" how thoughtful this girl is  she is "worried" about my health and i should not be eating too much!
i was excited to try out this new spot in flushing because it has such rave reviews  but i was left pretty disappointed  i got the roasted chicken with the broccoli and filipino mac  while some of the broccoli pieces were perfectly charred  other pieces were still pretty raw  the mac was just your average macaroni salad  nothing special  if anything  it needed some flavor (other than mayo) and could be more chewy  the roasted chicken was juicy but needed seasoning as well  it was pretty bland and the skin wasn't crispy either  my husband got it with the sriracha sauce and he said it was good but there wasn't enough of it  they didn't offer the sriracha to me (but i didn't want it anyway) so be sure to ask for it  some parts of the chicken also looked a bit pink so i was afraid to eat all of it  $11 is also a bit pricey for a food court in flushing  i think $8 9 is more reasonable  this place (and its prices) seem like they belong in the city  not flushing  however  the portions are generous and i liked the brown rice  i'm not sure why the cuisine is considered chinese or filipino (other than the lo mien side i saw)  it's more american than anything else  reminds me of lunch spots in the city like dig inn or the little beet where you pick a protein and two sides  the food at those places are better in my opinion  i was expecting more asian seasonings flavors to their dishes but i didn't really notice any  overall  i was not impressed by this place  it's literally just "ok la"

went here for lunch with a friend and was so pleased with this healthy  affordable  delicious  filling meal!!! i rarely eat out  i have never written a yelp review  but this place deserves to be heard because flushing needed a place like this  ) reminded me a lot of dig inn which the employee there told me they were inspired from! however i find dig inn way too salty and their food dries out my mouth but i had no problem with the food here the employee was nice enough to explain each dish and the ingredients   i ended up getting half greens half rice base (greens include kale which explains the bitter taste mentioned below  but i love kale haha)  tofu which u must get because it was bomb af and i don't even like tofu  mac and cheese and chicken adobo  everything was wonderfully seasoned with their own sauces and anyone can easily tell how much thought they have put into these dishes the free filipino lemonade with the yelp check in was also super yummy even though i normally only drink water because it wasn't too sweet which i find most juices to be they also have a loyalty card for a free meal after 10 visits  whenever i get one of these punch cards i usually throw them out but this one i will be keeping because i plan on coming back to try everything else!!!
so glad there is something like this in flushing! this town needed some more healthy options  it's located in a small food court at queens crossing  you basically build your own plate   choose a base  2 sides  and protein  the menu caters to all kinds of people   vegetarians  meat lovers  gym rats  whoever  i got the grilled salmon with 1 2 brown rice  1 2 salad  silken tofu and broccoli  very very filling! so hale  hearty  wholesome  healthy  and tasty!
ok lah  within the heart of flushing there aren't many healthy food options to choose from  look no further  inside queens crossing mall newly opened ok lah offers a variety of healthy wholesome meal  food options changes every day but you can order a satisfying meal for $11  and if you check in on yelp you can get a free calamansi lemonade (filipino lemonade) 8 10extremely satisfied with the customer service supplied by carson  the founder himself 
i check into this place more than 5 times and now it's my favorite lunch spot  i've always wanted a healthy low sodium non greasy meal   and this is just exactly what i want it  
what a pleasant surprise to find such a healthy and good tasting spot for the perfect lunch  have been here twice in a month and will be sure to frequent more often with friends and family  choose your base of salad  rice or a mix of both  choose two sides and a protein  have had their salmon and chicken   both amazing  juicy and flavorful  their hot sauce is so good! great cold drinks as well  can't wait to try another protein next time  wish there were more of you in ny!!!
ok lah is a must try!!! as i work in flushing very often and i am always looking for a healthy  quick  affordable  and most of all a delicious lunch this is my go to place! the staff is super friendly  the food is absolutely fantastic  everything is super healthy  the price point is great  $11 for this food is a steal  please try this place as i ensure you that you won't regret it!!! keep up the amazing work ok lah!
this is my favorite place to eat in flushing! they only serve brown rice and yum  it's full of flavor (sea salt  turmeric  heirloom quinoa  extra virgin olive oil) i don't miss white rice at all and i feel great after  i typically come for lunch  and i get it after my work out at my local gym  it's the perfect combo of healthy grains  vegetables  salads  and lean proteins  i've already lost 8 pounds eating here  that is correlated with going to the gym  they really help me kick start my new year  i would recommend ok lah! to anyone looking to eat clean  they don't use msg  chicken powder  shellfish  nuts  or pork (at the moment)  i'm so glad they're educating people about health  and that healthy food that can be full of flavor  the guys who work there are super friendly and passionate too  major plus  recommended!
ok lah is no doubt one of the tastier healthy options among the food scene in flushing  this place has become one of my favorite lunch spots in the area  for $11  you get a hearty meal that starts off with a choice of either brown rice or salad (both if you go half & half)  that's right  they don't serve white rice in case you're wondering  a bold choice if not for the fact that their brown rice is well cooked and pairs up really well with the rest of the menu  next up  you pick out your two side dishes and your main entrée  the staff are very friendly people so just ask away if you have a question about what to get  my go to side dishes has to be the tofu and the mashed sweet potato  they just remind me of home cooking and i find it especially hard to get sick of em  but every now and then i'll try a new side or the soup of the day  for the entrée  both the chicken and the steak are on point and available every day the place is open for business  the 3rd entrée choice that changes around is usually the one that runs out the quickest so it's first come  first served  last but not least  i'm pretty sure this is one of the few food spots in flushing that offers a loyalty program  so make sure to grab a loyalty card during your first visit (buy 10 bowls & get 1 free) and don't forget to keep getting it stamped! well  ok lah! there goes my yelp review ginity 
ok lah is another option for those who want to eat other foods besides what flushing usually offers  the guys who own this place are so nice  and it's a very clean place  i got the platter of steak  brown rice and vegetables  it's a little more pricey than your typical flushing meal  however it's far healthier  the brown rice was a bit dry but overall  the meal was good  it's located right inside the food court of queens crossing  near paris baguette kung fu tea 
what a breath of fresh air  i've been living in flushing for 2 years now  and people always tell me that flushing's got great food  truth be told  i've exhausted what flushing has to offer and have felt trapped in this cycle of eating the same greasy food  day in and day out this new place is such a god send  it's everything i'd wish for in a meal that i wouldn't mind eating multiple days out of the week  no more greasy dumplings or bbq street meats in which i'm not even sure what i'm putting in my body  for $11 you get a clean  quality and wholesome meal  you really can't get this anywhere else in flushing  my personal favorites the tofu  it's so delicious  it's my must have side along with the avocado  brown rice with the hainanese chicken leg  this is such a generous portion  the hot sauce is legit  getting my meal doused in it next time  i really can't overstate what this place is  i am not exaggerating  give it a shot  it'll change your world!
i been dying to go here because i've been hearing so much rave about this new spot in flushing at queens crossing  queens crossing has a lot of like poke related foods in it  but i've never rly been much of a fan  i tried this place yday because i was passing by and saw the fungbros recording a youtube video for it and they told me to check it out cos it's rly good  so i ordered a plate  you get some rice  salad  and your choice of protein  salmon  hanger steak  or chicken and a bunch of other sides  i ordered the vermicelli rice noodles  salmon toast  and the chicken  my friend ordered the hanger steak and the silk tofu  first off i'm not rly a salad person but their salad was bomb  i think they had mint leaves in there  that rly made the salad more flavorful and brought everything together  the chicken was perfectly cooked  super moist and full of flavor  the steak was also perfectly cooked!! everything was sooo good  and everything was super healthy  this has definitely got to be my new favorite spot in flushing  it's in a little food court but you can see this new spot stole everyone else's customers just cos it's so unique and tasty  come check this place out if you're around in flushing and need a new healthy meal for lunch or something!!
delicious  healthy food although it is a tad expensive  it is good for a light lunch  it is $11 for a meal which consists of a base (brown rice or salad)  two sides  and a choice of protein  i usually don't like brown rice but it was pretty good  for the sides i had the grilled avocado and duck egg tofu  both of which are delicious  the sides are cold except for the sweet potatoes  the salmon was good too but the portion size is a bit small  they also have calamansi juice  which is filipino lemonade  for $2 and comes with free refills  there are plenty of seats nearby in the common food court area if you want to sit and eat 
finally a healthy spot in flushing and i'm talking about kale  beef  sweet potatoes  salmon avocado and more! sounds like it wouldn't exist in flushing  but with the town's growing demographic i think this is very appropriate! bowl costs around $11 and you can choose a base  a main and 2 sides i got the kale salad with hangar steak with avocado and mac n cheese with yam and sweet potato  everything was tasty and comparable to what i'd taste in fairways or whole foods  not the cheapest item you'd find in flushing but no where is healthy made food is cheap haha  i'll come try the salmon next time!
unfortunately  i went here when they were all out of the bliss potatoes but  today they had roast pork so i wasn't too bummed out  i had half salad and half rice  the rice was well cooked and the salad was delicious as usual  i like how they add mint to the mix  at first it was surprising but with the dressing  it brings a nice spring like flavor  today's option also included spring radishes  i was surprised that they didn't have that spicy taste like the red ones but they taste super good!! it wasnt too sweet and it went well with the roast pork and everything else i had  the seasonal mac was great too! i liked how it tasted sweet but not too sweet  the green peppers and the celery brought a nice crunch to it too now  lemme tell you about the best part of the meal!!!! roast  pork  one of the best kind of pork i've ever eaten! one can easily cut into it and it was so well seasoned and wasn't too chewy nor was it too tough  get it with the spicy sauce and it's spicy heaven!to top it all off  the calamansi juice made everything better  i love how sweet it is and i love how soft the flavor is compared to the lemonade i'm so used to  the people there are so nice and always have a smile on their face  i love how warm and inviting it is every time i go there if you're not into pork  i highly suggest the salmon  the skin has an extremely nice crunch and the fish itself is full of flavor  so  in other words  this is such a great place compared to the other options flushing has to offer  although i love my pork fried dumplings and ma la tang  this place always leaves my tummy happy and full  ^ ^
i love the food  it tastes so good and its health i love it where it came to flushing because idon't need to lots of places  the best place i saw 
ok lah is ok (lah!)  i think of ok lah as a better and lighter dig inn   the concept is essentially the same in that you go down the line picking your base  sides  and protein main  but dig inn typically leaves me only able to finish 50% of my box and feeling like i just ate something extremely dense  not so at ok lah! the sides seem to rotate so each time i've gone there has been at least 2 things different since the last time  but it's always tasty and interesting and adequately both light and filling at the end  my advice would be to go with the salad base though   i found the half and half to be too much with all the rest of the food the main issue with ok lah is that everything seems pretty hit or miss  sometimes the food is really good  and sometimes it's over  or under done  portions are also an issue and it seems like you get portioned based on your frame   i often go with my office and my petite supervisor will get a smaller piece than my larger coworker (which i think kind of makes sense but supervisor did not appreciate it)  steak is also hit or miss with some pieces being well done and some being medium (i never get the steak but my officemates often do and compare cuts)  overall i enjoy ok lah and for $11 i feel it's a good deal  but it's definitely more of a lunch break spot that a place you take a visiting friend 
if you want to eat healthy fulfilling food that doesn't have much grease and oil this is the place to go  it's like the asian digg inn version  food there is really great especially the tofu 
clean and healthy food and very chick presentation  i almost eat this everyday during the week  less oil  less sodium  more vegetable and more nutrition 
i've been wanting to try ok lah since my best friend told me about her heavenly mouth watering experience  was sad the one time i tried to go i was too late because they close pretty early  nevertheless  today i ventured off to the horrendous saturday flushing mob to get myself some ok lah  unfortunately enough there weren't many seats to stay and enjoy my meal so i took it to go and saved it for dinner ordered the steak with rice  kale salad  filipino mac  and broccoli  you know food is good if you can heat it up later and still enjoy it as if it was just freshly prepared i'm pretty picky about my macaroni salad because it's not my favorite side dish in the world but ok lah's filipino mac is the bomb! better than any version my mom has ever made so that's saying a lot  definitely want to go back and try the salmon next time 
healthy meets flushing! this is a breath of fresh air among the greasier nearby chinese options  the owner  carson  is really friendly and more than happy to guide you through what you can order  kiiiiinda pricey but you'll leave happy and full but not bloated 
ok lah manages to make healthy food taste down right amazing  my favorite is the steak  tofu and salted egg yolk croutons  the flavors are mediterranean inspired and you can taste the quality  to open a restaurant not serving chinese   asian food in flushing was a big statement  definitely get the tofu 
11 bucks for pretty decent food if your looking for something filling but light  the chicken is really good  the beef looked a little bit dry  i would come here again
came here looking for healthy food  for $11 it's not affordable for lunch but if you're in the area  it's cool  i ordered the salmon  half rice half salad  broccoli side and sweet potato side  everything tasted good but the rice is undercooked  when cooking quinoa they are supposed to bud and these are still whole  the rice was rough as well  if the rice quinoa is steamed longer i would give this place 4 stars  if there was an option for 1 main and 1 side for $5  i would give this place 5 stars  i hope that my review is taken into consideration 
if i lived in flushing (or if they were open later) i'd be here all the time  randang meatballs  charred avocado  sweet potatoes  and 1 2 salad and 1 2 rice  healthy  light  excellent salad dressing  looking forward to returning 
great food! comfort meets healthy eating ok lah is leading the way in the new trends and changing of the culture in the area  very delicious highly recommend the chicken and the tofu side is amazing as well 
this is a hidden gem  came across ok lah when looking for healthy food options in flushing and i was in for a treat my order consisted of the 1 2 and 1 2 base  silky tofu cherry tofu sides and the roasted chicken main    base review  salad with the dressing was very refreshing and the brown rice with quinoa has a slight nutty bite with a nice simple crunch  if you're not starving for carbs would recommend 1 2 and 1 2 option   sides review  not sure what sorcery was used but the silky tofu was very creamy and kept me wanting more  the cherry tofu was not pale in comparison at all  it was surprisingly springily with a burst of flavor in each bite   main  the chicken was very clean cut and pleasantly tender  will definitely order this again overall you can see how much preparation  care and effort was put into each one of these dishes  the eye capturing presentation really opens up your appetite  the staff are very friendly and eager cater to customers  the wholesome mix of ingredients will keep me coming back 
finally a healthy option in flushing! you can make your own bowls for $11  a steal for what you get  you get a choice of salad or brown rice (their rice has quinoa and turmeric  super delicious)  2 hot or cold sides  and 1 lean protein  the chicken is sooo juicy and perfectly cooked  actually everything was thoughtful done  the guys who work there are super nice  they told me that they wanted to help the community and change the way they think about food  i could really eat this food everyday without feeling guilty  go support them!
great healthy alternative located in queens crossing food court in flushing  the meal includes a fresh salad with brown rice  selection of different sides and a protein  i really liked the meatballs and salmon  delicious balanced meal with a lot of flavor  will definitely be back
very healthy and fast! the diet is very balanced with veggie  protein and carbs  lovely place to have your work lunch! ordered the grilled salmon  which was very juicy! yummy!
i really like the healthy food here! fast serving and very delicious! i ordered half half (salad brown rice)  silken tofu  roasted broccoli   grilled salmon last time and i think i probably will get the same plate today! btw  the plate is $11 (tax incl ) and they accept credit cards!
i'm very excited to try this new place not only because i'm a filipino and they offer some filipino dishes  but because they are offering very healthy food! for the base you can choose between brown rice with quinoa or the salad or half and half  the sides are so good  you would wanna try everything! for the main  we ordered the roast chicken and it is very good too! they have salmon and steak as well! they have calamansi juice too! will definitely come back!
not "ok lah " the food was mediocre at best  very salty potatoes and brussels sprouts  over rated yelp reviews 
the food has so much flavor  nothing is bland  so filling without feeling guilty  the avocado is amazing  even if it's a dollar more  i suggest mixing the cream that comes in the avocado to make it more creamier  although the salmon is a smaller piece than the others  i do suggest the chicken  $11 is a steep price compared to other foods in flushing  but it's delicious 
healthy food is a rare sight in flushing so if you're looking for a healthy option this is the place to go  for $15 i got rice and quinoa  salad  filipino mac n cheese  rice noodles  beef stew  salmon miso soup  and a bottle of water  food and service were great  it's quite refreshing to see a spot like ok lah in our area so i will definitely go back 
very refreshing to find this type of food downtown flushing   good potion size for those who are health conscious 
carson provided great service and an insightful introduction to ok lah  the food is healthy  delicious  the sauces taste great  and the food display area was very presentably clean  it's a spot definitely worth stopping by more than once  the price for the food is great and i am happily satisfied with my first experience here 
this place is bomb  the chicken is perfect  if ur looking to eat clean but still want ur meat come here  great service and better food with lots of sides  this place is bomb  the chicken is perfect  if ur looking to eat clean but still want ur meat come here  great service and better food with lots of sides  this place is bomb  the chicken is perfect  if ur looking to eat clean but still want ur meat come here  great service and better food with lots of sides  this place is bomb  the chicken is perfect  if ur looking to eat clean but still want ur meat come here  great service and better food with lots of sides 
at last  there's a healthy alternative to literally everything else that makes up flushing  this place on the come up offers food that looks straight out of new york city  and now it's here in queens crossing  a complete contrast to the surrounding area  which includes greasy and unhealthy chinese food that's permeated flushing since it came to be  the refreshing setup includes a neon sign saying "ok lah!" in cursive  letting customers get a feel of their vibe  and bright lights illuminating the whole area  a long piece of glass separates the food from customers  where they can see everything ok lah has to offer for the day  similar to how you would order something at chipotle  you pick a base first (salad  rice  both  etc  )  and then two sides (spicy cucumber  tofu  charred avocado  broccoli  etc ) and then a main to top it off (grilled steak  roasted chicken  vegetarian  etc ) you can always expect top notch service from the two guys running the whole show  honestly  $11 is around the same price as any other place would charge their items  these guys give generous portions and then some  so if you want to try an awesome spot  be sure to give this place a shot  they don't disappoint 
first time here and i already love the food! the guy was really friendly  nice  patient and suggestive to people who are new there  love the smell of all the fresh food  really hygienic and love how there are many options to choose from but sad that i came at the time they were about to close if not i would've tried their salmon  ( will definitely be back to try all their other food selections 
healthy and tasty! so glad a spot like this finally opened in flushing 
the staff who work here are very friendly and happy to help  the food was quite tasty along with their accompanying spicy sauces  we had the salmon and chicken main dishes and my kids devoured it  the filipino fountain drink is a little weird in the beginning but it grows on you  if we lived close by would come visit more often 
i was looking forward to healthier options in flushing but this spot disappointed me  too much rice  small protein portions  and uninspiring sides 
good food  rare healthy food option in flushing   it's a chipotle style type restaurant with a southeast asian theme  their calamansi juice (filipino lemonade) is pretty good and you can have free refills  tastes more or less like regular lemonade  but a little bit better i guess   and the hot and sour salmon soup is pretty good  i was expecting something like chinese hot and sour soup with salmon meat in it  but i was pleasantly surprised to find a clear broth hot and sour salmon soup  refreshing and fresh  the salmon actually tastes fresh which is hard to come by in flushing  the salmon fried rice was pretty good too  and did you know?  you can get anything as a side instead of buying the whole set    the downside is i'm not a fan of kale or macaroni  but other than that  pretty good  duck egg tofu  sounds weird  never tried it   so i can't really tell what it tastes like praise the lord jesus christ for his grace is good  literally  the lord knows what we have need of even before we pray 
fantastic place  always wanted a "dig in" like healthy meal option  it also has a chinese and filipino style and flavoring to it! foods great and the owner is very friendly  imo the food is given at a great price and doesn't break the bank  it's more expensive than your typical five dollar flushing lunch but that is the price of quality
great place  health and yummy  just a few advice if you want to order there   skip the noodle salad because it is very flat  no taste at all  and also skip the philippino mac  it smells really really weird  i think they added vinegar and mayonnaise in there  wish they can reconsider something else to replace those two sides  other than that their foods are great  i will go there again 
high ceilings  industrial design  and a great place to enjoy chicken wings with a pitcher of beer! we thoroughly enjoyed our $30 set on a sunday evening  the original soy garlic wings taste much better than the spicy ones  look forward to try the rest of the menu!
pleasant surprise of a chill korean chicken serving bar in flushing amongst all the chaos and traffic in flushing  tucked away on prince street  is the coop  no  they don't serve dim sum  korean bbq or soup dumplings  like what feels like every establishment in flushing  but instead they give you a hip  city like hangout that is pretty hard to find in this area we dropped in on a friday evening at around 8 30pm for 14 people  which we had to make a reservation for  in fact  not only did we have to make a reservation  but we had to guarantee a tab of at least $30 per person  honestly  it wasn't an issue that we would probably spend that much per person  but the fact it's a restaurant requirement kind of irked me a bit  anyhow  it didn't ruin our experience though our group gradually came in  but i was told that we were allowed to sit immediately despite the entire party not being there all together  throughout the evening  i would have to say the service from our waitress was very good  she was attentive  quick with the service and friendly  we ordered     ordered     and ordered some more and let's just say we easily breezed by the $30 per person requirement i won't comment on every single item  but here's a list of some of what we ordered lychee sojularge order of half & half coop wingsbulgogiseafood jeon   seafood pan cake with mussels  prawns  squid and spring onionjogae tang   clear clam soup with onions and pepperskimchi fried rice   stir fried kimchi and ham  rice topped with a fried eggla galbi la   barbequed beef short ribs with grilled vegetable and saladpulled porkas for what really stood out  first  if you're going to order the wings  beware that if you order any hot wings  they are not playing around  everyone on our side of the table definitely felt the heat from them  so if you're not a heat seeker  go with the soy garlic only  the jogae tang  the clear clam soup  was another item that made its mark  however  it wasn't a highlight  even though the clams were huge and plentiful  the soup was very bland and watery  the last item that etched a mark in my memory was the pulled pork  it was very flavorful  tender and very easy to eat  it was some of the better pulled pork i'd actually had in while  if you're curious about the other items on our list  they were all on point and worthy of ordering  but don't expect to be really impressed  they were solid and tasty overall  the atmosphere was perfect  for a sports bar environment  it wasn't very loud  ok  so we couldn't hear what the other side of our large table was conversating about  so we had to have isolated conversations with our side  but i expected the place to actually be louder  there were 2 tvs that i noticed inside  one massive one on the wall  and another smaller one above the bar  most of the seating inside is bench seating  so if your back can't handle it  maybe this isn't your spot  as a group  it seemed everyone enjoyed themself  and by that  i mean the food was really good and the place was chill  it didn't hurt that the service was on the mark too 
the wing is just deadly delicious  crispy rich flavors juicy you name it  the best part with this restaurant is you can customize the half&half  so i asked for just 4 spicy wings and the rest soy garlic  the spicy wing is perfect  perfect amount of spiciness the kimchi fry rice  very dry for my taste  kimchi fry rice but i seee no kimchi  just stay with wings here  don't do no rice when it comes to the drinks  im so disappointed  how can the food be so good and the drinks taste like shit  its overly sweet like im drinking straight sugar water with strawberry flavor for 25 buck  no comment  end up just getting a pitcher of beer  i guess ill stick will beer when i come back here next time  overall very good service  wings is a must try thing 
traveled all the way to flushing for the fried chicken here! they had many options for chicken  we went with the large order of wings with a mix of soy garlic and spicy  they were nice and allowed us to choose how many of each type of wings we wanted  since i only wanted a taste of the spicy  also got an order of the spicy rice cakes  the service was fine and the food served decently quickly  the wings were good but not the best i've had  we were warned about how spicy the spicy wings were and they were right  but it was definitely tasty and not unbearable  the soy garlic was also good  i was a bit disappointed that they did not have drumsticks but the wings were nice and crispy  the spicy rice cakes were good  pretty standard  though for $15 felt to be a bit pricy  overall not bad and not a bad choice if i lived closer  not worth the travel in my opinion though
thoroughly enjoyed my visit here when i came for dinner with friends i ordered some seasoned fried chicken in dakgangjung flavor  and it was a bit more    soy sauce y and spicier than i had expected  but not too bad! it was fried well and juicy inside  however  the size of the pieces were slightly on the smaller side i loved the pumpkin cheese dish they had  best to eat when fresh and hot! so much cheesy goodness  it gets a little hard and less gooey when it cools down so it doesn't taste as good later  the seafood pancake was super crispy and a little bit more on the thick side  very filling and delicious!i got the blueberry cocktail and it was delicious  it came with fresh berries! super sweet  personally liked it more than the peach soju cocktail that we also ordered  speaking of the peach soju cocktail  it was very sweet and also came in a pretty big pitcher  not sure how strong it is  but definitely gets the job done to get you lit!the french fries also were a good portion size and were also the same kind of crispy as the seafood pancake!the only reason i give this place 4 stars is that we had to flag down our server every single time we wanted something  and she disappeared once for at least 15 minutes when we wanted the check  atmosphere is simply lit and a little cramped  noise level is high because of the people and the korean music they play  also have multiple tvs with sports playing 
for sure this is one of my favorite fried chicken restaurants in competition with mad for chicken  it's located in flushing so it was pretty convenient to get to  they usually decorate the restaurant for special times of the month like halloween  whenever i come here i always go for there soy garlic chicken  no doubt will you be upset from it  during happy hours i always get oysters for a dollar each which is always fresh and tasty  this is a place that is always serious about good quality and food service 
i'm a fan! came here with three people on a saturday around 7pm and got seated immediately  the chicken was delicious and cooked perfectly  crispy and spicy! mushroom stew was actually quite tasty too  along with the egg omelet thing  quick service; nice waitress got us free shots and took them with us  would come again for drinks and dinner    or when i'm craving solid korean fried chicken again  happy hour menu has good choices too 
i've been wanting to come here for a while and finally did for a friend's birthday dinner a few months ago  it was pretty dim and dark inside like most gastropubs i've been to  the restaurant is pretty long and has a lot of seating  we came on a friday night and boy was it crowded  busy and loud as well  the menu seemed very limited  but we did make an effort to try different menu items  we ordered the coop wings  soy sauce and spicy  i typically don't eat chicken wings (for personal reasons)  but the soy sauce chicken wings was pretty good  the japchae was cooked right  but tasted mediocre  i've definitely had better  the bulgogi quesadilla was okay  not something i would typically like to order or have  the seafood jeon was cooked perfectly and had good flavor! we also ordered the pane seafood cream udon which i actually liked because it was something different that i typically don't see at korean restaurants  it was creamy  cheesy and delicious  the last menu item we tried was their spam fries which i thought was quite interesting  mostly filipino restaurants serve spam fries  the spam fries were crisp and delicious  but i would have preferred having the banana ketchup to dip with overall  i thought the food was just okay  it does have a korean and asian twist to some of the typical food you would find at a gastropub  service was okay  the chances of returning would be 50 50 because i typically don't like going to super loud  'i can't hear what my friends are saying' type of places  food didn't really wow me and it was also a little pricey for the portion size of the food 
i love chicken wings  korean chicken wings food is always 5 5 here  it's located in one fulton square in flushing  ny  really convenient to get to for a lot of people who live in queens  the service is great here even when it is 2am in the morning  the wings here are crispy on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside  they are rich with flavor  whether it is soy garlic or hot  the hot tends to be on the spicier side so be careful if you can't eat spicy! other than the wings  i usually get the bulgogi quesadilla and the sweet potato fries as well  the bulgogi quesadilla is one of my favorite dishes out of the whole menu  it is a nice korean twist on a mexican dish and it comes with a salad and sour cream to dip on the side  i ordered the budaejigae a couple times as well  portion of it is huge! you can definitely share it among 3 people at least  i want to try stopping by for happy hour here one day to try their oysters cause i heard a lot of good things about them too!
so my two friends and i sometimes go to the coop  but today was the first time the waitress actually called us out on not tipping enough  i thought we tip on how good the service was  the food was alright  we had to wait a long time to put in our orders and waited a while to get our food and drinks( no bartender)  because of us waiting for so long we didn't tip the 'required' amount  there was only two people working the floor  i was surprised that they actually stopped us from walking out just so they get their tip  other then this my experience here was great 
located in a little nook in flushing but here's nothing little about the wings or ambience of this place  let's start with the food  ahhhhhmazing  tried two kinds of wings and they both hit the spot and were right on with flavor  they have a wide variety of options on their menu too! i can't wait to try more  ambience  sort of a rustic dining experience  on this occasion they decorated for halloween which was also really cool to look at  everything really clean  bathrooms included! the music was also okay! not sure if i would recommend the drinks  i had my usual  coronas  however my friend had a drink (i forget the name  sorry guys) that was visually appealing but he said it had a dry sort of taste  personally  i didn't have it but i thought it thought be said all in all  def make your way here for great wings!
everyone knows the best fried chicken is korean fried chicken! im something of an expert at fried chicken  when ever im around chicken's they tremble in fear as they can smell their fallen brethren on me  i eat way to much fried chicken to be honest  but hey if i die from fried chicken  it would have been a journey worth the travel  the coop has got its finger on the pulse of korean fried chicken! with a couple of tasty sauces  and that extra crispy bite that makes you want to just keep going back in for more  the "spicy" version is only spicy if you're not used to some heat  for me it barely registered =d as for the sweet  its like having chicken and waffles with out the waffles!love chicken and waffles? grab the sweet wings! a bit sweet for my tastes but it was still really good! i will stop by again when i have the time  worth the trip out here if you have the time  make sure to get the sweet potato fries! i like to mix gochujang and a little bit of sesame seed oil together and dip the fries into 
let me preface this review by stating that i think this spot is a 4 4 5 star for large groups that seeks a comfortable place to drink  eat fried chicken  and loiter  the service was very friendly and attentive  the space is large and attractive  they have an impressive drink menu  and the food options are like glorified hors d'oeuvres   we ordered the half and half fried chicken platter (we chose traditional and "korean marinated") budae jigae  and gratin  the chicken was ok  crispy on the outside  but otherwise not memorable  the "korean marinated" version was interesting  quite spicy  but not in a hot way  which is what we wanted  but i guess that's on me for not ordering the hot version  which i didn't realize was a different thing  the budae jigae was pretty sad  frankly  kind of your basic korean stew  but chock full of spam  hot dog links  and pepperoni  it sort of tasted like they had prepared the soup base in advance and tossed all the meats in last minute  far from being worth the $29 price tag  the gratin was really tasty  but it's pretty much impossible to mess up fried rice with melted cheese on top  another weird detail  they didn't have real soup bowls for the stew  all they had were these really shallow bowls that made it difficult to eat the budae jigae without spilling all over the table  our waitress apologized profusely  so clearly they understand that it's an issue  which makes it all the more baffling  i don't think i'll be returning unless i happen to have a large  hungry  rowdy group of folks with me in the area 
crispy  crunchy  flavorful wings!! atmosphere in this place is great  you feel good vibes the moment your seated we started out with the bulgolgi bambimap or however yah all that! super flavorful! plus i desperately needed some green veggies and this dish got that in for me  the white kimchi on the side was an interesting addition to this dish next we had the small order of wings which was 12  we went with the half and half which comes with six of the garlic soy flavor and 6 spicy  these wings was in my top 5 all time wings ever tasted  cooked to perfection and perfect amount of juicyness  if your in flushing  get these wings!
well place is great for a date of just chill out   really comfy sitting at the bar or the sides with soft chairs   it's spacey so even when busy it doesn't get loud and you can still hear each other  there are many screens to watch sports too  the negative was the price which is high for all the apps even the spam fries   the cocktails are expensive and small though pretty uniques   the beer glasses are tiny so better of getting pitcher  also our bartender was really careless and looked like he was annoyed serving us   though the other waiters were so nice  so this kinda made experience worse
have to give it three stars because of the service  i ordered the half fried chicken and i liked it but i didn't realize it was tenders and i like it on the bone  there were a few on the bone and some weren't on the bone  the waitress brought my friends food first  maybe ten minutes before mine  and that's a big no no  food is supposed to come at the same time  she promised us white rice with it and of course with mine i had to ask for it with another waiter  i also had to ask for dipping sauce from another waiter  my waitress never came to check to see if we needed anything  i get it was busy but come on  but the place is pretty and they have some cool things on the menu  my friend had the pork belly and she said it was very spicy  oh and they had a really good mojito!
what a great restaurant especially for you're a late night eater  walked in and was seated immediately as well as our orders  upon waiting for our food i realized the entire restaurant with about 25 guests at the moment we're completely being taken care of by just one waiter and a bartender  they kept up the service  food came super quick and the kept checking every table constantly  i was amazed at such proper service especially late night! had the pork fondue which was amazing  highly recommend this place food and service is amazing 
came in at 12 45 and was greeted by who i assume to be the manager to serve us   he sat us at the bar  to which one of us immediately went to the bathroom after threehours on the road  where the barman asked how many we were   i said three and he gave us two menus he came back a minute later and told us "last call "  i told him my friend was in the bathroom and asked if he could wait for him  to which he said no   my other friend said the time on the door read 2  and asked if they were open until 2  to which he said they were open to 2  but again stated final call was before 1  as the kitchen was closing   despite being open until 2 refusing to wait for our other friend  we ended up individually using the bathroom and leaving pro tip  you can have as good customer service as possible  if your hours say open until 2  stay open until 2 we went across the street to 39 kings cafe and don't regret it at all   one star for making us go there 
parmesan  truffle  fries the coop  aptly named  is a pricey place  for good reason  their dishes are wonderfully made  beautifully presented and scrumptious the atmosphere and decor is lively too while allowing you to be able to talk your friends without shouting the korean fried chicken is so crispy and well seasoned  it's very hard to describe  you should definitely give their chicken a try if you can!
apparently posting business operation times means nothing  fuck this place  unwelcoming and unprofessional 
a group of us came here randomly after a night of childish fun with some friends  we found ourselves in queens and rolled up to the coop  we walked in and were seated immediately  there were five of us and despite it being after 1am they were pretty packed  the vibe is very energetic and the restaurant feels likes it's more of a bar or lounge  even the staff is very nice and they have decent prices and interesting drinks  we had our fill of kimchi rice  mixed spicy wangs  bulgogi and brew  the food is excellent  drinks are strong and service on point  i'm happy we accidentally found this place  definitely worth a return visit and they're less than a 30 minute drive from my house! thry also have happy hour m f if 3p 6p  woot!next visit i'm getting the creamy seafood udon and that bulgogi quesadilla   
came here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday  made reservations online on their website and when we got to the restaurant there was a table ready for us and all set up  the food was really good but the portions was very little  i felt like the price range was way too expensive for the portion size  they are popular for korean fried chicken but the portion was way too small  there are other kfc chicken stores on northern blvd that give you huge portions for the same price as here   we ordered a variety of food on the menu and many popular dishes that had high ratings on yelp  the atmosphere and setting of the restaurant was really nice but not sure if i will be returning  the location of the restaurant was so inconvenient being in the heart of flushing and parking is a pain  i highly recommend for people to come check this place out at least  once 
wings are always good  great place for drinks and to watch the games now that summer is around the corner  for bring groups that have picnic style benches if needed  they are close to some good desert places if you don't want to stay there for dessert  but they have some great dessert for sure  if you are in the flushing area stop in have some wings and a soju bomb
great soy garlic chicken wings  good kimchi fried rice! they serve raw oysters too; sometimes it's really fresh and sometimes not so much  service is meh 
food  5 5  might be the best wings i had for a while  service  5 5  despite having only one waitress and one bartender during the happy hour  they are incredibly prompt and attentive came here on a weekday to try out their happy hour menu  when i walked into the restaurant  i was surprised it was half full already at 4pm ish  even the bar area was filled with a few customers  i ordered a dozen oysters  half a dozen wings  and a drink  overall the food was good  especially the wings  it was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside  there was two kind of sauces you can pick  i chose 4 hot wings and 2 soy wings  ended up liking the hot wings better  the soy wings were a tad too salty in my opinion  anyway  the oysters were decent  but not much i can complain with its $1 oyster price tag  the drink i felt was slightly weak on the alcohol  but it was made up by the richness of fruity flavor  all in all  i enjoyed the happy hour meal and will definitely visit again if i am in the neighborhood and craving for some wings and oysters 
great vibe with young people hanging out during the weekends  the servers are very nice and professional 
if you love korean food you will love this place  i come here pretty often  great ambiance and friendly servers  this place has so many varieties of korean food from korean fried chicken to dukboki to hotpot  they also have flavored soju! the flavors of the foods are honestly so unbeatable  perfect place to sit down and catch up with friends with some soju and food  great for snacking late night as well  and right downstairs after you eat  is a dessert bar  very convenient to get to as well  highly recommend!
i can't even tell you how much i love this place  it's become my regular spot with my friend after work  i've been here so many times that i lost track  whether i'm happy or down  this is the place i go to  their wings are some of the best in flushing and they make my drinks just the way i like it  they also offer fusion dishes like bulgogi quesadilla  which is what i always order alongside my wings and fries  the staff are all friendly and young and love to chat with me and my friends  this is such a nice and casual hangout spot that i definitely recommend for everyone 
the coop had me at 'spam fries ' spam conjured so many childhood memories   spam fried rice  spam with fries eggs sandwich  spam and eggs over rice  spam with ramen   i haven't had spam in over half a decade  i heard spam is unhealthy for me  suddenly when a friend invited us to dinner at the coop  i thought let's be adventurous and try the infamous spam fries  which my fellow yelpers raved about  these fries didn't disappoint  we also ate the korean fried chicken  parmesan  fries  creamy seafood pasta and korean pancake  fried chicken had the perfect blend of crispy skin and juicy meat; i also like the hint of sweetness and garlic flavors  live with no regrets  eat a spam fry or two  it's low sodium  i will definitely be back soon for round 2!
mmmmmm  where should i start? their food is amazing  filling  reasonably priced and the service is excellent  i came here on sunday night around 9pm with my boyfriend and his friend  my bf loves boka in the city  and surprisingly he enjoys the coop's fried chicken better than boka! (don't get me wrong  i love boke and coop's chicken equally) we ordered the budae jjigae  12 pieces of mixed wings and legs with half spicy and half regular  kimchi fried rice  and ribs fondu  we actually over ordered so i took 3 pieces of chicken and kimchi fried rice to go  budae jjigae  so good  so so good! mixture of hotdog  spam  ramen  kimchi and other veggies  the only down side is that they gave 2 tiny pieces of enoki mushroom and a tiny bit of ramen  i ended up eating only one string of ramen because my bf's friend took almost all of the ramen  to make up my ramen loss  i ate the only 2 pieces of enoki mushroom  so in the future  i'll just ask them to double the ramen and enoki mushroom  kimchi fried rice  not the best  i've had better  my bf didn't enjoy much of it because it was kind of dry  he said he likes boka's kimchi fried rice better  rib fondu  pretty good  the meats are very tender  it slides right off the bone  the flavor is okay  nothing too special  but the ribs wrapped cheese and corn is super fun to eat  chicken  yup  the show stopper  extremely spicy (for me) but super yummy! the regular soy sauces one is a better fit for me  i'm good with chinese spicy  not korean spicy  their spicy is on another level  overall  we will definitely be back!
a convenient place to get your korean fried chicken fix since it's in the heart of flushing  overall  an average place to me and here's why place   i've been here multiple times but i never feel comfortable dining in there  packed or not  probably the seating and the placement of tables on top of each other  service   spotty  sometimes they are their to help other times they are ghosts  food   wings are great! as for the other stuff it's alright  there was nothing else on the menu that stood out  did i miss anything? overall  average!
the place looks cool and a lot of korean people seem to me to be in line with the original taste in korea  the service was excellent and very pleasant  i took their special coop wings with soy  was reasonable and not more  guess it's a lot of a matter of taste  they were cook well but the soy and the other sauce wasn't my thing  i would certainly consider coming there to taste other dish from the manu 
young eun provided excellent service! he was extremely nice and friendly! the food was awesome and tasty  the food was a reasonable price  we loved the cheese fondue  overall satisfied!
the chicken wings are very spicy so i endured half of one   it's ok  if you can get passed the stinging burning sensation and swollen lips  i normally like spicy cuisines but i have never been a fan of these korean hot wings  their bulgogi is great  the quesadillas are good too  the truffle parmesan fries   yum but i'd skip the parmesan because they literally doused our fries and it was covered in the cheese  i liked the pancakes too   it was warm chewy and had just the perfect amount of seafood mixed in the layers  it's loud here   and not very crowded  if the music wasn't so loud  it would make for a great place for a date night 
after my 1st experience at the coop  i thought it was alright  nothing special  i like the atmosphere inside  it's nice and airy  has a modern feel to it  as some other reviewers have mentioned  i don't like the bench seats; as it has no back support  (us old folks  can't handle it  lol) the bar has a nice setup and downstairs by the entrance  there's another locked cabinet full of the high end liquor! i came with a group of 5 and we ordered truffle parmesan fries  the kimchi cheese okonomiyaki pancake  and we had a large order (20 pieces) of half & half wings (soy garlic & spicy)  food came out fairly quickly  i didn't care for the truffle fries because of the artificial truffle oil that they used  the kimchi cheese pancake was interesting  very gooey  and actually tasted good  i would order that again  the wings though  were alright  very similar to mad for chicken  if i was craving chicken  i probably wouldn't travel all the way to flushing  when there's so many other better options along northern blvd 
this is the place to go on your cheat days and late night cravings  this place does not disappoint  friendly staff and there is always something for everyone of the menu  i dont know how many times ive been here but at one time i was coming here once a week  ive probably tried everything on the menu  except for the spicy entrees  i cant really eat spicy  the best combo is a stew and an order of wings  you have to order the wings when you go there  but if you want to be healthy  you can go for the grilled whole chicken which is just as good  they butterfly and panini press the chicken  its really tasty and it comes with an entire head of garlic  roasted  im not a drinker but many people come here for their flavored soju  its a great place to hangout with a group of friends 
lets start of with the best thing ever  happy hour!mon_fri $1 oysters and theyvwere so clean and fresh and yrust me the condiments they serve are one point  the drink menu is a lttle extensive but who carrs everyone loves options  i got the lychee suju wit the cotton candy and man o man sooooooo freaking delicious  we also got the happy hour wings which by the way the famous soy garlic and the spicy wings are too damn good! did they air fryer these babies or something lol  thats how crunchy and hot perfect my wings came out  on top of that the mozzarella sticks was fried pretty damn good so who can complain not me  jsut needed to warm the marinara sauce  cold tomato sauce isn't a great taste on hot food  i also ordered the bbq spare ribs and oooooo the tasiest korean bbq cooked to perfection!!!
the food is good  their wings and fries are awesome  but there is this waitress that was extremely rude to us when we sat down  she is the tallest one in there with a brown ponytail  we were sitting down but were deciding which table to sit at (mind you  it's a monday even and not many customers here at all) and we shuffled around for literally 3 seconds and she says with her two hands laid out palms up  "which table do you want???" with an attitude sounding like she was annoyed and as if we were wasting so much of her time  we came here twice and last time she was quite rude too but i wrote it off because it was a busy night but now i know it's just her rude personality   like i said  food is good but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth  if there's comparable korean place nearby i would not come here again 
i've been wanting to try this place for a while but never had the chance to until this past weekend when i had a craving for korean food  more so for korean fried chicken  we got to flushing at 2 pm on a sunday and it was already crowded beyond belief with absolutely no parking spots in sight  we had to settle for the municipal parking garage  which we always try to avoid  we got the bulgogi quesadilla  sweet potato fries and a small order of the coop wings x12 to share  i opted for only 2 pcs of the spicy since yelpers were stating how spicy they were and 10 pcs of the soy garlic  the quesadilla had great flavor with the meat cooked to perfection  the sweet potato fries were freshly cut and fried to a semi hard consistency without being overly soft  the wings had a thin layer of breading with the chicken meat being extra moist and juicy  probably the best korean fried chicken i've had so far in flushing  we needed extra water because we were both dehydrated and it was a coincidence that their water was self serve in a green wine bottle  service was also great with our waitress always being cordial and polite  pricing was in line with the genre of restaurant and in correlation with the location  we'll be back again 
great lil place loving the spicy wings and the kimchi fried rice  the bulgogi quesadilla was pretty good too  i'd definitely come back servers are nice and foods great!!
pretty good fried chicken  a few different flavours which is nice  they offer several other comfort food and dishes  my boyfriend's favourite would for to be the mozzarella cheese sticks  the fries were nicely done as well and good portion size  reasonable price and nice service  a little wait after ordering but it's fine  usually quite busy and packed but never need a reservation  lots of seats and up the stairs is the restaurant  because the first floor is only for takeouts  they have plenty of choices for drinks as well  clean and a nice interior  i like the atmosphere but do get pretty noisy and loud with all the people  would come again 
after returning the uhaul truck from our moving trip  bf and i were starving  as his last meal in nyc  he wanted some wings stat  this place is less than 10min walk from uhaul  great! it was a saturday night around 9pm  so i was scared we'd have to wait  but we didn't have to wait at all  the place has two entrances and is popping with loud clubbing music  which was fun order  half spicy  half soy garlic chicken wings  so crispy and good  great double frying execution! have to say these wings are better than any kfc wings in koreatown manhattan  the spicy wings were super spicy though that even the bf made a comment about it  comes with a side of pickled radish and corn slaw   sweet potato fries  soft and slightly crispy  no crunch  kind of reminds of mcd fries but sweet potato flavored  not my favorite kind  the texture seems to smooth and not made by simply cutting up sweet potatoes  comes with ketchup and honey  blue cheese sauce  the honey  blue cheese sauce is interesting   overall  i'm happy we filled our hungry stomaches with chicken  biggest pet peeve of mine was the slow food service  it must be a small kitchen or something  i had direct view of where the food was coming out  drinks were fast  but not the food  we got our order of fries first and ate it all before the wings came out  bf ordered mozz sticks  but those didn't come out and we were too tired of waiting  so just asked for the check  luckily  they didn't charge us  bathroom was relatively clean  but there was no soap 
i had high hopes for this place but the food was b+ at most  i would only go there for the happy hour  you can get better wings and food at other establishments 
if you're craving for korean fried chicken  this is a good spot to try! my friends and i ordered the following  parmesan fries  soy garlic wings  sweet and chili chicken and kimchi fried rice  everything was good but we weren't a big fan of the sweet and chili chicken (which our waitress said is her favorite so it was kind of a let down)  otherwise  the soy garlic wings are delicious i can eat probably eat the half order by myself  the parmesan fries are so addicting  i had to force myself to stop eating those so i can eat the wings  the kimchi fried rice was flavorful and had chunks of spam in it? overall  good service and good food at good prices so can't go wrong with that!
food  soy garlic is too sweet  but chicken is a good quality atmosphere  trendy  full bar service  okay  nothing special 
i looove this place  the location is perfect since i am in central flushing so often  and i don't have to go to northern blvd for korean food  whether if you are craving for some budae jigae  kimchi fried rice or just some oysters and fried chicken wings  this place satisfies your korean bar food cravings  the music is always good and i love coming here for happy hour after a long day of work! the service is good but sometimes they take a while to get the drinks out for some reason; and the cocktails are on the weaker side  that said  it's hard to say what my favorite dishes are because everything i've tried here are solid  i definitely recommend the bulgogi quesadillas and of course the wings!
came a couple times over the years  their truffle fries are a must item  the wings are standard good to munch in but nothing out of this world  although if you get spicy  prepare yourself! i'm not a fan of soju but their lemon soju & lychee soju are great  we drank 3 pitchers amongst three of us and the waiter gave us free yummy bear shots (i guess because we had a 150 ish bill?)
came here late saturday evening for wings with friends  we ordered a large order of half & half  the wings were fried nice and crispy but the flavoring was a little lacking  the soy garlic was a little sweeter than norm and i couldn't really taste the garlic taste  we also ordered the gratin and sweet potato fries and they were mediocre at best  the gratin was nothing amazing and we didn't really enjoy it  the sweet potato fries were made from sweet potatoes that didn't really have any flavor  the ranch that came with it was definitely a turn off for me as its flavor overpowers the very minimal sweetness of their sweet potato fries  the environment was very dark and i was a bit puzzled by the tiny candles on every table that did not go in hand with its somewhat loud music 
ordered a small order of half spicy and half soy garlic wings  soy garlic were my favorite of the bunch  also ordered the fried sweet and chili half chicken  and the fried korean marinated half chicken  they both come with nuts on top so be aware if you have allergies  the fried sweet and chili  fried korean marinated  and spicy wings all tasted the same  the spicy wings lacked the sweetness but had an overall similar flavor  we ended up with too much chicken of one flavor  don't make the same mistake  service was great  and so are the truffle fries  there is a separate bar menu and a combination menu with entrees and drink pitchers 
whenever there's a new place opened i always wanted to give them a try and it was today afternoon! ordered small wings half&half no special sauce & nothing special! it was nothing difference from bonchon chicken! but it was juicy inside  ordered beef bibimbap! very disappointment! the beef were too sweet for my taste buds for my man & i! also where ever korean restaurant you go and order any bibimbap they serve a soup but "the coop" didn't! ehh i didn't like it at all! i definitely need soup with my bibimbap ordered parmesan fries which was good! the reason i gave 3 stars was because the fries was good and the waitress was nice! i'm sorry to say this but i don't think i will be returning back!
the food is decent  but nothing over the top  they had different flavors for wings (spicy and soy garlic) and they were good  the kimchi fried rice was also okay  there is a clean and hipster space  with brick walls and aesthetic lighting  bathrooms were clean  no parking space for this  and it's on a pretty crowded and narrow street  the service was not the best  because the waitress didn't come to us a lot of the times and we had to get up to call her over  there was no one there to seat us  and it seemed there was only one person working  the food also took a while to come  would recommend this place for some casual food  but don't count on the service 
policy of 30$ minimum per person with group of 5 or more  while the taste is good  ain't nobody can eat that much chicken 
i don't know a single person  other than vegetarians  who doesn't like fried chicken  kfc  korean fried chicken  is the new big thing  with a lively (albeit a little loud)  gregarious atmosphere  the coop appeals to the young crowd  those seeking decent generic cold drinks and wonderfully unhealthy bar food  count  me  in oysters (4 5)  they were reasonably fresh and well shucked  the mignonette could be better  there could be a wider variety of oysters  but this was an unexpected and delicious surprise  so i digress cheese okonomiyaki (5 5)  wha what is this beautiful madness?? served in a skillet  the okonomiyaki is topped with mayo and bonito flakes  both of which are typical toppings to the japanese "anything you want" pancake  the mild  gooey cheese was an unexpected yet perfect addition to the dish  often  i find that the okonomiyaki  pajeons  and other similarly thick pancakes tend to be a little limp in the middle  while the outer rim of the pancake develops a golden crust  the middle is often left to be just a little mushier  just a little softer  and just a little more    boring  the coop's addition of cheese resolves what i call the rim center pancake conundrum  i love this dish  even if it might give me a heart attack korean fried chicken (4 5 5)  remember to eat the chicken with the pickled daikon radish! the palate cleansing  slightly sour crunch will completely offset and complete the crisp  salty  sweet  and juicy chicken  both the spicy and the soy flavors are great  and they outclass bonchon's flavors  overall  i would hope the sauce was just a tiny bit more present  but this isn't too big of a concern all in all  i thought the food was great  the ambiance was fantastic  but more importantly  the service was absolutely on point  the waiters were really congenial  if your table hasn't been attended to in a while  i found that any passing waiter could help me pretty punctually 
happy hour is da bomb  $1 wings  $1 oysters and $3 drafts  the soy garlic wings are delicious but not amazing  i live for spicy food but the spicy wings are way out of my league  i order the budae jigae at nearly every korean restaurant i go to because i love the idea of kimchi  ramen noodles and vegetables in a boiling beef stew served over a mini stove but this one was a disappointment; all i tasted was sausage  again  i am in love with this place and their happy hour specials  definitely one of my favorite restaurants in flushing!
the coop does wings right   hot  crispy  juicy  spicy  savory  pretty much perfect   service is on point  definitely recommend 
came in around 6 30pm with a group of 12 for a fun holiday season dinner of yelp elites and the yelp adjacent haha  it's always challenging when going out with a group so i always leave my expectations a bit lower and prepare for some bumps in the road  we experienced some  but i am still a fan of this place everyone in our group ordered items to share so i was able to try a few different things  i ordered some soy garlic wings (6 for $6 off the happy hour menu) and i was happy with my choice   wings were nice and meaty  crispy with a great flavor  others that tried the spicy wings as well thought the soy garlic were better  i tried the bulgogi quesadilla and thought it was decent  i tried some of this spicy dish pictured in my review  spicy rice cake   it had a hell of a kick which i really liked  the chicken gizzards  which i thought i would hate surprised me! the were nice and crispy and seems like a perfect accompaniment to the lagunitas i ordered   a nice basket to share with a beer drinking buddy!the server seemed to forget a drink ordered during happy hour  but still made good on the price even through it came late and it was pointed out to him  i did like that the server gave us a "last call" to order off the happy hour menu just prior to it ending   nice touch!  i was disappointed that oysters were not available tonight on the happy hour menu they were listed for $1 each with 6 minimum the music is pumping here  crazy movies projected onto the wall  the place gets loud and is made for hanging out  i think it is good for a group especially during happy hour (3 7pm)  the owner was really friendly when he saw me waiting for the bathroom he said i could use the ladies room and that it was ok since he is the owner! after i exited he asked how i liked it and i told him it was lovely  as i was leaving he gave me a nice handshake and asked how i enjoyed everything  which i replied honestly   i had a great time especially with the fantastic company!
excellent wings  love this place great ambiance and it's open late ! really enjoyed the sliders and the korean flavor wings  the staff is excellent  attentive and very accommodating  will definitely be back 
rating will be 3 5 starsi always wanted to try the coop since they opened last year so i finally crossed off my bookmarks  i made a reservation on monday for tonight's dinner at 6 30pm for my group of 12 people  man i hate bench seats and they are super uncomfortable with no back support  there's no closet to check your bulky winter coats but luckily there was an emptied little table were we just stacked up all our jackets   of course i asked the bartender if it was okay to do so  as my friends slowly arrives to the restaurant  no one even bother to bring us menus and one of my friends had to go and retrieve two  why do customers have to go retrieve menus on our own   doesn't make sense  that friend also pointed out about happy hour ending at 7pm and it was already 6 38pm so we cramped our happy hour order in first happy hour drink specials a few people at my table ordered draught beer malibu bay breeze (1)sex on the beach (1) white russian (1) happy hour menu originally my pescatarian friend wanted the oyster but they didn't have anymore so she ordered kimchi egg roll (doesn't have a description at all on the menu)  later on my friend found out i guess from the actual menu that it contains pork belly and she tried to cancel her order but the server didn't bother to do anything and brought out the dish anyway from the kitchen coop wings 6 pcs (what a great deal)   many ordered the soy garlic and a combo of soy garlic and spicy but damn the spicy wings are way too spicy for me lol   i tried one of each =) fried chicken gizzard   this would've been a yummy dish but they hide the yummy gizzard underneath the heavy batter regular menu bulgogi quesadilla (1)truffle parmesan fries (1)   very crispy texture of the fries i made sure that seafood jeon and spicy rice cake doesn't contain any meat on behalf of my pescetarian friend  thank god the spicy level of the rice cake was lower than the comparison to the spicy coop wings  the service was ridiculously slow and make sure you are on top if you order second rounds of happy hour drinks before it hits 7 00pm because this restaurants gets super packed as they have two different entrances in one fulton square  they might tend to forget and tried to argue about what your order was submitted  overall the food was yummy but the service was not so attentive! i have a better go to kfc spot on northern blvd or k town in the city!
so i've got to say the staff has completely changed since my last review   the 2 main bartenders i see here are lucas and ava  they're pretty nice to my friends and i  they're pretty awful for encouraging us to drink more   their happy hour 3pm to 7pm is great  really   $3 beers   $1 wings and $1 oysters are what gets us in   you can't go wrong  their kimchi fried rice is delicious! give that a gothe parmesan fries with truffle oil is amazingi'm on the fence with their bulgoki quesadillas  the meat is so good and so is the cheese but together   i feel like something's got to give   if you've been scorned by their old staff  it's time to give this place a another chance 
i'm just taking one star off for the chef salad  it was advertised as having chicken on it  but when i received it  there were about 3 small pieces of chicken in it  the lettuce and avocados were fresh  just disappointed that i got ripped off lol  tip  inquire about how much chicken they put before ordering lol  also their service sucked! the waiters were running around  we had to ask 2 times for our water  theres a lot of waiters for the crowd  but  they all huddle up in a corner by the bar and are just laughing  however  the sweet chili fried chicken definitely made it up! there was such a nice texture to this fried chicken  it was juicy on the inside and super fresh!in loveeeeee !
can't believe it took me this long to discover this restaurant! this might be the very first korean fried chicken place i've ever been to in nyc that serves both traditional korean dishes along with western ones  it's actually pretty awesome that they have a little of both i came in on a weeknight with a major fries craving  and sure enough they had 2 different options (sweet potato fries or truffle parmesan)  i opted for the truffle parmesan fries  which was good but i wished they were a bit crunchier it was also during happy hour  which is between mondays to fridays 3pm 7pm  so we got the $1 oysters (min  order of 6)  the chicken gizzards  as well as their coop chicken wings (soy garlic  6 pieces) off of their happy hour menu  we also ordered their special potato cheese bacon ball too  obviously  we were very hungry! overall  i was very happy with my meal and will surely be coming back 
went to coop for hh and ordered some dollar oysters  appetizer  and drink  the ambience is very casual for talking  the only thing is that the bartender was not very friendly and that was why i rated this 4 stars and not 5  the prices are reasonable and they have pretty delicious fried chicken and korean cuisine in their regular menu  i would recommend going here for any new  old friends catch up
the food and service here is great  took one star off because some 2 person tables are really small  so coming here on a winter day  it's tough to put your huge coat and bag on a backless seat  other than that  this is a great hangout spot for beer and fried chicken wings  i've ordered a lot of things off the menu and every item tasted great  i tried something new they had on their special menu and they were looking honest feedback  so this is a place that is continuing to improve on what's already great there's a tv set to a sports game   their mixed drinks are great love the atmosphere and the cool vibes 
good chicken and beer  my favorite is their beef intestines soup  don't let the name fool you  the soup is so thick (almost creamy)  spicy  and fulfilling  their happy hour selections are not bad  will definitely comeback to visit next time i'm in queens 
the soy garlic coop chicken here is quite good  i havent had the spicy wings myself but i hear its very spicy  play this game  eat 5 spicy wings in a row and wash it down with the spicy broth  anyway the broth was a bit disappointing  many that ive had before are in a much deeper pot this one is very shallow  if you mix it around theres a high chance it will spill over the side  the pancake is not good at all  not crunchy on the outside and incredibly mushy on the inside  more like a bad seafood mashed potato pancake  the truffle fries are alright  the spicy rice cake  dish had a few rice cakes ontop but the bottom was all ramen noodles  service was good  the waitress was attentive and checked on our table throughout the night
nice atmosphere and friendly service  the food was decent  had the coop wings and parm fries  the fries were great  but $10 for the plate is a little pricy  the wings were well cooked and very crispy (yum!)  however i didn't love the flavors of the wings 
the chicken is okay  not the best  but not bad either food  (3 5) the chicken was well cooked and properly seasoned  the chicken was not bad  but i have definitely had better  the soy flavor was okay and the spicy was on the spicier side  the fries and sides that came with the chicken were also okay  ambiance service  (4 5) the waiting staff were courteous and the tables were clean  food came out on time and was hot  the place is pretty hip and dimly lit  definitely geared towards the younger crowd  place was not too busy even on a weekend dinner value overall  (3 5) i would give this place 3 5 stars because the food won't wow you  but its worth checking out if you crave korean chicken and you are in the area  not worth a long commune for though  korean fried chicken is usually pricey and the prices here were not too bad 
soy garlic chicken  are by far the best thing on the menu   gret place  great food and really nice waitresses   the only thing is that you wait a long time  there are only 2 waitress for the whole place 
so to start i like how this restaurant feels  it's more of a night time bar snack dinner location  their selection of food is a very good variety  i like how they serve fried chicken  to budei hot pots  to la shortribs  this place has it all  i can't say that the flavor is full 5 star review but with the selections mixed with quality i give this a full 4 star 
came here for the korean fried chicken just in time for happy hour! we ordered half spicy and half soy garlic; both very good! i am taking away one star due to the slow service   plus we had to ask our waitress multiple times to refill our waters 
stopped by here for lunch with my sister  we both heard good things about this place and liked what we saw on yelp  so we decided to see for ourselves  after a (super long) time looking at the menu  we ordered the crispy yangneom chicken and spicy rice cake entree  the chicken was pretty good  but it wasn't amazing or spectacular  the best part was the sauce  and the little pot of salad (it had corn and some other veggies in it  mixed with a sauce) on the side i thought the spicy rice cake dish was a bit underwhelming  it came in a pretty big dish that was filled with sliced fish cakes  carrots  and rice cakes  there was also some ramen in there   the amount looked like half a package of the kind of ramen you get at the store  for the price ($12)  my sister and i thought there should've been more than an assortment of foods that we could've gotten at the grocery store  given all of this  i won't order it again in future visits and will give another entree on their menu a try overall  i give this place a 3 5 out of 5 stars  i wouldn't call myself a fan  but i will like to come back and try some of their other menu items 
i genuinely love this place  their drinks? on point  their apps? on point  i can't imagine a better place for kfc (korean fried chicken) than this place  i went with a friend last night & there was a decent crowd  not too busy  our our meals came out in a timely manner  their waitstaff was so attentive  i was impressed  this was my second time here  so it amazed me that they were consistent with great service  will definitely be back 
my colleagues and i stopped by for a quick lunch  we only had takeout so i can only rate the food  i don't travel to flushing too often but i wish did because i would visit the coop all the time  the chicken wings were amazing  between 4 of us we split two large orders of wings (spicy and soy garlic) like i mentioned the wings were amazing  the takeout order was pretty quick too i took a quick peak at the restaurant and it seems like a real  cool and hip place to enjoy lunch  dinner and drinks with friends  if you're not familiar with this part of queens and need a bite to eat  you won't be disappointed at the coop they accept credit cards  good for kids and are opened late 
my first time trying this place  and i liked it a lot  they have 2 flavors for the fried chicken   soy garlic or spicy  the spicy was too spicy for me  personally but i loved the soy garlic  we also got the jjigae stew  which was yummy  it came with ramen and rice cake  which i love  they put it on a mini steamer thing on ur table  so the dish stays warm the entire time!we also got bulgogi bibimbap  which i wasn't a huge fan of  they serve it on a regular plate with cold veggies  i prefer the hot stone version  food came out pretty quickly  not much in the way of side dishes  we got a small dish of regular kimchi basically 
the atmosphere was a modern korean style  people greet you in korean when you first walk in  i sat at the bar so i'm not sure how the service is at the table  i had a lychee martini and a flushing ice tea  the lychee martini had lychee fruits in it which was awesome! the tea was really strong just like a long island and it gets the job done  the menu had interesting options such as a bulgogi sliders which sounded wonderful  the prices are a bit high for flushing but i'm sure it's worth it 
woot! finally a korean friend chicken place in downtown flushing!  if you're in the area and have no idea where to eat  then come to the coop  i assure you that this is the ultimate destination to meetup and catch up with friends  you can't go wrong with anything here  really  chicken and beer  what more could you possibly want?! *throws bone over shoulder* having been here 4 5 times(the first time was a few days after grand opening)  i have tried most of the things on the menu 1  half and half(soy garlic spicy wings)   typical flavored wings; nice crisp texture; not too greasy  2  bulgogi quesadilla  comes with sides of salad dressed in a sauce with a deep  wine taste and a heavy cream dipping sauce  not bad  but not mind blowing either 3  sweet potato fries  i love sweet potato  and fries  before guys  crisp texture with hints of sweetness 4  oysters  fresh and delish  served raw 5  seafood cream udon   lots of different seafood(clams med  sized shrimp) hidden in a puddle of cream amongst waves of udon  it's a bit heavy on the palate  6  fried chicken gizzards  tastes great dipped in the sesame oil and slathered with the cheese fondue  #foodporn  i wouldn't really get this again  in terms of texture  it's tiring to chew  7  mozzarella cheese and pumpkin fondue  melted cheese with a pumpkin purée center! perfect accompaniment to the wings and fried chicken gizzards  note  this is simply a pan of cheese with nothing else  no bread  zip  nada  8  truffle fries  fries fried in truffle oil  pretty typical  9  bulgogi sliders  stay away! bulgogi was dry and wasn't marinated enough  comes with a generous serving of fries tho 10  kimchi fried rice  it comes with sunny side up! aww!!! it literally tastes like kimchi  fried  rice  you can find this at any korean restaurant or make it yourself   p
food was great  the oysters were good  $1 each on happy hours  the wings we got were half and half  the soy garlic was very delicious and the spicy was actually very spicy  so if you can't really handle that much spice  just get the soygarlic  it's also very awesome  the quesadilla was very good! the seafood pancake was a little too thick and not too well done that it tasted still mushy inside  finally for the strawberry soju it wasn't that strong  i'm 105 pounds and i didn't even get a little feeling from drinking most of pitcher (more than 3 4)  service was awesomethe decor was clean and neat 
this is my second fav korean fried chicken wing place in the world  spicy garlic ftw! the bartender was attentive and the bar specials were pretty decent  it's like a sports bar but also good for dates 
i was craving some korean food and some drinks so i found this place close by where i was getting my car fixed  i paid for parking by the parking garage it's like $4 00 $7 00 an hour  i love the food there oh my goodness  the wings were perfectly crispy and juicy with the right amount of sauce  and the ribs with the melted cheese was heaven ! if you're still relatively new with korean food the staff helps you pick out food and everything ! this place has a lot of different customers which was nice seeing a lot of people enjoying korean cuisine  next time i want to try the kimchi pasta
i was wrong when i first rated this 3 stars  after trying out other korean fried chicken places  i realized the prices for the wings at the coop were fair and the soy garlic chicken is unbeatable  i love the truffle fries  but find the other appetizers overpriced at over $10  i've been here three times now for the soy garlic and the flavor is consistently phenomenal  the ambience is also interesting  dark and modern but very clean 
my son and i went to try out the place  we love korean wings  so we ordered 20 spicy garlic wings  it wasn't too crowded  the service was good although the table next to us got forgotten  but here's the important thing    the food! the wings were nice and big and the sauce was flavorful  when i asked my son what he thought  he said  "eh  not as good as kiyo chan " true  kiyo chan's sauce was better but their wings were tiny (the one on northern blvd  is closed)  and compared to mad for chicken? i guess mad for chicken edges it out  but mad for chicken takes forever for the order to come out  so i think the coop will be my go to place for korean wings  we also ordered the bacon wrapped potato  it's very good but very bad for you  definitely should try 
their bossam is pretty popping  their chicken wings and seafood udon isn't that great  these chicken wings are so small i cant say if its worth the price or not  unless you go during happy hours  as for the seafood udon  their "garlic bread" are just stale croutons they put and mix into the noodles to try to hide how old these croutons actually are  was not happy with this dish  especiallyfor how costly it is 
their lunch special only lowers the price by $2  $3 on average per dish from what i saw and compared on the regular menu  but it is super empty  peaceful and quiet   completely different from their night scene    a sea of people lol
my new fave korean chicken spot! located in the revamped section of prince street in downtown flushing  this joint has a lot to offer with a cool hip vibe for locals and tourists staying at hotels nearby  the interiors are clean and new and have several big screen tvs for people to watch sports or kpop videos  music might be super loud but that's always the case of a young bar scene  the bathrooms though were not clean that day was my only complaint!server was attentive and explained to us what the situation was with their sauces  although they ran out of their sauce that night (it was labor day weekend)  we were able to get alternatives which made up for the loss  we ordered their yuzu alcoholic drink which went down smoothly  it was like drinking lemon tea that it hit the spot  highly recommend it with two or more people  the wings were great and the bulgolgi gratin was filling as we wanted rice to compliment our protein  the truffle fries were good too but nothing out of this world  a good side dish!
the ambience was modern and good for hangout with friends  i ordered the chicken it was nice it was not spicy  if you are not a spicy person and you just want a hint of spiciness do not order the spicy that they have its super spicy! i mean most asian spicy food is totally hot  i really like my experience the service are laid back and you can feel the asian inspire cuisine they have with a modern effect the music was loud cant really talk much  ( what do you expect its like a bar and many people)
order the truffle parmesan fries! happy hour offers 6 coop wings for $6; great deal and super delish! peach soju is good as well!
menu changed since i last went! the place was really empty except a few people at the bar and at the tables i had the cheese ddukboki  small order of soy garlic wings  and truffle fries i've got to say i'm not a big fan of ddukboki but however the one here tasted really good  a nice mix between sweet and spicy!food came out on a timely manner and the bill came out to around 39$ and we just paid 47 after tip & tax 
this place is good for chicken and drinks  the servers are generally nice except for one dude  the service is slow even when there's not that many people so expect to wait a while for your food  the seafood pancake here is often undercooked so be careful  i tried sending it back one time and they just bought out another one which was burnt on the outside and still raw on the inside  my favorite drink here is probably the gummy bear shooter 
pros  theres a wide variety of food and there's a happy hour where oysters are $1 each and other cheap eats  cons  the food takes forever to come out  a friend and i have been there a few times and ordered the truffle parm  fries and a dozen oysters every time  however  the fries come out first and then the oysters come out ten minutes after we're done with the fries  the oysters are also very small  in my opinion  they're $1 each  so don't have much expectations regarding the serving size  they skimp out on other dishes  but still tastes good  service is okay  they don't check up on you other than when your table is completely out of water 
yummy! a hip place to have dinner and grab some drinks with friends in downtown flushing  it is located on the 2nd floor of the one fulton square plaza if you have trouble finding it  the place is not usually filled so no reservation needed  i have been here twice and had fried wings and mozzarella fondue both of the time  the crunchy and juicy wings come in two flavors  soy & garlic and spicy  now if you're not very confident in your spicy food tolerance  definitely stick with soy & garlic  i'm not saying im spiciness master or anything but am not so bad either but i could hardly finish two spicy wings (my friend did so it's not impossible)  the mozzarella fondue is made of smashed pumpkin with melted cheese on top  a nice appetizer to go along with dem wings  budae jigae was surprisingly good in my opinion  i didn't expect much cause usually i'm not a fan of this dish  but they made a good  not too spicy broth here with lots of spam  sausage  tofu  veggies and ramen  i remember having bossam (boiled pork belly) the first time coming here but it was just average  they have a good range of beers  wines and other alcohol drinks to accommodate with all the spicy food  the price is reasonable  waitress forgot our order but overall it was fine  oh and a plus is they also have oysters and it's $1 in happy hours 
initially did not like place  when i first came here  i don't know why but it felt like there wasn't much on the menu and it was just a waste of money  but recently i've been coming here more often and i love it  i come with groups usually and it's awesome  i saw their menu again and realized how much they had  the prices are okay in my opinion  i usually just share all the dishes i order with a friend  anyways  the wings are delicious and the spicy wings are actually spicy! their fries are good too! i usually get the sweet potato fries though all in all  great place and i'd recommend it !
this review is so long overdue  it's a pricy place but worth it especially when its opened till late  it's great for big groups too!this is my go to korean chicken wings place  it beats mad for chicken by a mile the service is always good! (well except for one time but i'll let it slide)i've tried almost everything from here but i always gravitate back to the chicken wings  the oysters and the truffle fries! these three are the staples that i always get from here their seafood pancake and bulgogi quesadilla are also amazing!! there is a bar and the lights are often dim  there are two tv's but you can't even hear them so it's pretty pointless 
great happy hour deals considering flushing hardly has any place that does happy hour  but oh so limited drink options  the chicken ($6) during happy hour was great with soy garlic and spicy halves  spicy wasn't too numbing spicy  the chicken was okay  could be better in crispy factor  yuzu makkoli was yummy but not on the happy hour selection so that's $12 a pitcher  overall  a good place to chill after work and hipster atmosphere 
good place to go for chicken i like the chicken here it's always on point  can't say the same about the other food though     got their seafood pancake here 3 times and 2 of the times it came raw very undercooked  drinks are good sometimes but other times below standard
by far this place has the best korean fried chicken in flushing  location is big and the plus is they have a full bar  the waiters here are always there when you need them and pretty friendly  def a good place to go and eat and get good drinks!
very cool placei came here around 10pm  it's kind of busy time  but we still had good service  about the food chicken wing and seafood hot pot that what we ordered  so good  i will go here again 
wow! this all i can say  their korean chicken wings are cooked correctly with right amount of flavor( spicy) and it taste so good  their oysters are also great and very fresh  it is a great place to hang out with friends  i will definitely come back 
first off  a+ customer service  it's by far the best customer service that i've ever received in my life  the waitresses waiters are more like a tag team  they are always aware of what the customer need  for example  i thought about more napkins and bam! without saying a word  one of the waitresses quietly came by with napkins without saying a word  talk about mind blowing! it's also great to see that the waitresses waiters aren't on their smart phones on the down time  they are up on their feet waiting to assist  great job management!on to the food! the parmesan fries were fresh and crunchy  it was delicious! i decided to go with the half half wings (hot and sweet)  be sure to keep in mind that this is "asian hot"   so it can be a bit on the spicy side  the first one was hot and then it just got hotter  i recommend going for the sweet ones  the wings were fresh and perfectly fried  i highly recommend it!as for the atmosphere  it was a really chilled place  a great restaurant to drop in for a drink or hang out with friends  i love the interior design and direction of the restaurant keep up the great job!
we were looking for some good late night food and drinks and came across the coop  upon walking in we went upstairs and were greeted and seated immediately  we tried the grapefruit soju  the truffle fries  and the soy garlic chicken wings  the grapefruit soju had such a cute presentation  it came with some cotton candy on top which was nice because the drink tasted sour like real grapefruit  it was a nice balance having the two together  the truffle fries were really good  but i've had better (i'm a spoiled foodie)  the wings were amazing! probably the best i've had  the only reason i'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is that the service towards the end sorta sucked  our server failed to bring our beer even though we asked twice and it wasn't even busy  we asked for the check and a box a couple of times and were finally given what we asked for  service was lame but i'll be back for the food d
i came here around 10 30pm after having a few drinks at the bar upstairs  and we ordered 2 plates of wings and the truffle parmesan fries  i like the soy garlic wings  but they weren't savory or sauce y enough for me  their spicy wings are also not very spicy  i loved their fries though  they were thin (just how i like them)  crispy  and well seasoned (but not overly seasoned)  it goes down well with the soju and beer we were all having  the space is tight though  and it was winter time so there was no where for us to hang out jackets and the chairs do not have backs  so i just put mine on my seat and sat on it  it is a good atmosphere to have some casual drinks and to have conversations with friends  it has a coffeehouse meets club lounge sort of vibe  but i like that they don't blast their music so you can actually hear your conversation and enjoy your food 
this place has some mouth watering chicken! i got the half and half flavored chicken  half was spicy sweet and the other was garlic  the spicy flavored chicken was spicier than i expected  i had to drink a lot of water but it was still good  i don't recommend it for those who can't eat spicy korean dishes  the garlic was better in my opinion  in the end  the chicken was just crisp  juicy  and flavored perfectly i recommend everyone to try the bulgogi and rice covered in cheese dish  i forgot the name but ask for it and you won't be disappointed  that dish was just heaven in my mouth i would definitely come back here every day if i could 
the coop was a wonderful late friday night fried food choice  we randomly decided to go since we were in the area and we read great yelp reviews  we ordered the truffle parmesan fries  korean marinated wings and the kimchi egg rolls ! everything was great  ! i don't think you can ever go wrong with truffle fries and the wings were sticky tangy and little spicy drums of heaven ! the kimchi egg rolls did not taste kimchi y at all but nonetheless were delicious especially with the dipping sauce! i would come here again and would argue that this place beats a lot of similar korean fried chicken places in the area !
my cousins and i had a great time at the coop for part 2 of our "cousins day flushing food crawl " we saved up our appetites (or whatever was left of it after some xlbs + taiwanese chicken   #fat) for some korean fried chicken and soju pitchers!we arrived around 1 00pm on a saturday and the place was pretty empty  our waitress hostess bartender extraordinare  hayoung  seated us promptly  she checked all our ids (who really orders soju pitchers at 1pm?) and said we all looked way younger than we really are (1 star for the compliment ;))we ordered truffle parm and sweet potato fries along with 3 orders of the soy garlic chicken  add 2 pitchers of lychee soju and you've got yourself a good time!great service  delish food  in a space that does not seem like flushing at alll  plus $20 soju pitchers   i am a fan  )
i like how they changed the happy hour from 3 6 to 3 7pm  but i honestly wish it was till 8pm  i had their sangria which was a tad too sweet  i'm also not a fan of the maraschino cherries that were in it but if they ever have their fat tire beer in stock  give it a try because it's refreshing 
the chicken was pretty good  i got the soy and spicy  the spicy is quite spicy after 3 4 but stil delicous  the oysters were mediocre i dont really recommend gettting it because they werent chilled enough  the one complaint i have is that even with happy hour prices we spent $110 for two people  pretty expensive for chicken and beer for 55$ a person
had a really pleasant time here! the food was really good but a bit overpriced  however  i am still willing to come here than traveling all the way to k town lol  the menu seemed very limited but i was very happy that they had everything i pretty much wanted  their spam dog was really good  i loved their bossam!!! probably my favorite place in new york that can make good quality bossam  i also really liked their rice cake and the ramen  very unique and different from other korean restaurants  their wings are okay  i just prefer it to be a little more crispy  overall  i will be returning!
my cousin's been telling me about this and my bro been wanting to come here  so today i took my fam here for lunch  we only ordered 4 plates; 1  kimchi cheese okonomiyaki  loved it!2  truffle parmesan fries  it was okay3  spicy rice cake w  cheese  it was good  wish it was a little more spicer  spice level  mild 3  chicken  gotta get the chicken!! overall we ate around $68 (including tip) would definitely come here again with my friends 
i went here with my sister and brother in law for a belated birthday dinner   parking and driving in the area surrounding is awful so take the train if you can   there is a paid parking lot but i ended up getting stuck in it at a gridlock for about 20 minutes  because i was stuck i ended having my sister order all the food and i just tried everything    my favorite was definitely the pork belly with spicy sauce    the korean fried chicken is very tender  they don't have a spicy option like mad for chicken but i still ate the entire order   the waiters offered us a free shot on the house which was a really nice touch   i'll definitely be going back here again with some friends   as for pricing  i don't know   they wouldn't let me see the check  )
came here two times and loved the mozzarella bulgogi  the combo wings are a must  the spicy wings aren't as spicy as they are from bonchon or other chicken places  as for the lunch special  their bimbimbap is one the best i've ever tasted even though i prefer the hot stone ones! the truffle fries were delicious too!
good service and the portions are pretty generous!we ordered the spicy rice cakes  chicken  and truffle fries and all were executed well  truffle fries were lacking a bit in truffle flavor but it was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside just how i like them  chicken was good and not heavily battered 
nice  but more korean fusion meets american bar than i was expecting  the menu didn't impress me  however the place was  jumping with a twenty something crowd  i felt out of place 
the music was a bit too loud  food took a while to come but it wasn't bad  overall  the experience and service was very ordinary 
a great korean restaurant  their fried chicken is the best!!! i ordered the spicy sauce fried chicken  they are very spicy so if you cannot handle the spicy food be careful to order  love the place and the service are great 
definitely fulfilled my chicken craving here! the pieces are meatier than at mad for chicken and tastes more wholesome  the sauce itself is really yummy and coats the wings well and the spicy ones were really spicy  i expected spicy sauce but it came out looking like normal wings with no sauce but once you bit into it you felt the spice overtaking your tongue we got the bulgogi quesadilla as an appetizer and i usually hate fusion food because it never works but this surprised me and it worked really well! the bulgogi was really well seasoned and flavorful that it brought new life to the quesadillas i was used to eating from taco bell  their drinks are pretty strong but taste so good  i could drink a pitcher on my own just because it's like drinking candy  the lychee one was amazing  i cant wait to try the other flavors next time i come back! the crowd is also pretty young too but it compliments the trendy vibe the restaurant decor is trying to give off  everything works well and it's a place that brings new life to flushing main
drinks here are good  the food is good  environment is nice  whats not to like? the food comes out quick too! & the workers are very professional  i really enjoyed the quesadillas & the fries  soooo good 
best korean chicken spot in n y amazing foods amazing staff highly recommend!!!!!this is my new favor spot to drink
the happy hour (3pm  7pm) is a great deal and includes food items  the fried chicken is excellent and the "spicy" isn't as hot as they'd lead you do believe  it taste good and packs heat  but it's not like you'll need a fire extinguisher or anything   unless you do not enjoy spicy food  the truffle fries are also a must  sure  no truffles were harmed in the making of these snacks  but they still taste really good  the tap line on the beer was clean and working well during my visit  so i enjoyed a well discounted pint or so  actually the "or so" part is where this review takes a turn  the service leaves a lot to be desired  i was there around 4pm or so on a weekday  many of the tables were filled in the main area and no one else was at the bar but me  i usually like to sit at the bar because i do not have to look for my server  well that wasn't the case this time  a woman behind the bar greeted me as i sat down  then she left  forever  no drink order taken  no water delivered  after about 10 minutes i looked around the room  there were about 15 other patrons who seemed to be waited on by only 1 person  no bus boys  no bartender  just one woman whose eye contact was impossible to obtain  i finally stuck my foot out and tripp   i mean called out to her and she cheerfully agreed to take my drink order  she was also kind enough to put in a food order for me   eventually  a cold beer appeared  great  now i can be patient it took a good long while before anyone else went behind the bar  but by 5 00 the workers in the area began to fill up the bar and i suppose the powers that be thought it was good for them to be served drinks because someone did finally show up to do just that  again  everyone was quite pleasant while they were present and the food was good  the "or so" part came up when i ordered my 2nd beer from the bartender and she brought me out a full pint  that's when i realized that the waitress who had served me earlier had given me a much smaller glass  oh well  i was lucky to be drinking anything at all at that point so i decided to be grateful i'd recommend this spot  i love the decor and the food is great  but service matters   or else we'd all eat at home  i hope they bulk up the staff a bit 
i love the coop's soy garlic wings   definitely my fav and i always order some every time i come to visit  you definitely need to try them!! also they have cute little gummy bear vodka shots! overall  food is there is amazing  they play music at a reasonable volume and the customer service is great  although a bit more on the pricey side  the coop is definitely one of my go to places 
as soon as you walk into the coop its super cozy and service is quick  i ordered the chicken wings  parmesan fries  along with the gratin with bulgogi  the chicken wings do not come with sauce  which bummed me out a little bit because i love bbq sauce  but it did come with chipotle mayo and ketchup  the gratin was amazing! the cheese was melted to perfection and the bulgogi was cooked to the right temperature  food was so fulfilling and they played great music! the coop is a great date night place too!
yum yum yum ! i love this place  it's such a laid back vibe  i usually come for a late night bite  when i can convince my boyfriend to come  he isn't such a fan of korean food  but i absolutely love it  i've tried their korean army stew  and their wings of course  as well as their bulgogi quesadilla  and plenty of other stuff  i never had an issue with anything i ordered  and always left satisfied  their price points are pretty fair  and not extreme  compared to k town in manhattan at least  i haven't tried any of their drinks  but they seem to have a pretty nice variety of liquor  and specialty cocktails  definitely seems unique when i see them being brought out to guests  their service is pretty bad  but i think the food makes up for it  they're not very good at checking in on you  refilling your water  or just making sure you don't need anything  it's never really busy when we go either  maybe 3 tables tops 
very nice they open a hangout place in flushing with nice korean food and drinks  if k town is too far you can be here for fun as well fried chicken is good  decor and atmosphere afe also good 
this place is amazing! i live in brooklyn and every time my friends and i want korean fried chicken we make the drive up to flushing  the spicy rice cakes were to die for and the fruit flavored soju complimented every dish we ordered  definitely would recommend this place to anyone who loves fried and spicy stuff!
all things aside  the coop serves up my favorite korean chicken wings! okay  done  i'm in the skins is always crispy but not so much that it's weird and chewy and sticking to my teeth  the meat is tender  i love the soy garlic because it's not tooooo sweet  it is tad too salty but that's to be expected  the flavor of the spicy wing is great but i'm not good with spicy so usually i can only take a couple of bites and then hand off the half gnawed off wing to the bf (attractive  i know)  they always try to warn you that their spicy wings are very spicy and deter you from ordering it  my bf who likes spicy foods agrees it's spicy but not so over the top like they make it seem  the atmosphere and the service is fine  nothing to go on about  the cocktails are meh and the beer selection is limited  but again    they have the best wings!
good happy hour deals  came here twice for hh and another time for dinner  soy garlic wings taste a little like black bean sauce  truffle fries taste like regular fries with a lot of parmesan sprinkled on top 
went here with a couple of friends for dinner  like the vibe here  but was really not impressed by the fried chicken  we ordered soy garlic and spicy but i found both wings lacked flavors  i do like the truffle parmesan fries a lot though  i would give it a second chance given that i haven't tried the other two flavors 
the first thing you notice about this place is the nice  dark  sleek ambiance with top 40 songs playing at a moderate level  and a huge screen showing korean music videos  the place wasn't too crowded on a weeknight  came here to watch the election results with some friende  didn't believe such a nice place was located only a few blocks from the flushing 7 lirr trains  good for dates  after work drinks with friends  or a casual get together 5 5 half and half chicken   a crisp and savory outside with perfectly cooked white meat inside  5 5 truffle parmesan fries  definitely eat it with the orange dip (which they gave refills for)  the "trash can" was one of the most unique drink presentations i've seen  with an inverted can of red bull still floating in the drink  the lychee cosmopolitan was recommended to me by the waitress and it was simply delicious  service was also excellent  it wasn't a busy night and our waitress came right over every time we needed anything  no one tried to rush us out the door even though we stayed way after finishing our food to stay and watch election results  overall  a really great find in the flushing area  what are you waiting for?
yo  coop  you guys should know that you guys make a mean fried chicken!!!! if you guys had more beer options  get some local brewery beers  i would come more often   although i already do lol  always get the soy garlic wings  i recently tried their grilled chicken and glad it wasn't salty  it felt "healthier"  i l also love their ddakddongjip aka chicken gizzard  delish!!! also  i love their soupy stuff too  i hope and pray that you guys don't use too much msg  hondashi whatever lol  cus it's mad good  you guys probably do  
been going to this place occasionally for about 2 years now  and it's one of my favorite go to places  hands down  their soy garlic wings and truffle fries are a must  the ambiance is great  the music isn't too loud  and they have such great customer service  part of the reason why me and my bf love going to this place is because of one server in particular; sabrina  she's the sweetest person  and recognizes us easily right when we walk in 
my favorite chicken restaurant!!! not only does this place have really good korean fried chicken but all their other food and drinks are so good!! my friends and i got the spicy rice cake  bossam  seafood cream udon  spicy chicken  peach soju cocktail  and the grapefruit soju cocktail  out of all those my favorite were the bossam and the peach soju cocktail!! they also gave us birthday shots for my friends birthday!! so nice!!!
really disappointing service came here yesterday with a party of 8  to make things less complicated while collecting everyone's orders  we wrote everything down on a napkin  when the waiter came  we explained the entire order to him  and he also took the napkin  we ordered 6 orders of happy hour wings (5 soygarlic  1 spicy)  9 oysters  fries  among other things the fries and drinks came on time  they only brought out 6 oysters  and we had to remind them we ordered 9  about 30 minutes later  none of our chicken arrived yet  so we asked the waiter about it  they apologized  and said the chicken takes 25 minutes to make  10 minutes later  they bring out two orders of chicken (1 soygarlic  1 spicy)  out of the 6 that we ordered 10 minutes later  we ask again about the rest of our chicken  they said they would go and check  but never got back to us  another 10 minutes later  we ask about our chicken again  the waiter has the nerve to tell us that we only ordered 6 pieces of chicken  rather than 6 orders of chicken  his excuse was that he thought we only wanted 6 pieces of chicken; 5 soy garlic and 1 spicy  this makes no sense whatsoever considering they brought out two orders of chicken (12 pieces total the math isn't hard tbh)  if we only wanted one piece of spicy why did you bring out an entire order? and why did we get a whole order of soygarlic which has 6 pieces instead of the 5 you claimed we asked for?the waiter has the audacity to ask if we wish to wait for more chicken  but "he can't offer us the happy hour price"  completely ridiculous considering it's their fault they messed up the order  he did not own up to his mistake and tried to shift the blame onto use instead  great job dude you just lost 8 customers for your restaurant can't comment on how good the chicken was cause my order never came lmao
summary  decent happy hour spot on weekdays food  $6 wings  6 pieces of crunchiness  choose from soy garlic and spicy  average wings that goes well with drinks  draught beers are $3 during happy hours  had the yuzu makkori for $12 for two  tasty cute drink  nothing amazing  but okay for a casual outing for drinks and asian bar food cost  happy hour $15 $20 person including tax tip  affordable  they accept credit cards 
hit this place up a few nights ago  on a saturday night  the food was off the chain  for sure the best wings i've ever had  literally makes me not want to eat wings from anywhere else  because they can't live up to the quality and taste of the coop  also ordered the bulgogi quesadilla and they were bangin   really savory  crisp  and just plan delicious  spot was poppin  with lots of people and a great atmosphere  amazing drinks and top of the line service  i was visiting ny for the first time and my close friend hooked it up by recommending this place  i've seriously been all over the united states and other countries  and this spot took me by surprise and exceeded all of my expectations  i'll be land marking it on my iphone and is now a must visit when in ny  for sure 
their chicken is amazing  we got the crispy dakangjeong chicken (sweet &chilli)  it was very tender and the sauce was well made  their drinks are also pretty good  i recommend the paradise and the flushing iced tea (just a sweeter version of long island  with yuzu)  the music was great  played radio music and popular edm hits  i would highly recommend this place  whether or not you're trying to "turn up"  to young adults edit  i forgot to write this earlier  but they gave us a plate of complimentary popcorn twice which was very nice of them  (y)
this was a decent place   it's actually close walking distance from the subway   this restaurant is located in a beautiful "outdoor mall" type setting but a mall full of restaurants   choices were endless i had to look on their site to copy exactly what i got  even though i'm asian   i have no idea what any of this means   i just picked it   the bulgogi gratin   stir fried rice topped with a mozzarella cheese béchamel sauce choice of grilled meat kimchi   bulgogi   bad idea if you're allergic to cheese  i couldn't even eat it   it was good for what i did eat though!  mix the rice into it  and you can call yourself a chef!their white kimchi was delicious!their parmesan fries were gross their cheese fondue actually had sweet potatoes underneath it  not a fan they have free sides of rice  and i took full advantage of that 
the happy hour is cool enough for me since the chicken wings is $1 each  i ordered half and half  oh it was so spicy and the soy garlic was good  so if you want to eat korean food  come to the coop 
like most hipster asian spots  we came in at a time where most of their products were out of stock  they only had 1 kind of chicken wings (soy)  but boy was it good  one of the better places in flushing  the yuzu soju was amazing! it comes out in a pitcher sitting on top a mountain of shaved ice  hopefully next time they will be stocked up 
it was quite good  a bit expensive for my wallet but worth it  love the truffle fries
i truly love this place  great wings  $1 oysters during happy hrs  but the music is way to loud  it use to be on a great level where i can hear my friends but not it's so loud i'm literally reading their lips and constantly asking "what did you say?!" i honestly feel like i'm at a club  smh
mmmmmm had a craving for fried chicken and ordered the half soy garlic and half spicy  truffle fries and budae jigae  the lychee soju was pretty sweet and masks the alcohol pretty well  it was carbonated so that was different  the chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside  however all the flavor is on the skin so if you tend to peel off the skin  you lose flavor  one order of truffle fries was enough to feed 4  it came on a large platter with spicy mayo sauce  the service here is on point! they came by and picked up dirty napkins  plates  little bowls and refilled our water several times  i asked for radish refills 3 times and they came back each time with a smile  the interior got a nice hipsterish feel  mainly wooden furniture and decorations  i loved debasaki but this might surpass that due to its convenient location 
my friend came before & really liked it  so she took me  we came at 12 (opens at that time)  so we were the 1st ones  the place was a bit dark  but i liked the set up  service was good  price was a bit expensive  we got bulgogi bibimbap  it was ok  more people started coming in  we can't handle spicy  so we got soy garlic wings  inside was good  but i didn't like the sauce  fries are so good! i want to come back for it 
will need to come here for food and maybe try some more drinks but this play was pretty good   our friends ordered some food (some kind of quesadilla type dish) and said it was good  while we ordered a yuzu drink that was the current special going on   the drink served four people and we couldn't even finish it  but this was also not our first stop of the night  the reason i'm giving it 5 stars here is because of our waiter   he was super helpful in choosing our drinks and was on top of things the entire time we were there   when we were trying out our drink he was very concerned if we would like it or not as he was the one that recommended it  but the drink was in fact really good   i even saw another patron at another table drop their eating utensil and our waiter literally had it in that patron's hands before they could realize they dropped it   very impressive  i would definitely try this place again for different drinks and food 
5 stars for the restaurant itself 1 star for my experience therei've had my fair share of visits here  staff has always been very nice (although there have recently been new faces)  food is great and atmosphere is comfortable but i can't say i love the crowd that this place attracts  on friday night i was sitting at the bar and the bartender working had served me multiple times  i have never had an issue with her two men sitting at the bar were being obnoxious  taking pictures of the bartender's    "outfit" and trying to talk to her   made myself along with multiple other people at the bar uncomfortable  they have a right to approach her how they want  but she has a right to reject them and most importantly her friend or boyfriend has a right to tell them its wrong to take photos of her like that   these two customers may have been men but they weren't grown  they caused a scene  even got into an altercation with an elderly man and a cop  this place is amazing but i hope it starts attracting people with better restaurant etiquette  there's a difference between a restaurant bar and a strip club and i think if these two men wanna go out to eat next time  they should let the rest of us enjoy the ambiance we pay for  and make their way to a pizzeria and have dinner with children that act their age 
great spot to stop by if it is late and you need some food  they are a modern korean   fusion type establishment that has a lot of seating and a nice sized bar  i opted to sit at the bar (even though there were still tables available) as to get a better view of the television while i ate  the menu offering has a lot of dishes and appetizers to choose from  i chose the kimchi egg rolls  small order of fried chicken wings in soy garlic (14 pieces) and the gratin  they also have an extensive alcohol menu that a party of three near me was taking advantage of  they must have ordered a couple of pitchers while i was there  but they were there before i arrived and they were still there when i left   the employees are very courteous and accommodating  this is a spot that is great for large parties of people  i believe they are open late on week nights as well as weekends which is a plus  the location is convenient as well  most of the korean restaurants are located up northern boulevard but this one is right in flushing at the fulton shopping center with entrances on prince street and roosevelt avenue 
crave for some korean fast food and fried chicken  this is the spot   full bar with some basic selection of cocktails and craft beer   drink menu is simple and nothing complicated prices for appetizers are $10 20  mains are $15 30 prices were a bit high for fried chicken  $12 for a dozen or $23 for two dozen  which comes out to $1 per wing   not gonna break your wallet  but the chicken wing and drums were tiny!  although small    they were flavorful   choose garlic or hot and spicy korean hotpots at the table are pretty much shin ramen packets with spam and mushrooms thrown together  rice cakes were soft and chewy  none of that al dente crap they have at other korean joints   good for sharing at the table service was really attentive and caring   great location under the hyatt place hotel and block away from the 7 train and major queens buses 
checked this place out a few months ago and i'm glad to see the ratings on it have gone up because it's actually really good! as with the whole complex  i've been hesitant to like it but i have been pleasantly surprised we got one of the drink specials which was the lemon & yuzu soju  based off our waiters recommendation and it was delicious! our waiter was also so cute  he was very worried we wouldn't like it and came back to check on us and made sure everything was good the food at this place is pretty interesting since it's like mexican korean fusion  my friends got the bugogi quesadilla and they said it was delicious! i will definitely coming back again to try and food and get more drinks!
i love love the coop  it's the perfect spot if you're craving korean fried chicken and other bar kinda foods in flushing  wish i could come here more often but i live pretty far  (came here with a friend and we had a large order of wings  kimchi fried rice and the truffle fries  i have a thing for korean soy garlic wings and these were on par with that of bonchon's  i added mozzarella cheese on top of the fried rice because who doesn't like cheese??? it was good  but unfortunately i think it may have taken away some of the kimchi flavor  the truffle fries were so delicious i couldn't stop eating them  get them!!
i am a regular customer  i have complimented the bartender  ava  on her hairstyle and wardrobe  she once asked me  which looks better? tonight  i took some pics of her to convince my friend to come out  her boyfriend was sitting next to me and threatened me to delete the pictures  ava came up to me and furiously tried to grab my phone asking me what pictures did i take  don't wear daisy dukes shorts trying to get customers and  because the boyfriend was there trying to protect her  she was in public space and it was her decision to wear a skimpy outfit  she is making tips wearing skimpy outfits  just bc her bf shows up  don't get defensive about it ava went over the line getting physical trying to grab my phone  it is not as if she was naked  having an intimacy time with her bf and i took her pic she should be fired for getting physical with a customer 
had bulgogi  truffle parmesan fries  and 80 wings between 7 people  capped off with soju bombs all around  great food  great wait staff! will be coming back!
let's start off 2016 with a bang! 'last love' a k a  yuzu makgeolli is what's up here! get it!after hearing the buzzes that the coop has been making since their opening  it took me long enough to check this place out! my party decided to come here last minute after our evening event  we did not make reservations and was quoted a 30 minutes wait  reservations are do able through the yelp app  my party of 7 sat in the bench area near the bar inside the restaurant  we placed our orders right away for drinks and food  thanks to yelp check in  we can enjoy one free drink from the following options  mojitos (original  mango  strawberry)  martini (lychee)  and coop 'bombs'  although it was free  they did not skimp on the alcohol or flavor  in addition  we ordered the 'last love' which is the name of their yuzu makgeolli to share  last love was absolutely sweet  citrusy  and very refreshing! it was incredibly delicious and this is a must try!  we shared a large amount of food including the soy garlic and spicy (it is sure  spicy!) chicken wings  budae jigae  spicy rice cakes  kimchi egg roll  kimchi fried rice  beef bulgogi quesadilla  seafood pancake  and j jusam (stir fry pork belly and squid)  coming with a party was just the perfect idea  every dish was big enough to be shared amongst a party and goes great with drinks  food left us very satisfied at the end! to sum it up  the chicken wings and yuzu makgeolli left a deep impression with me and i will surely be back just for them! truffle fries  i'm coming for you too! happy new year  everyone!!! here's my first review of 2016!
the dishes were good  i got the parmesan fries  chicken wings and jap chae  parmesan fries were really good   chicken wings were crispy but wish they were juicier  japchae was the only thing i didn't really like the taste of  it was bland and not on par  service was pretty good and the drinks are so cute!
my party of 6 stopped by for a bite on a saturday afternoon around 1 ish  being that this place is more of a bar night time kind of place  understandably  the restaurant was a bit empty  upon entering  you are immediately greeted by a very courteous host (he also opened the door for us when leaving  props) i thought that the place had very cute decor and had a nice vibe to it   but that makes sense  the restaurant is relatively new (i consider flushing commons to be relatively new)  apparently out of the four available sauces  two were unavailable  including the soy garlic sauce at the time of our arrival (and i emphasize on this one because that was supposed to be the best sauce the sauce we came to eat chicken with) we ordered the parmesan fries which were delicious   oh so perfectly crispy and fresh  this was the delight of my meal  yum  though it isn't hard to find good fries these days    the rest of the meal was a bit lackluster  the pancake had a lot of pepper for some reason  which was interesting to me but not my kind of thing aside from the meal  we experienced mixed feelings on the service  the water took a while to get refilled  but when we were close to finishing the meal  our waiter immediately came to collect our empty dishes and provided us with more napkins   i guess i should stop by for a drink next time to get the bar experience part 
spicy rice cake  delicious af! super spicy though or at least i thought so  if you have a low tolerance for heat do not order this! sweet potato fries  really tasty and crunchy  chicken  probably my favorite we had ordered a lot not realizing portions are shareable  therefore  i would stick to shared entree and a starter or some fries if it's for two people  had to take a star off because my server forgot to put in my meal order ( he bought me a shot for the mistake which was sweet of him) 
so this is really 3 5 stars but no option for that  i'm updating my review to complain about the bowl of soup that this restaurant use  its a shallow bowl  when i first came here they use the same bowl & thought it might improve since they just open  last time i did complain to the server about it  i just try this restaurant for the second time  good for 4 people we ordered the following half dozen raw oyster cost $9  not a bad deal at all! bulgogi  it taste like its not really that marinated  it taste okay   large soy garlic chikcken wings  taste good! crispy & exact sweetness  spicy seafood soup  i inform the server we don't want that spicy & they really made it mild  it taste good but lack a little bit of salt  i ordered the same soup as before but i didn't ask for salt that time since it taste perfect before  i love the promotion on yelp that when you check in you get free drinks  service is good! all in all food taste good! but hopefully they will gonna change the type of soup bowl they're using  its just doesn't make sence because you can't get the amount of soup you want 
the food here is absolutely unique and delicious! i ordered a mozzarella cheese dip with pumpkin and it was so delicious! such a different and unexpected combination  and i would definitely order it again  the chicken is also so crispy and truly a treat with every bite  i can't wait to visit again!
fave wings spot so far (was pelicana chicken til now)!my friends and i ordered half and half of the classic coop wings  the soy garlic ones are so flavorful and have the right amount of sauce  and the spicy ones are the perfect amount of heat  i loved them both! pricewise  you get 12 pieces for $14 or 20 for   sorry not sure how much   oops  you can't manipulate how spicy it can be so you take what you get  the only thing was that the service was really slow  but regardless  i will be coming back here for my next wings craving!
came here for the first time a few days ago with a couple friends  and i think its safe to say were were all supremely satisfied with both service and food  before i begin  let me just say that fried chicken is one of my favorite foods in the world  so the coop was just the spot for me  the soy garlic chicken was absolutely delicious  sweet  crunchy  savory  all the greatest aspects of good food  their other appetizers were great too  especially the garlic parmesan fries  environment was great  service was impeccable  and i definitely recommend this spot for anyone out with friends looking for a good place to eat and enjoy themselves 
had their fried chicken wings for takeout once  it was sticky with sugary sauce and just feels like pure fast food  i really expected a little more out of it as it was more bar food ish than restaurant food ish  the pricing also sucked big time as the wings were tiny  it'd prolly come here to hang out w  friends who aren't big foodie but then again  there's a rooftop bar upstairs that makes better bar food and drinks   so yea   those wings were a deal breaker  my big advice will be  focus on your theme  if you're a chinese takeout  you'd make sure that you're pork fried rice is kick ass and people will come back to  if you're viet restaurant you gotta make sure you're pho broth is up there and when you're a korean bar restaurant  that fried chicken wing of yours needs to be really kick butt good  i'll check it out again soon  looking forward to the improvement  =d
amazing wings!!! some of my favorite in queens! also the bulgogi quesadillas and cheesy bulgogi rice were freaking awesome  the fries too  get fries!  i sampled the melona mixed drink  not one of my manly moments but it tasted great  perfect way to cool your mouth off from the spicy wings  everything was perfect  im looking forward to coming back for more wings!
great place  fantastic food! 5 stars!!! service was excellent and prompt  i highly recommend this restaurant and can't wait to go back!
i've tried a lot of korean fried chicken spots  and while i can't say that they food is out of this world  it does hit the mark on service and atmosphere  they have a great hip ambiance  especially for a restaurant in flushing  (yes  flushing  don't worry   the parking lot is practically across the street)  my boyfriend and i shared the truffle parmesan fries  bulgogi quesadilla and a small order of soy garlic wings  we also had a drink each   a beer for him  and the melony (it had the melon bar in it!) one for me  prices are fairly cheap for what we ordered  not that the food was anything too amazing  the fries were pretty standard  but that doesn't mean they weren't good  the wings were a bit on the smaller side  but 12 for $14 is a solid price  as for the bulgogi quesadilla  it was exactly what it sounded like  a cool idea  but not necessarily a must try  service was great   we were greeted right when we walked in  then again when we went up the stairs  our server came over immediately and served us our waters  which were never empty  the decor is nice  but still comfy  they have a projector showing music videos on the side as well as two tvs by the bar area 
if you are craving korean style fried chicken  this place will satisfy those cravings  it's your typical sports bar where it's loud and busy  the games of the night are being played in the background while people scream over the edm genre of music   nothing is worst than having chicken wings where it seemed like the chicken was on a diet  good thing we didn't come across that issue here  the chicken wings were finger licking good with its' crunchy exterior and moist interior  one of the best things they serve is the pickled radish that comes with your wings  those radishes have just the right sweetness and tang to go with your wings and spicy dishes  make sure you ask for more!the korean entrees were fairly good for bar food  it didn't blow me away but it accomplishes it's goal to give you the flavors you would expect  service is friendly here and the prices are reasonable  however  parking is not friendly around here 
been here many more times since my first visit and they deserve an updated 5 star review   service each time has been impeccable; friendly servers  and food arrives quickly  important note korean wings take a long time to cook (double fried) so expect to wait for that or order right away  i usually sit at the bar because it seems service is better there  overall food is very good and drinks are strong  only improvement i can think of is the music is often too loud 
came in for a few appetizers  including chicken wings  quesadilla and the cheese sticks the wings were super spicy i couldn't finish them  the quesadilla was weird because they put some type of mayonnaise type stuff in it  wasn't into that  the chases sticks were ok  over all it was ok  but wouldn't come back 
what is all the hype about? it's way too expensive and our waitress who was a young korean girl was quite neglectful  forgot to bring us water and we asked multiple times  i give it two stars for the food  the japchae and the wings were good holy crap though  not to bash korean food but it doesn't seem like it's hard to make simple ingredients  yet it costs more than a huge bowl of pho for only $8 
this place needs better customer service  it's the biggest problem with places in flushing  places like this want to charge good prices for their food but then they give you shady service  last time i was here we waited long for the food and it came out well spaced apart  they dropped silverware all around us and cleaned the tables with some dirty looking rags  the food was actually good but i was turned off by the service 
good happy hour $3 beer & $1 oyster but strange happy hour one bartender wouldn't let me order another beer until i was finish my first beer  strange lol  the other bartenders are cool  delish korean fried chicken soy garlic yummy  loud noisy  i would stop by after work for a few beers good place and friendly people 
nothing but good things to say about this place and their happy hour! the staff is super nice  friendly and attentive  always asking you if you need anything extra  they walked around asking each table if anyone wants to order last minute happy hour dishes before they close off the menu for the night! the restaurant also plays some pretty good music  but anyways lets get to the more important part  for happy hour   i got the midori sour ($7) and it was delicious! they gave us just the right amount of alcohol too; i hate places that skimp out on the alcohol during happy hour  these cocktails were dangerously too good  if you don't watch yourself you can totally be gone after a few  i also ordered 12 soy sauce chicken wings  which was also on the happy hour menu ($6 for 6 wings)  the wings were admittedly small but they were so so good!!! they were crispy on the outside and the meat was so flavorful on the inside  basically everything you wanted in a chicken wing  definitely do recommend you ordering this item! next  we got a dozen happy hour oysters ($1 each)  i must say they were pretty decently sized! they also tasted very fresh! so no complains about the oysters at all! lastly we ordered the "gratin rice" dish to share  it was basically a baked pot with rice  bulgolgi  and mozzarella cheese on top! i thought it was just okay   not much flavor there  definitely the dish for you if you enjoy your cheese  there was also no meat flavor so i was a little disappointed  but overall  okay dish! i probably won't order this again though 
seeing as how a new korean fried chicken restaurant spawned from a construction site  i just had to visit  upon entering  i was immediately drawn by the nice ambiance and decor  since it was a crowded night  i sat by the bar instead of waiting for a table now for the good stuff   mango soju   i found it to be extremely delicious  yet strong  i love how they keep it cold by placing it in a bucket of ice  i'd want to go back and try the other flavors next time   bulgolgi quesadilla   comes with sour cream and some veggies on the sides  this was so yummy!  parmesan truffle fries   huge portion  very yummy and cheesy (well  obviously)  soy garlic fried chicken   nice and crispy  great flavor!the coop also has great music and service was excellent   the waters kept getting refilled! hence  overall i'd give it the five stars  =]
after a highly relaxing day at king spa with my fellow bridesmaids and the bride to be  we were starving  we decided to try out the coop  and i must say  we are vey happy with our decision  as there were a total of 6 of us  we got to try a whole bunch of food  which surpassed my expectations! we ordered the pork rib fondue  la kalbi  fried whole chicken  budae jjigae or army stew  and large soy garlic wings  the food came out in a timely fashion and was oh so good! the pork rib fondue wasn't as spicy as it looked and paired really well with the melted gooey mozzarella cheese  the kalbi was well marinated and extremely flavorful  the portion size of the army stew wasn't as big for the price paid  but the taste made up for the price  the wings were perfectly crispy and had just the right amount of sauce on them! i was too stuffed to eat more wings  but i will be back for their happy hour to try their $1 oysters and wings! overall  the six of us left very much full and happy campers 
the spiciness of the wings is no joke  i like spicy but sadly it was way too spicy for me  i stuck with the soy garlic which was delicious! love the radishes they give out  wings are fried to perfection   the meat is soft and juicy and the skin is nicely crisped and sauce is fingerlickin good  i've also tried their rabokii (ramen+ddukbokki) with cheese   it was amaazing  love the rustic and cozy ambiance in here  will for sure come back if in flushing and craving for kfc 
good ambiance  awesome food great service!food must haves truffle fries bulgogi quesadilla  kimchi fried rice combo wings (garlic and spicy) slidersmake sure you check out ava at the bar she's awesome!
got scammed but the chicken tastes really good at least! ordered 20pc half and half wings to go and when i get home and open the box i am missing 1 spicy and 1 soy garlic for a total of 18 wings   i have zero idea as to how they can miscount 10 pieces twice but most likely will never come back since this is a horrible first impression  also had to wait 40 minutes for my wings to come out despite being told a 15 20 wait  (
i love angela and jacob they are the best people they are wonderful and friendly and so easy to talk to!
step inside the coop and be surprised by the modern vibe and cool decor  servers and bartenders are pleasant and attentive  delicious cocktails and yummy food  servings are on the small side compared to other flushing eats but we come more for a "night out" to have drinks and snacks 
i loveeeeee korean soy garlic fried chicken!! my ultimate fried chicken favorite!    just in case it wasn't clear enough  big space  wood decor   contemporary  not typical for flushing  yes  i would go back and will have already recommend to others 
i really like this place  went here for a lunch with my friends  we had the hot pot  the chicken wings and the pumpkin cheese (i don't remember the name)  the service is very nice  i think that the hot pot can be bigger lol  but it was really good  we enjoyed everything! i will sure come back
the coop has such a funny name and it should immediately help you realize that this place is all about the wings  surprisingly the wings only came in two flavors but they also serve grilled whole chickens in other flavors but did not get to try since we came here for a very early dinner   the price is average for korean food but 2 3 bucks more than the food you would normally pay for in flushing but it is fairly easier to get to than other kfc places on northern and is situated alongside a very hipsterish coffee place and some other new restaurants across from the old flushing mall no complaints about the service  very helpful and nice and even suggested that we order our wings right away so that we wouldn't wait too long to get them while we were perusing the menu  we ordered the half and half which was half soy garlic half spicy  the wings had a very crispy crunchy shell but they were very small  they tasted good but there was not enough sauce  they have handi wipes if your fingers get a bit dirty from eating the wings but they won't give them unless you ask  otherwise you may as well just wash your hands in the single person bathrooms we ordered the galbi which only came with a few slices of marinated beef atop some stir fried veggies like straw enoki mushrooms  peppers and onions and on the side was a gruel like substance which i thought at first was cheese but tasted like very thinly set powdered mashed potatoes  the galbi was a little too salty for my liking and i definitely needed to have some other stuff along with it we also ordered the kimchi fried rice which came with two luscious runny eggs on top almost covering the whole pan it came in  the rice was good not great but the eggs made up for it   some of the entrees are a better bet than the sides since a side of truffle fries is about $8 while an entree like noodles or rice was just a few dollars more  they had some interesting items like a bulgogi quesadilla and a tasty sounding omelet and stews like budae jigae which every other table seemed to be having  they even come with their own table burner the setting and furnishings were very modern with an asian feel with their sparse square wooden benches and tables  the bar was nicely decorated and seemed like a good place to throw back a drink especially since flushing has so few bars but the alcoholic drinks seem to be a little bit on the pricey side  they have a happy hour and they have a deal on oysters and you can order half of their half order of wings but it is not necessarily at a discounted price i enjoyed watching the kpop videos in the background and it is definitely a nice place to have a relaxed dinner i give 3 stars for the wings and some of the food but giving them an extra star for proximity  service and decor 
i was craving for some korean fried chickens and just happened to pass by here the other day  so my friend and i decided to try this place out for the first time  we went around 1 30pm and there weren't many people so we were seated immediately this place is a dining and bar all in one type of restaurant  we didn't order any drinks and went with their half & half chicken wings  sweet potato fries and japchae  the chicken wings are okay  but not as bomb  the japchae and the fries are definitely good ones to go for  we didn't encounter any problems with the service here  will probably come back again to try out more stuff 
been here a few times for dinner with coworkers after work  very convenient location and the food is always pretty darn good  every time i've been here i was seated immediately and the service was good the soy garlic chicken is not my absolute favorite but it's definitely up there on my list  very crispy and not dry   the truffle fries though  are so freaking good  they give extra sauce at no charge  which i appreciate  i've also had the bulgogi quesadilla  it was interesting; even as i finished it off  i couldn't decide whether or not i liked it  my friend got the chicken gizzards and said they were good there's also a cozy looking bar that i will one day visit  very nice ambiance and a great and comfortable place to eat with a group of friends 
yes yes yes yes yes a korean place that's in flushing that's not on northern blvd  it's right next to the new hyatt hotel (close to presso coffee!) get the bulgogi quesadilla!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sooooooo delicioussssssssss  melon bar in my cocktail ($12) was lovely due to the novelty factor  that's all    jap chae   aiite   seafood pancake   pretty good  shrimp pilaf   shrug  projection on the wall of kpop music videos   mesmerizing   price   $90 for 2 people for dinner    hmm    definitely not typical of flushing
hoenstly one of the best spots to go and hang out with friends  it's a perfect place to go sit and talk and chit chat  environment is a little noisy but that's what makes the spot so enjoyable  service was quick and food was pretty good too!
ambiance  modern  posh  romantic with either candlelight tables service  service was quite on point  they were attentive and nice from entering the place to providing the check food   the reviews about how the food takes a while to get to you is entirely correct  but once you get it  it's quite delicious   but then again whole waiting i was getting very hungry so it could have been the hunger talkingmy friends and i went ahead and ordered what seemed to be the more popular dishes that were reviewed on yelp   truffle fries   bulgolgi quesadilla   half and half wings   spicy pork belly these dishes were delicious  but be warned the spicy half of the wings is quite spicy! as for drinks they have a decent selection for what you would find in flushing  all on all good place to check out in flushing either to drink or get a good meal 
i order the mushroom casserole  the coop wings half half  truffle fries  rice cakes  the casserole is pretty flavorful with every shrooms available with glass noodles and beef  great to eat during this weather  the truffle fries were good and so was the rice cakes  the rice cakes were spiceyyyyy but good  they added ramen in there  like the shin bowl noodles  don't get your hopes up with the noodles  the wings were not as crispy and flavored as i imagined  the spicy wasn't spiced and the soy garlic was lacked everything  i prefer mad for chicken wings  the service was good  they attended up when we needed them and they were very polite 
the coop was worth a try  but i won't be coming back  not after the clear sexism i experienced from one of the bartenders  whom i and my (male) partner have encountered twice now i'll talk about the positive elements  the kimchi fried rice was filling and well balanced (thanks to the eggs and ham)  and the soy garlic wings were just to my taste  it has two large tvs at the bar  where my partner and i watched a quarterfinal game during the nba playoffs during our first time here  i wish this place offered dessert  but because it didn't  i went next door to get that and bring it back to the bar our bartender (forget his name  but he's an east asian looking man with a lanky build + sharp facial features) interacted with us nicely at first; as the three of us started discussing basketball  though  his bias towards me  a woman  became clear  for instance  when he verbally asked  "are you both rooting for the spurs?" he made eye contact only with my partner  but i responded to his question anyway  after which he looked at me with disdain and nodded once  i got that same lackluster response during the few times afterwards that i mentioned anything about the game  in contrast  he acted more animated and only made eye contact with my partner when asking additional questions and starting discussions about the basketball game  acting as if i wasn't there  though this bartender asked my partner if they could shoot some hoops together (and thus exchanged contact info)  i left the bar pretty ticked off by the clear unevenness in how he interacted with me versus with my partner   acting as if i couldn't hold a conversation with him about the basketball game  as we walked out of the bar  i remember saying to my compassionate partner  "folks gotta give women more credit " tonight  my partner and i were about to give this spot another try  but after bumping into this bartender once again  i'm glad we didn't  as soon as we walked in  i heard  "welcome!" in korean and then spotted that same bartender  who apparently was off duty and was sitting at the bar  he greeted my partner but failed to acknowledge me  again i experienced another moment of feeling invisible and the whole time i thought  "this bartender needs to cut out that bullshit " so when my partner asked me  "should we get a seat?" i instantly said  "nope  let's go somewhere else " that'll always be my response when someone asks to go to the coop  and off we went 
good chicken wings and good truffle fries  the only thing i wished they had a little bit more bar food like nachos or onion rings  but overall the chicken and fries were good 
after a quick yelp search while in flushing  i happened upon the coop  i thought it was an odd name for a korean restaurant  however  their menu includes many bar food items along with korean staples we were very happy to see that the coop is located in a fairly modern building  it's a long restaurant  we entered through 39th avenue and the restaurant seems to extend an entire block with a separate exit near the bar area  we were delighted that the room was very modern  consisting of a full length bar  bar dining area  lots of two seaters and even community type rectangular tables that could seat large parties we order chicken wings  a seafood pancake and spicy pork belly  i felt that chicken wings were just okay  nothing great  it's equivalent to ufc or bonchon  the skin wasn't thin and flaky  but seemed a bit thick  the spicy wing sauce was only mildly spicy  as for the seafood pancake  it wasn't the best  but came in a decent portion  there was also a nice sauce that came along with the pancake  it didn't have the chewiness that i like and didn't have too much seafood  but as for volume it was okay in getting me full  as for the spicy pork belly  it was served on a sizzling platter  this dish was excellent was nicely done stir fried with a spicy bean paste  the service was a bit off because i thought there were too few servers  it was nearly toward the end of the meal that we got our water glasses refilled  when we did interact with the waitresses  they were nice and pleasant all in all  i feel that this is a good hangout place for the younger set  there is a television  communal tables  bar areas that would be perfect for a night out  the music was pretty good as well  pricing wise  i think they're in line with other places  my reference point being k town in manhattan  it's not ultra cheap  but if you're interested in better surroundings  this is the place to go 
never had korean food before so i found this spot  the bulgogi was really good!!!! the wings were amazing  i forgot what my friends had but it was really good too  loved the halloween decorations  chill atmosphere  the hostess was very sweet! would def recommend to anyone looking for a chill spot
great food! awesome staff!what we ordered truffle parmesan fries (sooo good we ordered this 4 times!)soy garlic wings spicy wings pork rib fondue (tasty but don't think it was worth $24)bulgogi quesadilla (eh  nothing special)the staff were super attentive  they filled up our popcorn and water when it was empty and kept coming around to see if we needed anything  we came here with the intentions of watching the mets game  they were so accommodating and switched the game onto the projector screen for us instead of watching it on the tiny tv by the bar  it was a rainy friday night  we made reservations for 10 ppl but i guess since it was raining and a fairly new place we had no issues  very spacious and clean  it's nice and convenient to have a korean chicken place in the heart of flushing  definitely would come back for future sports games 
i got to know this place from a good friend of mine who works at a pharmacy above the restaurant  the environment is absolutely gorgeous! (the lighting  and background music  and the colors) the korean restaurant is known for making the most uniquely flavored sweet spicy chicken which left me addicted to it  i highly recommend this to anyone who is a food maniac like myself!
i've only been here once the other day but it was a great experience  i love the atmosphere and the food also tasted good  the only bad thing was the makgeolli was very light in alcohol so we had to order a bottle of soju and mix it with the makgeolli  regardless  the staff was very nice and the place wasn't bad 
i liked this place  it wasn't phenomenal but i would go back because the atmosphere was pretty cool  decor was nice  good for date night or a chill spot to hang out with friends  the door they have on the mall side is so loud  it slams everytime which is pretty distracting  now on to the food   the seafood pancake was delicious (except for the big slices of carrots   not a fan)  it had a good amount of seafood in it which is a nice change when everyone else is trying to skimp  the soy garlic coop wings were pretty bland  i wouldn't go there again for them  it comes with a corn slaw and radish  radish was yummy  corn slaw was weird  the chef's salad was actually pretty tasty  i would get that again with the dressing on the side  overall it's probably a better place for drinks  but if that's the case i'd rather head over to leaf lounge next door 
i have made two visits here and one was really good and one was subpar  i am upping a star since i feel the second trip more than made up for original visit  i love the decor  the openness  the cute waitresses  the "scenery" and on my second trip  the food as well  the coop is a month old korean fried chicken joint located on the grounds of the new hyatt place in flushing  their hh for their chicken is not really a deal since it is 6 wings for $7 bucks for hh  when their reg small order of wings is 12 wings for $14  hoodwinked  the hh is mon fri which is nice and their $3 drafts were pretty good  i enjoyed my lagunitas  they have a pretty extensive drink menu which was great  i had a few friends go on a previous visit and got pretty sloshed on their soju and mixed soju  i feel this place would would be a good place for someone who wanted to try korean food for the very first time the food coop wings  i thought the chicken was just ok the first trip but much better the second trip  so we ordered the half and half and the soy garlic runs a tad sweet and their spicy had a little baby lingering kick  the first trip the wings were just about room temp  the second trip the wings were pipping hot  they were nicely crispy and not oily at all  i was much happier with my second trip truffle parmesan fries  fries tossed in truffle oil and parmesan cheese  i thought these were great  the truffle oil perfumes the fries nicely and the cheese offers a nice little salty bite  the fries were hot and crunchy  i would get this again bulgogi quesadilla  bulgogi  mozzarella cheese  onion and mushroom  this is a really popular option for theirs apps but i thought it was just ok  i thought the filling was too sweet and the quesadilla had no texture what so ever  the outer quesadilla was completely soft  overall just ok  yelp com user_local_phot…oyster happy hour  the oyster were bluepoints so nothing too exciting but they were a $1 so whatevs  yelp com user_local_phot…bossam  braised pork belly with chives and white kimchi  bossam is a really popular korean dish and the one here was pretty ok  the pork belly had a nice layer of fat and was prepared well but i do wish it had a tad more flavor even with the addition of sauce and kimchi  the white kimchi was pretty mild in flavor  this was my first time having white kimchi and it didn't really feel like kimchi seafood jeon  seafood pancake with mussels  prawn  squid and spring onion  i thought this dish was good but too oily  i liked the flavor and i liked the crispy top but the dish was greasy pilaf  fried rice with vegetables and choice of beef shrimp pork  basically  this is a korean dish called bibimbap that they decided to rename as pilaf  it was neither  the dish is served as fried rice in a heated bowl with a side of vegetables that you add and mix everything together with the fried egg on top  we ordered the beef version and the beef was on the tough side and didn't offer a lot of flavor  this dish was kinda insulting to be called pilaf or bibimbap since it felt like chinese food court fried rice served in a hot stone bowl  this dish felt like it was served for someone who never had korean food before japchae  korean sweet potato noodle  beef rib eye and assorted vegetables  the issue i had with this dish was that it was oily and then it was lacking in flavor  the texture of the noodle was fine  but that was kinda the extent of my like 
gotta try the bulgogi quesadilla    its crack  over food was decent  vibes chill  music good  was my first time really checking out this area although i've lived in flushing my whole life! it's a nice place to chill with a buncha food spots to hit service was a1  especially sabrina & alice! 1000000 stars!!! all of sabrina's recommendations hit home run & alice was super warm   friendly check it out~
love their chicken  fries and flavored soju the servers are very sweet and friendly  the ambiance is nice and cozy  the seating arrangement is nice and it's pretty big it's a perfect spot to hangout with friends and talk for hours while drinking 
food was great  but the service was complete shit  the lady named angela served everyone like all the customers killed her family  honey was actually dragging her feet and hunched over like she was beat with a stick  brought down the mood of the whole restaurant  and did i mention the attitude? we asked for water and she actually rolled her eyes at us  wtf  and after all the bullshit service  we still have her 15% tip  but did she accept? no  the gave us the money back and word for word said "other people usually pay 18%" and made us give her what she thought was the correct amount  like  sweetie  no  u don't even deserve 10%  not after your shitty service to the whole restaurant  me and my friends loved coop before  but now this experience killed it for us 
the food here is a must  the wings here unlike debasaki come out in 20 minutes instead of 30  thats a plus  its very crunchy and sweet for the soy garlic  the hostess sabrina was very sweet and friendly and answered all questions we had with the menu  5 stars for the superb service  our waitress angela and alice  were also very nice and polite  we had the cocktail soju and seafood cream udon  everything better than expected  will come again!
randomly came here after trying to decide on a place with with a friend  came on a saturday afternoon and was sat immediately   there wasn't that big of a crowd since it was fairly new at the time located and in the plaza of the new hotel  the staff was nice and attentive  it's also a family restaurant if you have kids  menu was not overly priced and food was good   we ordered the korean style chicken wings calamari and quesadilla and they were all delicious  there are two entrances but the main one faces prince street  left pretty satisfied and you will too 
love this new addition to flushing and can't wait to come back here  there is an express entrance  where you can get take away and the other entrance is the main entrance  they have high chairs and are kid friendly! the cocktails are $12 each and there is a long list of sakes and wines available  there is also a full bar available  we got a small order wings  mixed flavored spicy and soy garlic flavor  we also got the truffle fries and the gratin with bulgogi  the gratin was delicious! with cheese  rice and meat  you can't go wrong  the order of truffle fries was $10 but you get a lot of fries and there is hint of truffle oil  the wings were meaty  although the spicy flavor is pretty spicy  the wings come with a side bit of corn and radish and they also give you some side kimchi and bean sprouts  coming back here soon to try the baked ribs with cheese dish and sweet potato fries!
best korean wings i have ever had   the crispy crunchy skin was amazing   we did a half and half order   the soy garlic are very good but the hot are better   they are hot but not overly hot where you can enjoy them the truffle fries were very good   the crunch was perfect but it was hard to wait for them to cool down enough to eat!the atmosphere here is very nice   it is an upscale bar feel with a very modern look the service was friendly and welcoming overall great addition to he flushing wing scene 
i've come here a couple times  most recently last night  the food is pretty good  truffle fries and fried chicken were outstanding  however  what this place lacks is teaching the servers some manners  not only did our waitress look like she was miserable and was unwelcoming  she kept trying to rush us out after thirty minutes  the place was completely empty around 6pm and we ordered three appetizers and three entrees with drinks  if half the food was still there after thirty minutes being on the table  i don't understand why they are pushy 
i don't eat korean fried chicken often so i decided to hop on the bandwagon for an early birthday dinner during their happy hour  we ordered 18 oysters ($1 each)  18 wings ($1 each)  truffle parmesan fries ($8)  a sex on the beach cocktail ($7)  oyster shots ($4 each) and a beer on draft ($3)  all are happy hour pricing except for the fries which is not included in their happy hour (3 7pm weekdays) i've been to a couple of raw oyster happy hours and this one is pretty good! the oysters are large and not briny  it comes with half a lemon  hot sauce and cocktail sauce  it was my first time trying hot sauce paired with oysters and it was yummythe wings were also a favorite of mine  generally  korean fried chicken takes about 20 minutes to prepare so i expected to wait a bit  they came out quicker than i thought and i got to try both the spicy and the soy garlic  both have good flavors but the spicy is a bit too much for me  i can generally eat spicy food but this one had a lingering aftertaste that made me not want to eat another  this dish comes with pickled radish and mayo corn which can probably help counteract the spice i've heard that the truffle parmesan fries are a hit here so i had to try  loved them! perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside  i also love the mixture of sweet and salty of the seasoning the cocktail i got was very sweet and smaller than i thought but still gave me a slight buzz  the oyster shots were also pretty good and something i'd never seen before! my only complaint is that it takes some work to get that oyster out of the shot glass so you're just drinking cocktail sauce at first service was not the best even though it wasn't that busy  i felt like i had to flail my arms to get their attention but at least our waters were refilled constantly  all in all  a decent experience and i am a fan of the ambience here 
a new and trendy korean fried chicken place in flushing so i knew i had to try it out! so i came here with friends for food after classes and we arrived at around 2 30  parking was easy since the skyview mall parking lot and the municipal parking lot are just a few blocks away  ) i liked the decor of this place! even though it's also a bar  it was brightly lit so i didn't have to blindly feel my food in the dark lol  the tables and utensils were very clean  service was excellent! normally  the truffle fries can only be ordered after 3pm but they were very accommodating and allowed us to order it even though it was before 3  they came by fairly often to refill water and remove empty plates trash truffle fries  very crispy and delicious! they come with a spicy mayo sauce and ketchup  i recommend dipping the fries in the spicy mayo sauce since ketchup is more common and can be found anywhere lol bulgogi quesadilla  absolutely delicious!! it's a little pricy but it is definitely worth it because it was so good! the meat was great and paired perfectly with the cheese  it also comes with a tasty sour cream sauce  definitely a must get appetizer!soy garlic wings  very delicious  i haven't been to mad for chicken for years so i can't really compare these to those  regardless  i still found the ones here to be very crispy and tasty!happy hour oysters  my first time trying raw oysters and i found them to be alright  they come with a lemon  cocktail sauce  and spicy sauce  it sort of tasted like sashimi imo  i didn't get a stomachache so i'm assuming they were fresh lol 1 order of truffle fries  1 order of bulgogi quesadilla  3 orders of soy garlic wings (large)  and 6 oysters costed each of us ~$22 (we were a group of 5)  i would say this is a pretty standard price at korean fried chicken places  for the price  i was very satisfied with the delicious food that we got  i would say i liked it here more than debasaki  a great new addition to flushing!
i've been here twice and the atmosphere is welcoming  the waiters and waitresses are constantly assisting and they are patient  this place is great for both huge groups and dates  the first time i came here it was to celebrate two birthdays  we were a fairly large group that fully took up one long table  we ordered a lot of food and were quite loud  but the waitresses were kind and patient after the mess we had made  they even took a group picture for us  the second time i came here  it was for a date because we were craving the food here  we ordered the truffle parmesan fries and fried chicken  the fries came with two dips  ketchup and what i believed to be honey mustard  the fries were amazing and i would recommend them to anyone coming here  overall  this place is perfect for almost any event and the food was really good  would definitely come again 
i like the atmosphere  the service and the food  i came here with a friend  we shared an order of bulgogi quesadilla and medium wings (about 12 wings in total  half spicy  half garlic)  the quesadilla tastes amazing  i was surprised that the mozzarella cheese really complemented the bulgogi  i think mexican and korean food are meant to be together!the wings have a lot of flavor  i think the half spicy is a little bit too spicy  but tolerable  it's spicy but not overly spicy to the point where you can't taste anything  still quite delicious  the garlic wings are also great  the order came with pickled radish and corn i would love to go back 
great place  the happy hour is the best  $3 well drinks  $1 oysters and wings from 3pm   7pm  the atmosphere is cool and hip  it's a place you can either come on a date or with friends and have fun  good selection of food and drinks  there one with cotton candy in   yes  it's that good  no complaints with staff or service 
honestly i only come here for the fried chicken since it's korean fried chicken  (self explanatory if you ever had them) but if you do come for the other dishes  they're overpriced for the portion size they give you  the flavors of the dishes are pretty bland so i would recommend if you do come here to just buy the chicken as takeout rather than dining in 
great for large groups of friends  they have a large selection of delicious chicken  but i like their fried chicken stuff with corn the best  price is reasonable and service is great  its really cozy and nice inside as well 
probably one of the best places to go grab wings and other dishes in flushing  the garlic wings are just amazing and it's always crispy and crunchy to the bite  great ambience inside for hanging out and socializing
good korean food in heart of flush   very modern atmosphere with a good bar  their chicken are as good as the other famous korean chicken  their pork belly dishes was good too   m f they have a $3 draft beer during happy hours  staff was attentive and made me feel welcomethey changed their happy hour   end at 6 pm now
this place needs new staffs badly!! they know nothing about customer service   only reason why this place gets two stars instead of one is because foods were actually pretty good   they have best ddukbokki in flushing area imo   seafood cream udon dish was pretty good 
setting 5 5  came here to eat on a saturday afternoon around 1pm  there were plenty of seats  the restaurant is kid friendly with high chairs available for my toddler  food 1) truffle fries 4 5  crispy and flavorful2) jap chae 3 5  decently good  noodles were soft3) seafood jeon aka seafood pancake 3 5  smaller than other korean restaurants' and there wasn't much seafood in it4) chicken wings 3 5  they didn't have the soy garlic wings or spicy wings available  we had to settle for plain fried chicken wings with dipping sauces on the side  the sauces we got were honey mustard  sweet & spicy (did not taste spicy)  and korean marinade (this was really spicy)  i like how the restaurant uses hormone and antibiotic free chickens  but was disappointed we didn't get to try the soy garlic wings  the wings were typical bar food sized wings  if you want to be full  i'd suggest going to bonchon  service 3 5  our waitress never came back to check on us or refill our water  we had to flag her down  the guy in the front opened the door for us to enter and leave  ps  you will still have room for dessert after eating here 
happy hour and lunch specials are great but the customer service can be lacking at times  i've been here 3 times already  food isn't spectacular but it's the closest walking distance spot to get the korean fried chicken  the decor is nice and they have a large space 
came here one day with the kids (whaaaaaatt?!?!  yelp says a place isn't good for kids  and i bring my kids anyways?!  yup  i does this ) and i found that the coop does somethings well  and some things average   hence  the three stars first  as far as ambiance   thumbs up   modern  not too dark (like a movie theater) nor too bright (like an er! yikes)  clean and not cramped   it was late afternoon on a weekend  so it wasn't peak hours (per my note about bringing my kids   at least give me some credit for not taking them during happy hour  alright?) and the noise level was minimal now what matters appetizers mozzarella sticks  i wanted one but was denied   kids scarfed them down  so they are pre adult approved truffle fries  i was looking forward to these  but was mildly disappointed   i won't order these again entrees whole fried chicken   so my youngest mini me has survived off of a diet that to date is 50% fried chicken (or things i have told him are fried chicken)  and this was a given   you can get it made two ways for $2 more i believe  so we had half of it regular  and half of it korean glazed   the korean version was really good   yummy   the regular?  a bit bland   oh and a side note  the korean version didn't seem at all spicy at the time  but when i had some leftovers the following day  the spices had really kicked in spicy pork belly  comes out looking like a pork version of bulgogi  sizzling in its iron platter and dressed up with a few squares of tofu and greens   this was really tasty   and pretty spicy   i would definitely have this again one thing that could easily be fixed by the coop would be making sure their servers aren't overwhelmed   we saw that we were waiting quite a while from the time we were seated to the time we could put in our order (i actually got up to let our server know we were ready)  and it was because it seemed like our server was covering all the tables by herself   when it came time for the bill  i didn't hold any of the wait time against her all in all  i saw enough good in the coop to warrant a return visit 
my friends have been going on about this place for months so they finally got a chance to take me  appearance   it had a nice atmosphere  music was playing was not to loud  just enough for some background noise  the place looked clean and welcoming food  we our ordered the half and half wings (1 2 soy garlic and 1 2 spicy   both were delicious   the spicy had a kick to it  so if your aren't a spice head maybe stick to the soy garlic  either way they were both nice and crispy and delicious  we also ordered the seafood jeon  i was a but hesitate  since i don't like much seafood besides shrimp but this was so good  never got that raw seafood taste or smell  overall   i enjoyed the place and the food very much  i would definitely  come back for the wings ( i love wings! ) check it out!!
chicken is good  that's what the restaraunt is known for  everything else on the menh tastes bad
my boyfriend and i came here for after work drinks and wings (our fav)  they have soy and spicy  now i have a tolerance for spicy but their wings were uncomfortably spicy  the drinks were good  probably will return because it's local 
they have a happy hour from 3 7 with $1 oysters we always try to catch  the wings  truffle fries and bulgogi quesadillas are always on point  sometimes high chairs require a wait 
i came back several times after the grand opening and i feel the need to update my review  originally i had given this restaurant 5 stars but now i feel like it deserves a 4 my first visit was during lunch time  so the restaurant was quiet and servers were attentive  they also let us choose from the full menu  i later came back for another lunch the same week to find that they only offer the lunch menu now  i was very disappointed because their lunch menu is expensive and the combo isn't great  you get an entree + drink for $15  that's basically it  no side salad combo or anything like that  secondly  i dined in for dinner once and the music was so loud you could not even have a conversation with the person next to you  i understand they want to be exciting at night but there's no reason to crank to volume so high that you can't have a decent conversation during dinner  my last complaint is their plain salads  we got a chef salad and it's basically lettuce  chicken  croutons and cheese for $15  where's the tomatoes  eggs and stuff?! besides of all that  the food is pretty decent  there are definitely some i like more than others  in my opinion the top dishes are wings  grilled whole chicken (amazing and organic)  pilaf with pork (spicy!)  bulgogi quesadilla and sliders  i recently saw they have happy hour oyster deals    can't wait to try that 
came here a little before 6pm on a friday for their $1 happy hour oysters   i love oysters and the after effects of eating oysters  so when my fiance suggested trying this new restaurant out  i was down!  he arrived before me  and according to him  they announced the last call for happy hour orders before it struck 6pm  which is a nice move!we ordered 2 guiness  2 dozens of oysters  a mussel soup  6 soy garlic wings and a bulgogi quesadilla to share   the oysters weren't the best we've had but each was worth the dollar!  the mussel soup was light  had a nice kick to it from jalapeño peppers and was jam packed with fat  fluffy mussels   the soy garlic wings were surprisingly good  but not as good as mad for chicken  both portion and taste wise   the beef bulgogi quesadilla wasn't anything special  probably a dish i would pass on next time overall  it was a pretty decent meal   i would return for its great atmosphere  happy hour deals and kpop music videos 
i am 5 foot 2 and weigh 100 lbs more or less   i only say that to say after two strawberry margaritas i am barely tipsy  pour stronger drinks!
just left the restaurant  would not recommend  food was decent  made reservations for 8 people  we were seated immediately upon arrival and asked the waiter what time happy hour would end  to which they said 7 pm  to save them the trouble  i collected all orders and wrote it down on a piece of paper  the paper had "6 orders of coop soy garlic 1 coop spicy  9 oysters" for the happy hour orders  we verbally went through each order  confirmed it with the waiter  and handed them the paper  when the only oysters came  we only received 6 9  after the other food came  we asked the waiters several times where our coop wings were  they said 25 minutes the first time  after an hour of placing the order  we had finished the rest of the food but the wings had still not arrived  a couple minutes later  they brought over a plate with 6 soy garlic wings and 6 spicy wings  we called the waiter again after 30 minutes and they said we had ordered 1 order of soy garlic and 1 order of spicy wings  we spoke to the manager and they insisted we ordered one order of each  they said we could get the wings if they paid full price for them  instead of the happy hour prices  they offered no compensation for their mistakes and tried blaming it on us  honestly  if they had followed the paper  why didn't they come out with 6 soy garlic wings and one piece of spicy wing??
my brother was recommended by a few of his friends to try this place out and brought me along with him for lunch  the atmosphere is really sheik and they play a lot of popular cover songs  we ordered from the lunch menu a large portion of garlic soy sauce wings and a side order of their truffle fries  the food did take a while to come out but in these kind of places it usually does  the wings were super crisp and fried to perfection and the sauce was a good mix of savory with a subtle hint of sweetness  the fries were great but honestly nothing stood out to me about them  for two people it was enough food and the waiting staff is nice  the only reason why i'm giving it 4 stars it's because it was a little too pricey
this place was pretty cool! the decor or the place had a hip bar with dim lights standard tables and a dining area with a sports game in the back  the food we ordered the japchae  seafood stew  and the sweet and spicy wings  japchae  average 10  the noodles were a little thin but the flavor was good  for me just a little under seasoned  seafood stew  8 10 pretty solid dish  a lot of seafood  clams  muscles  shrimps  octopus  squid  and the soup was flavorful sweet and spicy wings  6 10 the wings were a okay  skin wasn't crunchy and sauce was boring
the coop is a decent place   it is pretty   sometimes it is very loud   you can get wings and you can get a whole chicken  what you can not get is chicken fingers or cutlets  this was surprising and disappointing  one day  just maybe  they will fix this   it can get crowded at times   some of the rest of the menu is interesting and worth a look 
i prefer this place over mad for chicken whose cloyingly sweet wings is nothing compared to the coop! i'm still thinking of last night and how to get more for today!
great place to hangout with friends  i love their peach tea  the parmesan fries are amazing with the spicy mayo  the hot wings are unbelievably spicy  i didn't really enjoy it because of that  i feel like all you taste is spice and there isn't much flavor to it   just the feeling of your mouth on fire  before ordering a big portion like i did i suggest you try the 6 piece wings first  you may like it but there's also a chance you won't  better to be safe than sorry  they are a bit pricey  also the staff is kind  friendly and helpful  i love their decor  (especially the big lightbulbs)  the place is very clean! i will be coming back to try their other wings and stuff on the menu  they also have lunch specials and happy hour deals  be sure to check that out and get the most bang for your buck 
do not pay before pick up! they will make you wait forever since they already got the money! bad attitude  as well!
come here for happy hour oyster $1 each n beer is half price 
friendly staff   spicy chicken has a great kick to those who love it hot! ordered their korean rice liquor with a hint of lime delish  it was good for sharing    had their $1 oysters for happy hour and it was sweet with their kimchi rice and cheese rice and of course japchae! yummy!! it's small servings but good enough to share!
food was good and it's a decent place to hang out with friends! my favorites dishes are oyster  half & half chicken wings and truffle french fries! better make a reservation on peak hours!
pros   pleasant  hip environment to bring friends and groups up to four or six  parmesan truffle fries were crispy and hot  dipping sauce was creamy and had a hint of tomato taste  two thumbs up!  both garlic wings and spicy wings were covered in saucy  fried goodness cons  seafood pancake was okay  not worth the price  the service did not pass my standards  did not refill or check in after we were given our food
we don't like the chicken wings there! too sweet and too hard! the drink during happy hour water down         the oysters are small!
the environment was comfortable  leaning more towards younger generations  staff was super friendly and patience  most of the dishes we ordered was spicy but super good  only thing is the orange juice  it felt like it was diluted  after we mentioned  the staff was more than happy to bring us a new and improved juice 
not a good experience  which sucks cause the menu seems pretty great for brunch  we waited about 40 minutes after placing our order only to find out they forgot about our order  the place wasn't really busy and the staff was just kinda hanging around  in fact  since we got there i saw 3 different staff members actually sit down and eat while we were waiting for our food  yet we're sitting there waiting and wondering what's taking so long  when the food finally arrived it was ok  nothing special  one dish was missing avocado  one of the main ingredients  the place seems unorganized and inexperienced  ps  don't sit towards the back  that's where the sink is   loudest dishwashing ever 
very attentive services~the soju cocktail was good  food was good and the services very attentive can't complain much beside the near tables right be the near end entrance  it was pretty darn windy and cold every time someone enters or exits 
food wise  i can only comment about the fries because the other orders never came apparently it's the customers fault that they don't know how to read food orders that were written out for them & explained to  offered no compensation after lying to us about how our order was coming we waited for an hour  during which we asked several waiters about our order until one actually went to the kitchen to check up on it & then told us there were no orders pending for us they said we can reorder the chicken but we'd have to pay full price even though we ordered during happy hour & waited one hour for our non existent food  i honestly wonder what would have happened if we told him all of our orders verbally oh  & the fries were okay  not worth the price though  the fries i got are the only reason why i'm okay with yelp not allowing us to give 0 stars 
came with wife and ordered their korean fried chicken and some other small plates   the food and atmosphere is pretty much like a buffalo wild wings 
the spicy rice cake is so good!!! don't be cheap  just add cheese !!!!! it comes in a huge pan and the melted cheese made this dish more extraordinary  bulgogi was delicious too and the truffle parmesan fries !!!! i was so satisfied with their dishes and literally stuffed myself until i couldn't move  if you're craving some korean food  go for it!!
the wings are inconsistent and the other dishes are mediocre at best i used to come here a lot with my boyfriend when this place first opened but i swear they must've changed their recipe or switched up cooks  the wings haven't been the same since a few months ago and the seafood pancake we would always order has gotten soggy and tasteless on the up side  getting a seat here is always easy  even for large groups as there's lots of space  the service is also good as the waitstaff is very attentive 
nice atmosphere   ordered fries and what i thought were supposed to be chicken wings (especially since i told the waiter i wanted chicken wings)   got a week amount of fries and fried chicken mystery parts   just make sure you are totally set clear with what you are looking to order 
was hoping to find a better korean place than mad for chicken and ufc but whomp whomp whomp  soy garlic is very bland and spicy wasn't as spicy as they claimed it was  the corn and pickled radish was gross  the mango soju was good! big portion to be shared with 3 4 people 
not my first time here and it probably won't be my last  items on menu are basically bar food  they now have a happy hour menu  six wings during happy hour are 6$  whereas a small order of 12 costs 14$  a slight saving  beware that the chicken takes about 20 minutes  most of the time the staff forgets to tell you   drinks can be pricey  a non virginia drink can run you 10$   overall  it's a nice place  but the prices are slightly higher  the staff can be inattentive  so beware  overall  the food is good  service can be better 
the location is on the top floor of some sort of food complex  their are two entrances to the location  one entrance is for dine in while the other entrance is for takeout  i had the half and half chicken  the flavor were soy garlic and spicy  the chicken was really good  it had a great crunch and flavor  i ordered the sweet potatoe fries and they were not good  they were very soggy  the saice for the fries was delicious though  all in all if i were in the area again and was in the mood for korean fried chicken i would definitely give this restaurant consideration 
love that there is a great kfc (korean fried chicken) place in central flushing  the coop has that down and more! i've been here a few times and its an area different from the rest of the streets in flushing with a more upscale feel so the prices are a bit higher  but its worth it  the kfc is really good and had crispy skin  they have the usual soy garlic and you can have the option to have half regular and half soy garlic  where they excel at is the traditional korean dishes such as japchae and the kimchi fried rice  especially the kimchi fried rice because it such a comforting spice but the egg gives it a lovely creaminess because of the yolk  on the other hand  their fusion dishes such as the bulgolgi sliders and the bulgolgi quesadillas are hit and miss  just combining food like that is interesting but the execution isn't just yet  the coop caters to both the korean and american crowd and the decor is no different  it's well thought in its design with giant screen tvs for sports fanatics and a projector playing kpop yet its modern with the wood  i'll keep coming back to this place because it's a welcome addition to flushing and i'll happily eat that kimchi fried rice anytime  happy eating and remember  don't deny  satisfy!
review is for happy hour **korean fried chicken has been extremely popular with lots of new places opening and i can say coop is definitely one of the better ones! loved the open  spacious area and the cute interesting interior  service was attentive and the happy hour menu was excellent  4 dollar draft  dollar oysters  small order of spicy  soy chicken wings for 6 dollars i think? chicken was pretty small but still flavorful  got the truffle fries and it the truffle taste was strong  just how i like it  budaejjigae was delicious  i like this place better than mad for chicken or pelicana cause it's not dark as night inside and can see my friends face while eating  will be coming back!
upbeat atmosphere  staff is very friendly and courteous  food takes awhile to arrive  but tastes good  i particularly like the kimchi fried rice and the seafood udon dish  coworkers and i would stop by during happy hour or whenever we are done with work to relax here 
this was my first time here  i took my parents and sister here for an afternoon snack  both the exterior and interior decoration are nice and the restaurant is very clean  the seatings are benches  which i think is unique and different from other restaurants around the area  i enjoyed the three dishes that we ordered  we ordered bulgogi quesadillas  soy garlic chicken wings and french fries  all three dishes are delicious  the fries are amazing especially with the cheese dip  the cheese dip had a slight spicy taste to it which made it that amazing  the soy garlic chicken wings are great as well  this is the first time that i ever tried bulgogi quesadillas and i have to say i will definitely be back for it again  after this quick visit  i am impressed with their food and will definitely be back in the near future  but i will definitely be coming back for dinner or lunch to enjoy more dishes  i had a minor problem with the beer but they were very apologetic and brought me another beer  besides this little incident i am impressed with this restaurant 
my new favorite korean spot as well   fast service   great kpop atmosphere   friendly service and quality food served much faster than "mad for chicken "  this place would get 5 stars if it weren't for the parking mayhem that is main st   flushing 
ever since this place opened up  i've been wanting to come here and try because i've literally run out of restaurants in flushing to try eat in and everything was getting repetitive  i've had friends come here so i wanted to see if this place is good  my first thought that came into my head was that it was similar to debasaki  since they offer wings  i've been here twice  the first time i came here with my boyfriend  we came during happy hour so the wings were cheap  we got the spicy wings  spicy seafood soup and the bulgogi cheese gratin  the wings were indeed spicy and good  the soup was mediocre  it lacked a strong flavor and the spice wasn't as spicy as i would have preferred  the bulgogi cheese gratin was smaller than i thought (the soup was also smaller than i thought)  basically  there was rice on the bottom  bulgogi on top and a thick layer of cheese on top of that  it was mediocre  i love cheese  but the layer of cheese was too thick  it wasn't as good as i hoped for it to be  i still prefer debasaki's flavor for their wings + their stuffed wings galore  the second time i came here  i came with two friends  we ordered the truffle fries  half+half wings (soy garlic and spicy) and the budae jjigae  i personally love budae jjigae but when it came  i was disappointed  for the price  compared to debasaki  debasaki's portions were waaaaay bigger than the coop's  the flavor at dbsk is better too  towards the middle of the meal  the soup had nearly cooked off and at the end of the meal  there wasn't even any soup left  they need to give more soup and lower the heat  we were disappointed  the soy garlic wings were okay  as well as the truffle fries  overall  my experience here at the coop was mediocre and disappointing  if you're going to spend the money  go to debasaki instead (even though they open later)  the flavor there is better and portions are bigger  the prices are about the same at dbsk  so there really isn't any competition there 
i've been here a few times  each time the food was pretty good the coop is a nice change to the downtown flushing area  there is plenty of tables but they are pretty squished together every time i have come here  i got the wings  which is just like all the other korean style wings (bon chon  kyo chon  mad for chicken) style  the wings are not bad  however the real thing that sets the coop apart is the variety of the dishes for the location  the bulgogi quesadillas  grilled chicken  truffle fries were all pretty good  the grilled chicken was pretty good too the only downside i have to say is the service could be a little better  the times when i say in the middle  service was great because all the help was in the middle  the times i sat at the corners  the service wasn't that great  it was hard to ask for additional water and if we wanted more food 
more like 3 5 stars  just a nice change in scenery in this busy section of the already bustling flushing neighborhood  it's a fairly new addition  and being right near asian jewel made me want to party through the wee hours of the morning to get some dim sum on sunday morning  there's no reservations available unless it's for a party of 5 10 ppl  we got there at around 7pm on saturday  there were only a couple high top tables available which would comfortably seat 2 people each but it just looked so out of place  the only good thing about this place is that it's got a nicer vibe than most korean bars   it actually has a full bar and the bartenders seem to know what they're doing  so long as you stay within the confines of their menu or simple things  i wouldn't expect a full blown mixologist here  the people who run this place are obviously fobby koreans though   i called in advance asking about reservations and instantly knew the person was korean  no surprise there   it is flushing after all  the food menu wasn't all that impressive  definitely looks better in pictures  we got wings and fries    both were fine but if you want good korean fried chicken wings  this is not your place  this is a place to throw a small party or meet with a group of friends  please change your music playlist   it was a rave in there  it's also closer to thanksgiving   get rid of your halloween decorations  i wouldn't mind trying their happy hour oysters  but i wouldn't make a trip out to flushing for this place  you get a free drink upon checking into yelp   the two bartenders were not in agreement with which ones on the menu are included  the lady bartender said that all are fine  the male bartender said only a select few  eh? i chose the apple martini   that thing was way too sweet with minimal alcohol  they also didn't have tito's    not that it mattered so much but i went with goose after  goose with a splash of cranberry is hard to f up  so i can't give them props for making a normal one  i also said splash   it had a ton of juice  all in all  i wouldn't recommend this place unless the person who's asking is in the immediate area and or staying at the hyatt next door 
from the food  drinks  service    sorry  i can't give anything more than 1 star   i would give it 0 stars if yelp would let me  individual sized budae jjigae for $30? none of the food was worth what you pay  go to mad for chicken on northern or pelicana on 164th street for the real chicken & beer experience 
i absolutely love the coop as the to go to fried chicken place in flushing  the wings are always good and i love their kimchi fried rice  it's a perfect portion to share with someone else while getting the wings  i also love their cheese with ribs  it's so good and great for dipping for your wings in  the only complaint that i have is that their dubokki (pretty sure i spelt it wrong) isn't good  it's really lacking that cheese that they have at yupdukk  their service is also very good! it seems to be a pregame spot later in the night during the weekends 
after going to a nearby place to find they didn't except credit cards i yelped an found this around the corner  korean wings ummmm sure solid lunch  i got a small order of the garlic soy  this gets you about 12 wings  no problem  really great flavor but a little heavy on the breaking for my taste  i would come back and add some cocktails to my wing top any time 
i love their chicken wings! soy garlic is the perfect amount of sweetness added to the chicken  after eating one spicy wing  my tongue felt so numb  i couldn't taste another soy garlic wing after eating jut one  the spicy is not spicy itself but maybe it's hot  great service here; waiters kept refilling our water  gave us tissues  and wet towels  came around 11 and the waiters were drinking with some people  the music is too loud here with weird music videos of kpop  they took all forms of payment except discover so make sure you have another from of payment 
we were looking for korean chicken wings and happened upon this place  the bar atmosphere inside is pretty comfortable  it's noisy but not overly so  it's not too dark but still comfortable  and it's spacious so you're not always bumping into people  there's a weird takeout area at the entrance away from the bar inside that i wasn't sure about (maybe it would've been nice since drinks weren't on our mind)  in any case  the wings are quite good  the soy garlic ones are on the sweeter side  while the spicy ones are not overly so  just enough breading for texture on the outside  while the meat was tender all around  only thing to mention was that the small order of wings did take a while  but that's probably standard 
made the mistake of not making a reservation for a party of 8 so we were stuck near the back entrance near the bathroom with two 4 person circular table awkwardly pushed together  couldn't hear what people were saying on the other side of the table but i'll live  when it came to ordering  i ordered for my side of the table and the waiter just left without taking the other side's order (because remember  it's 2 round tables)  ordered half half fried wings  truffle fries  budae jjigae (spicy broth korean stew with ramen kimchi  etc)  and mango soju  wings and fries were pretty good  i'd probably never order the stew again  definitely not worth $29  i could've gone to mizumi with that   anywho  soju was good  low key wished they gave a stirrer with the pitcher  because after awhile we just ended up drinking pure soju in the beginning then pure mango juice at the end 
this place has an awesome bulgogi quesadilla that i highly recommend anyone try  during lunch it is $12  but afterwards it is $15  the wings were also great  the ambiance of the restaurant is really nice and upbeat with good music  but at a volume where it is still really easy to talk to other people  prices were a little high  but not outrageous  overall a great place to have dinner and catch up with friends 
the feel of this place is good  quiet and dim  it's also very clean and organized  however  it is indeed a bit pricey and the portions are not immense  the gratin with bulgogi and truffle fries are both pretty good  the chicken is good too but they are very small  but compared to other korean fried chicken places  the chicken seems to come out a bit faster 
overrated!i came by with my siblings on a friday night  the place was busy and booming with k pop music   we sat at bench like table near the door   the place had a weird incense or air freshener throughout  made it felt like a home goods store instead of a restaurant   the scent gave me a terrible headache  anyway  we browsed the menu and decided on a few items to share  spicy rice cake   lukewarm sauce with few pieces of fish cakes  rice cake  and instant ramen noodle (i highly suspect it's shin ramyun)   mediocre at best  small order of wings (12 pieces  mixed with soy garlic and spicy)   the chicken was super crispy and crackly  soy garlic was excellent  spicy was spicy (and it lingers  not like the good kinda spicy)   we liked the wings  but then again  it'd be terribly hard to mess up fried chicken   lol  seafood pancake   dry  bland  thick  and filled with long green chili peppers that packed a spicy punch  it definitely took me by surprise  i was a victim!  i came in with high hopes and definitely walked away very disappointed   the food was mediocre but the worst part was the waitress   she was rude and abrupt  with no warmth whatsoever   she didn't check in on us at all  but she was very quick with clearing the plates (so quick that we didn't even get to try the korean radishes or corn salad on the wings right after we picked up the last piece of wing )  when she cleared the plates  she didn't say excuse me and just went over my head  i was so scared that she would drop the heavy  cast iron plates on me   hey the coop  train your staff that it's not okay to clear plates over someone's head!  i won't be back!
it is a spacious and relaxing restaurant  it's dimmed lighting all over with candles on the tables  the service wasn't too bad but they could've been more attentive  the servers were just chit chatting  i came during happy hour  it wasn't even a full house yet service was lacking  the food was alright  i got the raw oyster  chicken wings  seafood pancake  truffle fries  and japchae  raw oyster was pretty good  it was fresh  nice and cold on a bed of ice with me on and sauces on the side  the size of the oysters were good  chicken wings were fried  crispy  and crunchy which was good  it smelled very appetizing  i got the soy and garlic flavor  but i tasted only a hint of that flavor the seafood pancake was good  it actually had decent pieces of seafood in it  it had a crispy outside and the inside was as expect  soft and fluffy the truffle fries was probably double fried  although very crispy  it was really oily  the japchae wasn't as good  it was heavily oily and very bland  there wasn't enough seasoning in this dish the drink i had was the mango mojito (without alcohol)  this drink was pretty good  it was fizzy and refreshing  i liked this drink a lot 
you gotta try the kimchi rice  half & half chicken & bulgogi quesadillas   ide recommend any one of these   i always come here for the chicken!
went here on a recent visit to nyc  as a recommendation  the setting is pretty nice  but usually no phone service  and no wifi  the food was pretty decent  especially the chicken wings and noodles  however  was slightly grossed out that one of the orders was actually chicken organs and not actual chicken meat  slightly overpriced for what you get 
i'm visiting from atlanta and this place is walking distance from my hotel  let me tell you these wings are the truth! i had the lunch special 6 wings and fries  the wing sauce flavor was half and half  i mean the wings were crispy and juicy  food was made to order  delicious! a must visit if you're nearby 
the coop rarely disappoints  my friend and i came here on a friday night and it was packed  we got a seat on one of the high tables  of course when we come we have to order the wings  we got half and half  and fries! we also got the kimchi fried rice and as for drinks we got the mango soju cocktail  originally i wanted the grape flavor because last time i came  it was soooo good  mango wasn't that bad either  the wings never disappoint  just the right amount of crispiness and flavor  you can never go wrong with fries in my opinion  def come back again and again  and unlike a lot of the korean spots in flushing  the coop isn't located too far out so it's easy to get to too 
i was very excited to be able to come and try this place  especially the fried gizzard  unfortunately  it was not noted on their website their happy hour excludes holidays  they did not offer the fried gizzard but had the regular grill which i don't see a difference from the frying and the grill  the wings were good but nothing special  we had the cheese fondue with the sweet pumpkin  it really is just eating spoonful of cheese with bits of pumpkin  they should include some crostini to dip the cheese in making it a true fondue 
i like the pina corona    very juicy like  my best fit pina corona here comparing with other restaurant   chicken wing comes with half spicy and half regular    it's good  but no the best i have tried in different korean restaurant  the waiter and waitress are very nice which is one of the reason i give 4 stars   oyster is fresh  i love it too    my first time tried quesadillas     tasty  crispy outside and the sauce is great    i would go back here since the environment is so nice for relax and enjoy ur food     )
i really wanted to love this place as i heard so much about it from my friends  given its location and not having to go all the way to northern blvd for mad for chicken is a plus  but honestly i would make the trip out to mad for chicken instead  first off  the service isn't that great  we had a reservation for 9 people  but the hostess wasn't aware of this; that wasn't a big issue as the restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived at 7 pm on a saturday  after being seated  the menu for the coop looks promising; we ordered a large plate of the combo soy garlic and spicy wings  a large plate of the soy garlic wings  parmesan truffle fries  sweet potato fries  seafood pancake  and the bulgogi quesadilla  for drinks  we all checked in for a free drink and we also ordered their popular lychee soju  we wanted to keep a menu in case we wanted to order more later on  but the waiter kept asking for it back; that was a bit odd  given that the seafood pancake and the bulgogi quesadilla were $15 each  i expected a lot more flavor  however  the pancake was bland and had so much batter  it didn't come with the typical sauce that seafood pancakes come with! the bulgogi quesadilla was bland and barely had any bulgogi in it as well; it was basically eating a tortilla with cheese  the wings compared to mad for chicken lacked in flavor as well  for drinks  i only tried the lychee soju and wasn't a fan if you're in the flushing area  go to mad for chicken instead 
came here last night with a group of ten after some ktv  it's a very clean and comfortable spot to hang with friends  watch sports  and have good music in the background  we stretched across a bench and ordered the sweet potato fries  bulgogi  and kimchi fried rice  of the three items  the fries and rice hit it home  would definitely come back for the great service and good atmosphere 
a relatively new addition to flushing  the coop is a korean gastropub specializing in korean fried chicken  while this genre isn't new  they have an impressive new space in the new block development along 39th ave which includes spot dessert bar  a hotel  presso and many more   the food is remarkable in that the taste is every bit as good as others have attested to  i came here for happy hour drinks and food specifically and to try out the chicken for which they're known  soy garlic and spicy were available on the hh menu  so we wasted no time to partake in that and imbibe on hh drinks  definitely a great deal for the munchies  if you're interested in larger orders  it might be best to order from the regular menu for additional flavors and options  the pancakes  rice cakes are among the other items we snacked on and they were all satisfying   decor is appropriate for a korean gastropub with adequate seating   with large parties  seating can be difficult   we occupied a large table that included bench seating and nowhere to place our jackets (bench seating does not have a backing to hang out coats)  service however was a little lacking  as they're a bit disorganized and while it wasn't a deal breaker  you might want to know it happens from time to time when they're busy 4 0 5 0
this is your mad for chicken in flushing  but mfc is my fav compared to the coop  sorry i've been here 3 times over the course of the last 3 weeks  but i still prefer mfc over it  however  i went to mfc 0 times why? because location of course  it's so easy to meet up with people in flushing  and a lot of times when i meet up with friends they want something other than your every day asian food so this becomes a great spot for dinner  not to mention they have a pretty good deal for happy hour  i forget prices but $4 5 for drafts and $5 6 for wines? and yes  they have $1 oysters  how sweet is that? their fried chicken can't be compared to mfc in terms of flavor and its more greasy  but it's on par with bon chon or your other chain korean fried chickens  they also have your standard soy garlic flavor and spicy flavor  they have a lot of other dishes also that you can get like truffle fries  quesidillas  kimchi fried rice etc  food wise  i still prefer mfc    but again the food here is also decent  overall vibe is your typical korean fried chicken nice bar type kind of thing in your jam packed prince street flushing area  nice spot to take friends on dinner dates in flushing and its a super close walk to snowdays and kulu for dessert  anyway you look at it  it's a card well played if you're looking to take your friends out to a nice dinner in flushing 
food   4   5decor and dining environment   5   5service   5   5location   5   5value   4   5the coop is a great place to catch up with friends over some drinks  soy sauce garlic wings  bulgolgi quesadillas  and truffle fries  pork belly (served with tofu) was also on my table the food received a 4 5 because the overall taste of the dishes i had were comparable to those at similar restaurants like mad for chicken  but nothing was significantly better the decor and dining environment was very comfortable and a hint of rustic feel was present in some of the light fixtures  the tables are reminiscent of ones you would find at shakeshack and the tiling work on one of the walls spelled out the name of the restaurant  which i found to be both original and beautiful  service was prompt and courteous  we were greeted with many smiles throughout our meal  location   the restaurant was a 5 minute walk from skyview center  where ample 3 hour parking was available  it is also situated within the newest development in flushing  which is easily distinguishable through its modern look and upscale feel value   offerings at the coop are priced steeper than dishes at chinese  thai  and malaysian restaurants nearby  but compared to other korean wings joints such as mad for chicken  pelicana  and kyochon  menu items seem to be priced accurately and provide a good value when considering the other four factors the coop is a great fast casual dining experience geared towards the millenial crowd and is a place i see myself visiting again with a group of friends 
food  average korean chicken place i'd say 3 5 5but my review is mostly for the awful service we had tonight  first  the reservation we made online wasn't even honored because apparently their boss handles that but their boss didn't tell them  okay then maybe don't do online reservations if you don't even acknowledge them?second  our waiter (korean man with long hair) just seemed disinterested the whole night and whenever we needed something we had to holler him down or holler other staff  third  a girl that brought out our chicken hit my friend in the head with the plate  the last and worst thing that happened was towards the end of the meal  we had bought my boyfriend dessert so we asked if they could bring it out because it's our friends birthday  we told them we gave it to the front and that it says frenchworkshop on the box  our waiter said okay and left  so we got the bill and they cleared our tables and everything but they weren't bringing our dessert  so i pretended to go to the bathroom and i told another waiter and then he brought it to me  i opened it up and it was fucking flipped! he handed me the box upside down and when i looked inside i couldn't even tell what dessert it was because it was smushed  so appalled at the lack of care they handled our dessert tldr  okay food but service was super shitty and they brought out the dessert we had bought upside down and smushed
i  love  the  coop seriously  i checked this place out earlier this month and i cannot tell you how many times i've been back! the service here is friendly and (from what i have experienced) the food comes out pretty quickly  the ambiance is quite lively   usually packed in the evenings  they have a giant projector playing random kpop videos  which can be pretty entertaining  in my opinion  the best part about this place is the variety  you should definitely try their chicken   not the best but still a strong contender  (the spicy version actually has a nice kick!) my favorites though are the gratin  truffle fries  and bulgogi quesadilla  truffle fries come in a big portion and are perfect for sharing  the gratin is so so delicious and creamy   i can order this every time! the quesadilla is wonderful as well   i tried it recently and really enjoyed it  also  they have oysters!!! definitely come during happy hour on weekdays from 3 6 and treat yo self to dollar oysters  )super convenient spot   just two blocks from the 7! there have been many occasions where i've craved korean fried chicken and had to trek to over to northern blvd  ( this is definitely an easier location to get my fix! great place to hangout over some good food and a chill vibe  )
came here with some friends for some classic korean fried chicken  the chicken was so crispy and juicy cooked to perfection and my favorite sauce was the soy and garlic  the spicy mix was not very spicy to me although one of my friends insisted it was very spicy but the rest of us disagreed  the rest of the meal was a bit underwhelming  we started with korean seafood pancake as an appetizer and it tasted a bit bland and more on the watery side  the parmesan fries was good but nothing particularly great  i prefer fries to be more on the crispy side not to say these fries were limp either  the dukbokki wasn't spicy and tasted a bit undercooked  not very soft  i got the melony drink which was sweet and didn't taste too strong but my  friend got the same drink and said that hers was a lot stronger and couldn't finish it  my other friend got the mojito whish was also strong but delicious  the waitstaff was very attentive and always available for help  the place looks very modern and spacious with plenty of seating  although the fried chicken was very good and the place is aesthetically pleasing i probably wouldn't come back here 
for my past 3 visits here  i just had the bulgogi quesadilla and small order of their coop wings  half and half  and they never ever disappointed! it's the perfect portion for two people two share a late night grub  their bulgogi is out of this world phenomenal  not a fan of the salad that comes with it though    and their wings are crisp and flavorful  the spicy ones are just too much for me to handle so i stick to my half of the soy garlic  note  their chicken takes a while to serve  i waited about 17 minutes for my order the staff really needs to up their water refilling game though  i had to ask for water refills during my last two visits  and given the spicy wings   c'mon  just pass me a pitcher please 
i was at this place tonight with a group of friends  we ordered wings  japchae   kimchi fried rice and gratin  the waitress gave us a bottle of water but never came back to refill our cups  we had to constantly wave to get their attention  and let's not forget the highlight of the night  my kimchi fried rice had hair in it; which they took back and brought back   the portion now looked smaller like wtf!
i used to go to mad for chicken until this one opened around my neighborhood  my to go place when i'm craving for soy garlic chicken wings! make sure to order the wings right away because it takes time to cook!
my girlfriends and i were here last night for dinner  and at first i had to use my gps to search for this spot but it's not hard to find at all  it's actually located across from 66 on prince street and it's attached to the hyatt hotel  speaking of the hotel  there's a lot of cool places inside it  i will visit it next time  all the food we ordered tasted phenomenal  the chef really made it well and our server was friendly and attentive too  i highly recommend getting the pork belly  it's that good that i can't stop eating it  my eyes were glued to the belly as my friends were chit chatting  what we got bulgogi quesadilla  pretty tasty  permesan truffle fries  fried to perfection and the dip was delicious!!japchae   got a lot of flavors and it was so damn good  oysters   fresh and well it's oyster korean fried chicken   crunchy and well flavored!
had an early dinner one late afternoon about a month ago with the boyfriend  we ordered soy garlic wings  budae jjigae  bulgogi quesadilla  and parmesan truffle fries  the food was tasty (we ordered too much haha) but wayyy too fried  especially the wings  all in all  the flavor was there  nice texture  and decent service  definitely want to go back and try other items on the menu 
came here for the first time since my friends from florida had flown in  we got there around 11pm so parking in the small muni parking lot was very convenient  especially since you don't have to pay after 10 pm  venue was nice and dimly lit  there's a surplus of tables to fit different size parties and a bar in the back  we were the only group there actually eating with a few guys sitting at the bar conversing over their drinks  service was very good  was greeted and welcomes to the place  the waiter asked if we wanted hot water instead of your normal iced water since it was like 15 degrees outside  so that was surprising  but very much appreciated  since it was my first time there as well we ordered what my other friends had recommended us  bulgogi quesadilla is a must  was very delicious and a great starting appetizer  we also ordered the truffle fries and a large order of their soy garlic chicken  truffle fries were good and crispy  but to me it wasn't out of this world  but good nonetheless  their chicken was crisp and good as well  not amazing  but still good and my floridian friends enjoyed it very much  overall it's a very nice restaurant  with great service from what we've experienced and a kickass bulgogi quesadilla 
i don't how it happens  but i always end up here drunk  it's the best time  food is great  angela and jacob are the best  jacob taught us how to measure the proportion between soju and beer  they let us request kpop songs  i luv it!
i've been here three times now and i honestly think i enjoy the atmosphere more than i enjoy the food  but their food is good! i normally get their truffle fries  which i love  and their coop style fried chicken  however  i don't think there's anything too special about the food because i can get korean style fried chicken and truffle fries in a number of places  and the fried chicken is bigger and a little more "authentic" tasting in other places  i'm never dying to come back here  but i'd come back again i did notice  however  that i would get a totally different attitude from one of the waitresses depending on whether i spoke in korean or in english  that turned me off a little bit but it wasn't too big of a deal since it was probably a language barrier issue; you don't really have much interaction with the waitresses anyway  they just bring the food out tldr; good food  nice ambiance  good enough for a dinner on a friday night out in flushing 
immediately as you walk in  the waiters greet you with the korean "hello!"  they make you feel welcomed and really try to make you feel comfortable and at home  this trendy new place resembles many new korean restaurants that have been popping up around queens and i'm glad that this also popped up  you have to get their wings! the spicy is pretty spicy so watch out! the soy garlic is really good also  i also recommend the quesadillas  (it's sooo good) come here with your friends and really have a great time basking in the atmosphere and the efficient service 
happy there is a korean fried chicken place in the flushing area however i was a bit disappointed in the chicken wings  the soy garlic chicken wings were a bit too salty and batter y for my liking  it was a bit too hard to enjoy since the batter was a bit overwhelming and there didnt seem to be much chicken meat  inside! however  the truffle fries were great! we were not expecting such a huge platter of fries and overall they were super tastey so no one can complain i have also heard good things about the dollar oyster happy hour so probably will come back sometime to try other things on the menu 
really nothing special about this place  sure the truffle fries are good and the wings are tasty  but nothing really stands out  i've had their seafood soup and budae jiggae  which is served family style and i was not impressed with either  i've had budae jiggae before and this was not horrible but it was lacking some favor  the drinks are about average  and their pitchers of flavored soju is no longer a slushie  i was really looking forward to the soju slushie but the last two times i've been here they just serve it with ice cubes their servers are nice and attentive but i had this female server once and we asked for water  so she just took the one from the table behind us that just finished dining and brought it to our table  i was soo disgusted and couldn't believe she just did that  again another good hangout spot on flushing but don't expect too much 
love it    ordered from here for pick up    the chicken was great! (soy garlic coop) yummy ! have to try their happy hours (‾  ‾) next time 
i like how this place is always opened late  great for late night  chicken is good but so are their side orders
more around a 3 5  they're super close to the train which is definitely a great plus  but could be a minus if you're looking to come here during a busy time  i came on a tuesday with no issues  but i can't imagine what the weekend would be like  4 of us ordered 40 wings  parmesan fries  bulgogi quesadillas and the budae jigae  while everything was good  nothing was amazing  the biggest disappointment was the budae jigae  for a $30 price tag  you'd expect something more  but the portion was pretty small  the soup itself was just a soup and not thick like a sauce and they really didn't have enough food in it  when compared to mad for chicken  i have to say  my vote goes to mad for chicken  the chicken is bigger there  the portions are much bigger and the food just all around is good  we waited a pretty long time for our chicken and while i know it normally takes a long time  the food in general just took a while to come  they were on point with filling our glasses of water and the overall look and feel of this place is so hip and cool  but for the price and the food you're getting  i'd stick with mad for chicken 
this new korean fusion restaurant has a really hip and modern interior  the interior design is really great for a flushing location! the restaurant itself is really clean  they offer everything from chicken wings to a bulgogi quesadilla when i came here  the staff was really helpful  kind and just seemed very genuine  i ordered a large order of chicken wings which were very flavorful  their chicken is hormone free which is a plus  the only downside i found to the wings was that they were smaller in size to what i'm used to  they also have a huge variety of choices when it comes to alcohol  i had a watermelon piña colada  which i thought was just average as it seemed to not have much of the watermelon taste  it just tastes like a regular piña colada to me  i also had an oyster shot  i love oyster shots and find it so hard to find a place that sells them  so when i saw that they had it  i was full of excitement like a baby getting a pacifier for the first time  the oyster shot itself was not the best i've had but it was good in my opinion and will most probably have it again final verdict  ambiance   10 10food   8 10drinks   9 10service   10 10
i wasn't a fan  although i would come back for the soy garlic wings (and that's it)  service is great  but the other food is mediocre   we tried the truffle fries  they were fresh and hot  came with ketchup and a spicy mayo dipping sauce  a tad pricy for $10   also tried a creamy noodle dish   good décor  good location but the food seemed average 
superb service  the waitress was very friendly and coordinated  when you come in  ask for sabrina! we ordered the new summer combo that come with a pitcher or cocktail soju(your choice) and the buddae jiggae which is a korean soup  and the wings  the spicy wings are very spicy  so be careful! it was very delicious  will definitely come again 
it's pretty much what i've come to expect from korean chicken wing bars  great food  excellent drinks  efficient service  a dark space  and a social atmosphere  i recommend their signature wings  they're nice and crunchy  one thing they've got over other similar places is the size of their soju cocktails  i've had the kind brought in mason jars  but the largest size they have here is larger by a pretty good margin  it's a great atmosphere in this place  i definitely recommend it for a small get together 
decent korean chicken spot that opened right under hyatt  i've been here multiple times and each time i've had a different experience  the service is always great but their food is so so  most of the korean restaurants in flushing are about the same price so i wasn't expecting anything less  their chicken isn't crispy enough but their truffle fries are delicious! if they're specializing in korean fried chicken wings  they can really work on making them crispier as well as tastier 
this place is really nice and warming the decor is nice me and my girlfriend sat at the bar the happy hour on the tap beer is great 3 dollars for my ipa what a deal the spicy wing were great and the sauce for the fries was good too overall i'll be back here for sure looks like a good menu
came here with a group of 4 on a friday evening  we ordered the half and half chicken wings  spicy rice cakes  truffle parmesan fries  and lychee soju  the chicken wings was flavorful and crispy  rice cake was good  lychee soju was good but wasn't strong enough  fries was the highlight of the dinner  very crispy and came in a big portion  we'll definitely come back again and try other dishes 
i came here twice  once when they just open and once recently  the ambiance of the place is very modern and clean and they offer a variety of korean like bar food which i love  their truffles fries are great and the chicken wings are pretty good too  its a great place to hang out with friends and catch up over happy house drinks and food!
my friend and i ordered yogurt soju  egg spring roll  truffle fries and small wings  the food was good and really hit the spot  the yogurt soju didn't taste very strong  the staff were attentive by coming over to fill our water  providing napkins and clearing our table  they were friendly and even helped charge my iphone because it almost died  would definitely come back!
first korean fried chicken joint in main st  flushing! there are plenty on northern blvd flushing  but one that is so close to the heart of flushing and near a subway station this is a winner!they have two entrances  one entrance is on the ground floor which is actually the back of the building and also where you can order for takeout  the main entrance is on the other side up one stair case  oh don't worry they are both connected so either way there will be someone that can help you get seated if you wish to eat in  the décor is wonderful! it looks like it is upscale  modern  clean  fresh  and it feels comfortable  there are two tvs near the bar and one projector on the ceiling projecting a korean drama on the wall (no sounds just video)  oh the person seating you will welcome you in korean and then rest of the staff will also scream welcome to you too just like in japanese restaurants! makes me feel very welcomed  comfortable and happy my group quickly order because we already know what to get since we had experiences from mad for chicken  we ordered half and half large (20 pieces) of chicken  truffle parm fries  and seafood jeon (pancake)  they don't provide those korean side dishes for you to nibble on while waiting  the wait was about 30 mins and the first that came out was the seafood pancake  it was a size of a small skillet  our waitress cut it up into four pieces  each pieces had big pieces of seafood  they have this jalapeno  onion  and soy sauce (?) dip that comes with it too  it was delicious! crispy on the outside and soft on the inside  the pancake was so filled with food that it fell apart as i tried to get it off the skillet and onto my plate lol then comes our fries  they were freshly made because they were hot inside and out  i could taste the truffle oil  the parmesan was mostly on the center fries  it came with a small cup of ketchup and some kind of spicy dip  the portion was so huge! one order feed three four people at most  eventually we ran out of dip so we had to ask for more (no charge)  the fries were really really delicious  i had to stop myself otherwise there won't be any fries by the time the chicken comes out at last our wings came  the spicy wings were really spicy for my taste  the spice hits you on the tongue and slowly creeps its way to the back of your throat  i couldn't handle it  i ate mostly the soy garlic wings  those were sweet and tangy  i loved it  the wings were adorably tiny  but don't under estimate their size because after four i was full!!!!! i forgot to mention in the center of the bowl they had small cut up pieces of pickle radishes and creamy corn  those will help as you go back and forth between spicy and sweet  as for my case i kept eating the soy garlic so i used the radish and corn to alternative between each soy garlic wings overall with the atmosphere and the waiter and waitress were on top of re filling water and soda and food i really really want this restaurant to stay! oh i forgot if you ask for water they give you lemon and lime infuse water in a pitcher  like talk about fancy water! i will definitely come back because finally a korean fried chicken joint in main st  as a plus it's one block from skyview mall  what a great way to walk off that chicken with a little bit of shopping lol
great food  great drinks  great service  the atmosphere is perfect for a get together over a few drinks and you can't beat their fusion cuisine  this is definitely my go to place in flushing 
relaxing atmosphere  modern looking bar   great place to hang out and have a snack or two with friends   try the chicken wings!   service is good   attentive    clean and well kept place 
i love any place that has spicy stir fried chicken gizzards  decent beer on tap and convenient to me  the coop is all that and more
this is a five star place for cold beer and chicken wings  best at happy hour and mid week evenings  too loud and too busy at peak times   the food offerings from the menu range from competent to pretty good but cannot be called outstanding   that wouldn't be the point in an attractive room with a good ambiance for socializing with friends  which is the point in this kind of place 
one of the best fried chicken places i have had so far and it's not on northern blvd  it's easily accessible in flushing by train  d! awesomesauce! i came here on a thursday night and thankfully there was no wait considering my friend said it's pretty busy all the time  we ordered 20 pieces of soy garlic wings  kimchee fried rice  and the seafood pancake  the soy garlic wings were just simply delicious  it was very flavorful  crunchy and meaty  the kimchee fried rice was also yummy  there were two sunny side up eggs and seaweeds that made a face  which is pretty unique  the seafood pancake was stuffed with fillings  my friend tried to pick up a slice and a lot of excess fell off  the server helps you cut the pancake into 8 pieces when it's served  the services were great also besides the fact that it took a while to wave down a worker to take down our order and get our check  the workers would come over and refill our cup every time it's half emptied  when our chicken wings came  my friends and i realized there weren't 20 pieces and notified one of the workers  the worker simply apologized  although she looked confused herself  and went back into the kitchen to get us the rest of our wings  i had a great experience overall and i will definitely come back to try other things on the menu!
the coop has been open for a couple of months now  when i take a trip to visit my family and friends  this is always the spot that i have to eat at before i go back to northeastern! i absolutely love the $1 oysters during happy hour on the weekdays  before this spot  i would always have to travel to the city to get my oyster fix  but ever since this restaurant  it has made life so much more convenient (especially after already traveling 4 hours from boston to queens  i really don't want to take more public transportation to get to the city) these oysters are definitely one of the freshest oysters i've ever had  one of the dishes that has been part of my "regular" order when i eat here is definitely the bulgogi quesadilla  i honestly don't know what they put in it  but it's definitely addicting! other dishes that i've had  truffle fries  mozarella fondue  bulgogi gratin  the seafood soup  kimchi fried rice are all very delicious  the atmosphere of this restaurant is great  it's definitely for the younger crowd  the restaurant is very modern and when you enter the restaurant  everyone gives you a warm welcome  ) if you're in the mood for some amazing korean food  definitely give this place a try!
really liked it here! this place is in this cute area surrounded by other restaurants  it's like this corner that leads to a strip of food places  it's new and has a modern vibe  i got the nurungji tang ($29) with rice and shared it with a friend  it was just the right amount of food! the waiters and waitresses are very nice and attentive  i have also heard their fried chicken and happy hour are really good as well! will definitely try next time  )
came here for a friend's bday  had a rsvp for a table but the table was so small  we all felt cramped  kind of unhappy abt that cos if they kno they cant fit that many ppl on one table they shoulda told us and we woulda picked another place  anyways  food was on mediocre  i tried the spicy sticky ricecake  spicy fried chicken  scallion pancake and steak  the spicy sticky ricecake dish was overpowered by sauce  it was served w some ramen  steak was cut into medium pcs  but utensils given were only spread knife spoon and chopsticks  their flavored sojus were better  tried the mango and yogurt flavor  it seemed like they were tryna turn the spot into a party after  we were kind of rushed by the waitress cos they were startin to set up this place just didnt make much of an impression for me 
hubs and i ventured out for sunday dinner and decided to try this new place in flushing  the decor and atmosphere is great  very innovative  especially for flushing  it looks like something you would find in tribeca  the service is great  which is the norm for a korean establishment  i wish all restaurants had the korean gold standard for service  makes the experience 1000x more enjoyable  they also have a fully stocked bar with a knowledgeable bartender and several tvs so it would be a good spot for late night drinks we ordered a pitcher of cucumber soju  spicy chicken wings  kalbi and stir fried octopus with pork  no lie  everything was delicious  the chicken wings and octopus pork were spicy but that just meant deliciousness in my mouth  it's spicy but with lots of flavor  not just blinding heat  my husband  on the other hand  was gulping down the cucumber soju  so order spicy if you can handle spicy  i actually like their wings better than kyochon and mad for chicken  the kalbi dish came on a sizzling platter with onions  peppers  mushrooms  and mashed potatoes  this was prob our fave dish of the night because we were craving meat and this hit the spot  beware that this place is not dirt cheap  compared to the rest of flushing but you really do pay for what you get  it's a cool place with awesome service and good food  i would definitely come back and suggest this place to groups of friends that want to catch up with drinks and food 
im starting to think its really interesting that so many korean style chicken places are opening up  walking around flushing the other day i was handed a flyer for this place since they were having their grand opening and were trying to draw in people just walking on the street   it was actually kind of funny because after getting the flyer and walking away a lady came up running after me and my friend to hand us a sample of their chicken to try   me and my friend walking around actually went to a place nearby for some small plates and bubble tea before coming back so keep in mind we were already  80% full but i still wanted to take a look at this place since it seemed to market itself different than bonchon and kyochon  the menu is pretty interesting   they are going for that korean fusion style so mixing korean with american with mexican    i get when places open they like to have all of their staff there to have a good first night and get a idea of how things are going to run and who should stand where and all that good stuff but wow  ive never been so attended to in my life! i felt that every fifteen min  or maybe even less one of the rotating four people that came to our table kept asking if we needed anything else or how it was or what we thought   im not going to really complain about that since thats just a thing new restaurants need to face and realize that asking me every ten min isnt really going to change and if i really need something ill probably flag someone down for it  other than that everyone is super friendly  we had the pleasure of meeting the owners husband who was there to help oversee the opening of the restaurant for the night   he was really enthused about the opening and really takes pride in the food he has created so its great to see that passion in a new restaurant   what sets this place part from the other random chicken places is the way they make their chicken   they have the fried version which can come spicy or with the soy garlic   then they have a grilled version that they bring to your table almost as a whole organic chicken then they cut it up into good sized pieces for you to share with your friends or by yourself lol super tender and super moist yet still had that yummy crispy later on the top   because of the super nice owner we got to try full plates of both chickens and compare   honestly after having so many other variations on korean fried chicken i like the grilled better! not to mention its probably a littttle bit better for you  my small beefs with the place are as followed  the flyer they were handing out (on friday) advertises that they have 'happy hour 4 7'  only to be told because it was the weekend they dont have a happy hour at all   when you're handing out a flyer on the first day of your restaurant   dont you want all the information on the flyer to be relevant? the happy hour deal was actually the deciding factor for me and my friend to take a step in the first place  sigh  oh well misleading advertising   prices are up there with manhattan   soju runs $15 a bottle and beers run $5 9 mostly   the platter of grilled chicken was $18 small  $24 large   random apps from jun to tangs are all $20 $35 a plate    as we were getting ready to leave the waitress just took our not finished plate of both chickens and didnt even ask us if we wanted to take it with us   there was a sizeable amount left!! she just took it away   along with my last shot of soju i poured myself to drink before we left but she took that away too    a little rude    im sure that with time and experience this place will take off in flushing    their place is a little off the main drag but its a great place to come with either one friend or five   the atmosphere is open and modern   enough space between tables to not feel overcrowded and still enjoy your night  give it a try and pretend your back in seoul having a great chi meck night 
great sports bar feel with yummy chicken in a bunch of different ways 
the coop is really great wings and friendly staff  its located in the mall so very convenient  a great place to watch some basketball games
came with 3 other friends for dinner on a wednesday and there were plenty of seats   not that it was empty by any means we ordered a bulgogi quesadilla  parmesan truffle fries  and a large order of soy garlic wings (20 pieces)  we basically ordered what other yelpers seemed to recommended   and these yelpers know what they're talking about the bulgogi quesadilla was really simple but tasted great  the marinade spices that go into the bulgogi is definitely something different than i'm used to when it comes to bulgogi  there were 6 pieces in total so we each had one and split the other two pieces in half  we asked for a knife  but strangely they said they don't have any knives  the fries were so perfectly crispy  i love fries like these (think popeyes fries texture)  and it came with ketchup and a good spicy mayo that tasted a bit different from the usual kewpie sriracha combo i'm used to tasting  and lastly  the wings were great  not as crispy on the outside as i'm used to but the glaze was great  the soy garlic was a different flavor than the soy garlic flavor mad for chicken   debasaki   bonchon   etc usually carries  it's sweeter and has a little bit more of an asian fusion kick  i still thought they were good the food comes out faster than at mad for chicken   they take at least half an hour til their chicken comes out happy hour ended at 7 and they kindly reminded us 5 minutes beforehand if we wanted to order anything for cheap  the servers are attentive because all servers seem to attend to all tables rather than having one person in charge of a table it was interesting to see korean dramas projected onto the wall and sports playing by the bar  i'm not sure if other people enjoy it as much  they also play only kpop in the background (which i dig)  i want to try the other dishes that haven't been yelped about as much next time  it's in a super convenient location by the new hyatt hotel so i'll be back!
the food here is not that great compare to other korean fried chicken places (mad for chicken  debasaki  ufc) they have happy hour  but it's not a good deal at all (6 wings for $7)    regular is 12 wings for $14   so basically u get to order a smaller portion    the service was okay  but the food was not worth the price  we got   half soy garlic half spicy wings  taste not bad  just not crunchy like other places  bulgogi quesadilla with fries  average quesadilla  but the fries were good     seafood pancake  would not recommend  taste plain without sauce and it completely fell apart when i picked it up  spicy rice cake  just don't   
the food is great  this review gets 2 stars for the service  i always enjoyed coming to this bar since the days when han and minh worked here  this past thursday i visited again after the mets game and i have to say the new guy at the bar needs some training  the guy barely acknowledged my fiancé when we were trying to order and gave my friends beer in plastic cups  maybe he was having a bad day  and hopefully the service gets better  the other guy with the glasses brought my wings out (which are so good btw) and he was very attentive  now that guy gave us all service with a smile 
i love this place for the food and environment  most of the time we get friendly services  but when we came with a large group of friends and sit at the bar on wednesday night  the bartender gave us this attitude made us feel like we shouldn't order anything more cuz it's causing him trouble  that's why they r getting a 4 star
really good wings  good vibes  amazing waitstaff  this is probably the cool hangout place that everyone has been waiting for  i'm sure everyone has had their fill of pool tables and food courts in flushing! been there twice  and would come back again!
great happy hour deals of one dollar oysters  draft beer  wine and cocktails  we ordered the soy garlic and the spicy wings and they were just ok  definitely not as good as mad for chicken  the oysters were very fresh and good  the sweet potato fries were good as well good ambiance  service was decent  overall  a good place to come for some drinks and munch 
we were looking for a place to have a drink for my co workers birthday in the flushing area and came across the coop  we had some drinks  a couple of beers and a few appetizers  boy were we surprised!! excellent chicken wings  bulgogi quesadilla and sweet fries 
all i can say is wow! their chicken wings are cooked perfectly with the perfect amount of spiciness  the bulgogi quesadilla is also a must try and will keep you coming back for more   will definitely be back soon!
when i think of parmesan truffle fries  i think of thin  light and crispy  flavorful and aromatic fries that's why the parmesan truffle fries from here were a little disappointing  if you like crispy fries don't order these because most of them will be way too soggy  on the positive side the quantity was very large which is a huge plus!the spicy wings are very spicy  i usually like buffalo style wings and can eat a half dozen no problem but these have a spicier after kick  favorite things to order soy garlic wingsbulgogi slider with fries
the chicken was good  no need to order from bonchon anymore (especially with their new price hike)  cute place to dine  came in for lunch with a friend  also the soju   gooooooood  budae jigae was ok i didn't care for it but my friend really enjoyed it  sweet potato fries were really good too! i would come back  so glad it's close by 
the new fulton square is really opening up new trendy restaurants and cafés  fueling up my anticipation for the coop bar  the coop is suppose to be a trendy korean fried chicken joint with cocktails  while the place is trendy  i found the space a bit lacking  we were relocated due to a reservation that they haven't set aside earlier and their tables were a bit too small to accommodate our order  (there were more spacious tables at the bar area  which didn't make sense since you would only just drink in at the bar)   chicken wings (half & half)   the spicy was lacking in flavor and the soy garlic wasn't too sweet   haemool pajun   fresh seafood  maybe a bit too fresh since i bit into a shell  yikes   bulgogi gratin   best dish here! creamy and savory  a perfect mix 
it's just great to have such a place opening after midnight in flushing  it saved my stomach when i starve for chicken wing  i love their chicken wing  crispy perfectly fried and covered with sauce  i also recommended to try their bulgogi quesadilla which i think was nice the vibe there was good and casual  it's perfect to hang out with friends  they have full bar and tv as well  service was good but space to improve  for my own good  i don't like to drink others drinks else than water after midnight  so i was expected them to fill my glass after i finished but seems like they only focusing on the alcohol bottle rather than the tiny little cup  anyhow  great job for having it in flushing 
i came here for a friend's birthday and the first thing that i would say is that if you plan on driving  anticipate a struggle to find parking  as it is in a very populated part of flushing and it definitely can take a while before you find a spot  that being said  the place itself is very spacious and there is definitely a sports bar vibe  there are tables for dining  a bar  and a large screen projection of sports games in the middle of the restaurant  the waiter that served us was friendly (though he wasn't great at english  it was definitely functional)  they offer a variety of bar food with a bit of a korean spin on them (chicken  fries  oysters  bulgogi quesadilla  korean style pancakes etc ) they also offer a variety of alcoholic beverages (beer  soju  makguli  mixed drinks ) i tried the strawberry makguli and found it to be very good  though slightly too sweet for my taste  the food was all very good and i really have nothing bad to say about any of the stuff we tried and for the price  it was all reasonable if you're looking to go out and have a night out with friends and are in the area  i would definitely recommend trying this place 
i've been to it literally all the korean fried chicken spots in flushing and manhattan and this one takes the cake  why you ask? that happy hour includes oysters and drinks  the soju lychee was bomb and the oysters were great  the chicken is perfectly crispy with a hint of sweet and saltiness if you order the soy garlic  the hot wings aren't the kind that you will regret the following morning  the bulgogi quesadilla was on point and so was the parmesan fries   all in all  it was worth it  the only downside is that you have to argue with people who can't park in the public lot so my advice is to park it in the big lot and walk yourself over 
so trying to open the door a gentleman rushes to open it for us i was really pleased but he really didn't have to  then i go inside and there's no waiter in sight to seat us  we only see the bartender and of course we don't expect her to come out and seat us so we just walk around for a bit trying to decide if we should sit here or not   (i didn't wanna sit down and be ignored because they didn't know we were there or something) so finally someone sees us and i ask him for a table and he directs us to this awkward bench meant for two people  although it's cute to sit side by side with my boyfriend i prefer sitting across from him and the seat just made us both uncomfortable for the first couple of minutes  a few minutes later we're handed menus  we decided quickly and were trying to get the attention of someone to take our order  some time had passed and still we struggled to simply place an order  we ordered half crispy chicken and mozzarella sticks  both really good  i enjoyed the food here  asked for some hot sauce the waiter also gave us some spicy mayo which i thought was nice of him  the seats and service aren't the best but if you can overlook all that this place has good food 
truffle fries   love it and generous portion!sweet potato fries   tried it  it's okay  will pass on it next timebulgogi quesadilla   love it; add the sour cream on it!soy garlic chicken wings   it's alright; it seemed very typicalatmosphere   very modern  hip and a great place to hangout with friendspeach soju   strong!
came here for drinks and small bites and i loved their menu  if i could i would've ordered one of everything but settled for some korean fried chicken and seafood pancake  the fried chicken was just delicious  perfectly spicy for spicy food lovers and warning for those that can't handle spicy food  they have a drink with a popsicle which is pretty good  very sweet  definitely returning to try the rest of their menu!
i've been here three times  and the first two times would have been a solid four stars but after my third experience  i'm sorry coop  but i'm going to have to bump you down a star  perhaps it's the time that i went   since the first two times i went on a quiet afternoon  but third time decided to come on a saturday night where they had a fairly full house   but i was still seated right away which was nice unfortunately  they seated us right in front of a huge party where there was this lady who kept having to go in and out and while getting in and out of her seat she would always (accidentally) push part of our table  this wasn't as big of a deal to me as the annoying waiter who kept pestering us to order  i mean  i get it  you want us in and you want us out  but we're dining in and i haven't even had my menu for five minutes  the first time that i told you "no   we aren't ready yet  sorry" it does not mean come again two minutes later to ask again!! their reasoning was because if we ordered chicken  it would take approximately 20 minutes to 30 minutes to make  i didn't really mind waiting  it's not like they bring out the food altogether anyway   plus  i've never had a waiter come off as strongly as this one the other two times i was here  oh   and another thing to add about this experience  i came at 10pm   not 1am when they're about to close!the food is consistent to what i remember it being  the wings are fresh and seasoned well  although the spicy wings are kind of weird to me because they do have a tingling on your tongue but don't taste spicy  their soy wings are okay  i like mfc better  their truffle fries are okay  i like the chipotle sauce it comes with  the kimchi fried rice was a disappointment though  even though it's well presented and comes in a large portion   i found it difficult to finish however  on the sunnier side  they did promptly refill our water and were very (maybe too) attentive of us  hopefully  i will bump this review back up in my future visits!  )
chicken wings taste is particularly good  oysters are also very fresh  each passing will buy a chicken wings take away service is also very thoughtful  is waiting for too long  hope to be able to produce faster 
this is a fun bar   clean  nice decor  i think that the bartender could drink anyone under the table  i had the fried chicken  spicy and traditional   tasty but messy    i would return if in the neighborhood 
the food was delicious  love their pricing on oysters during happy hours  their chicken was pretty good nicely glazed in soy garlic and spicy  thinking about it again makes me want to go back again tomorrow  pretty hard to find another restaurant similar to this in center of flushing  highly recommend!
i came here probably around midnight one night and it was still pretty busy  the place reminds me of mad for chicken  but i like this place so much better because its a more accessible location and they have so many other things on the menu!i basically tried all the popular menu items that people have been raving about on yelp  get the bulgogi quesadilla!! (i still think about it all the time) their fries and gratin are good as well 
the wings are really good  (the spicy wings are hella spicy!) the whole chicken is ok  i'd choose the wings over these   they're drier than the wings  the gratin is pretty good but way too much cheese compared to the other ingredients imo  truffle fries and sweet potato fries are good tooooo
the chicken is amazing omg  crispy juicy it's truly amazing  must go again & order 20 wings instead hahaha
very good korean food  above average bulgogi and good 'chap che' noodle dish  chicken  imo   average  great ambiance  friendly young staff (versus the older formal wait staff at a lot of the korean restaurants that are much more expensive) if you're new to the flushing experience (such a wonderful slice of ny (skip chinatown in manhattan   too touristy  crowded and overpriced)  this hub of businesses (municipal parking across the street) is as authentic as it gets 
had a great lunch with my friends  we ordered a kimchi fried rice and it was pretty good  we also had truffle french fries which were 10 10! they were delicious  the chicken was also great  overall great and delicious 
good  delicious chicken wing~ but to expensive ~ still like it and will come again even though it is expensive  is worth~
worst staff service ever  the waiters are really rude  i asked if i could have ordered something without a ingredient and she said the impossible and we won't do it for you  she would roll her eyes every single time she would come near us and 10 minutes after we got our food she said are you done yet and when we obviously weren't she would sigh and give us so much attitude  the other waiters are nice expect her  my friends come here frequently and they always tell me how the waiter there is so rude and manerless  i would never come back to get food from this place again because i don't want to see her  she make me so mad 
my fave new place  every time we come i always feel completely satisfied with it all  bulgogi quesos  kimchi egg rolls  fried gizzards (with spicy sriracha dipping sauce) served only during happy hour  grilled gizzards  japchae  and lychee soju are my staples there  the happy is great too  so take advantage of the deal of discounted beers and delicious food options 
good food  trendy atmosphere  would recommend   chicken and truffle fries are the way to go 
came here mostly for the korean fried chicken  that was good  but the bugolgi and seafood pancake was ok  service was mediocre (usually nothing special in flushing)  but the decor is nice  we were told that they no longer accept the yelp checkin offer for a free drink  they should take it down 
went with 6 other friends  i called to make a reservation the night before and nobody picked up  i thought that was actually a bad sign because that could mean they are missing some business  but i was determined to try the place so i called them the next day again and someone took the reservation  i specifically told them there is a 3 year old so they prepared a high chair before we got there  we ordered the wings  of course  the bulgogi quesdailla  gratin  truffle fries (to die for)  jap chae and a few other dishes  very reasonably priced unlike many korean places  nice decor and vibe but i am worried for them because we were there on saturday night from 6 30 9pm and it was only max 80% full at any given point of the night  i know it's new and the door on 39 ave is easily missed    maybe it will pick up some business as more stores restaurants open around 
i always enjoy the experience when i've come to eat here  the service was always very attentive and i never felt rushed even with a larger party during their busiest times  the food has consistently been tasty and the drink selection is pretty wide  i adore their happy hours with $1 oysters  my favorite dish i've had here thus far would probably be the seafood stew  it comes in a large shallow pot to your table which is meant to be shared with friends  i also loved their drinking munchies e g  dukbokki and chicken wings  they really hit spot  overall good food and a good times at this place 
i came here because i saw the review was pretty good n it was for a co worker birthday   we ordered the happy hour oyster 2 dozens which came after all of our food came   we ask the waiter again n again what happen to the oyster?  we ordered the seafood pancake (which have literally no seafood in it   it was like a vegetable or is a onion pancake)  a whole chicken   is sooo burned on the outside but is very juicy inside??  the chicken salad   just a normal shred chicken ranch salad   nothing special   we ordered 2  half half(spicy n soy garlic)   chicken wings  that soy garlic taste soooo weird   the skin not crispy n the sauce taste so weird is hard to explain   we had a galbi dish  octupus w pumpkin pure?? (thats what it said in the menu!  overally the food is nothing special that you want to come again   since we have lots of ppl they did gave us a grapefruit soju for free   since i think the restaurant was still new so they do not have enough staff yet   no one really came to ask if we need anything   we have to chase any waiters walking by to get something (another cup   napkins   my coke w lemon that have no lemon in it   forks   or order more food)  but they r nice to u when u ask them more than once   but the waitress that was serving us talks like we r annoying her so is not that pleasant! if u need to survive in flushing   u need to have better seevice n the food should be more special 
by far the best korean fried chicken place  spicy is really spicy  gizzard is a must get  nice selection of soju  it's a nice hang out place for either hh or weekend  i think they still have the $1 oysters from 3 to 6pm  and their lunch special are back 
fried chicken is great n juicy!!!!price at regular hours is not cheap but like the ppl and atmosphere there  ps have a big screen for kpop mv!!!!
i tried the chicken wings and fries rices   it was very tasty and unforgettable  i still have the flavor in my mind   specially the fried rice is totally different  from typical korean restaurants   i can't describe it but trust me you won't regret!
this place was suggested to me by a friend before i came  i decided to do some research on this place and found out it was a chicken place  i am not particularly fond of chicken so i was happy to find out that this place offer more than just chicken  i came in around 2 30 pm on sunday and it surprisingly it wasn't crowded  i ordered the bulgogi quesadilla which was pretty bomb! it came with 6 pieces which filled me up! the service was also on point  the waiters were attentive and made sure to meet all of our needs  the meal was delicious and fulfilling and i want to come back to try their pilaf 
came on a friday night and the service is great  sat at the bar ordered some wings and fries which were good  also tried the new spam fries and they were good  service by the bartender was excellent  atmosphere is good not to loud and not to quite  i will come again 
the food here was absolutely delicious! my boyfriend and i ordered a bulgogi quesadilla "it was incredible"  kimchi fried rice  2 orders of wings and some beers  everything that we ordered came out tasting sooo good! there was a slight spicy kick to the dishes but we enjoy spicy food  the atmosphere of the restaurant was really nice and chilled  the service was amazing  great staff  great music  great everything! lol i would definitely be returning here  d
i love it here! i eat out everyday  i'm a very big foodie  big foodie  my friend took me here for a birthday dinner and let me tell you  it exceeded my expectations and i was very pleased with everything from customer service to the food quality and presentation  even the wine was perfect  the venue is beautiful  i will be going back!
was hungry late night and grabbed some takeout  after surviving a 30 min ride home these wings were the delish! the half and half is the way to go  spicy and soy garlic they were still crispy  meaty and great flavored  the sweet potato fries didn't survive as well they were a little soggy probably from the steamy bag  worth a trip  looked cute and trendy inside too!
i've been here a couple of times and i really enjoy their food! i've tried the bulgogi quesadilla  their soy garlic the coop wings  gratin  bibimbap (which they had a one point)  their $1 oysters at happy hour and my friend had their kimchi fried rice  the bulgogi quesadilla was really good  it's a very different combination but worked!! their wings were pretty good as well and i really like the savory taste of the soy garlic sauce but the wings were kind of small  the bibimbap was really good and was a generous portion  the gratin was the one thing that didn't amaze me  the cheese was chunky and didn't really melt into the rice like i expected it to  the dish was really heavy but it might have just been me since i've cut back on cheesy foods lately  the oysters were great  as always  can't go wrong with oysters! my friend loves their kimchi fried rice  it's cooked perfectly and has a great balance of ingredients  although the coop is on the pricier side compared to a lot of places in flushing it's definitely worth it  their waiters are super nice and attentive which is a breath of fresh air since a lot of restaurants in flushing don't have their kind of service  i would definitely keep coming back and recommend to my friends!
the first time i've been here was around their grand opening and i've been back a couple of times since    its been consistent each time  the usual are truffle fries and half half flavored wings obvi  it's standard  and if i had to compare to all the other korean fried chicken spots around the city and queens (mfc  ufc  boka  bonchon etc) it's definitely top 3 if you're looking to have more than the basics then the bulgogi quesadilla is a musttt  ooo wow i'm salivating just thinking about it  the bulgogi is super flavorful and the quesadilla just as cheesy as you'd ever wish for some other dishes i've tried were the gratin  budae jjigae  and kimchi pasta    all very flavorful with no shortage of cheese as for decor ambience  this place looks like something you'd find in the city  young urban music playing  cool decor  spacious with wooden table and seats  has a full bar  the drinks are on point  pretty strong  but for the fruity weak drinker like me there were several tasty options  i've had the watermelon margarita in the summer and more recently this drink with a melon popsicle in it   delicious! great for groups  pricey but worth it p s  the spicy is pretty spicy  and i eat spicy 
i went here w my boyfriend a few weeks ago   i was more impressed w the entrees than wings  although they had good flavor and texture    we ordered dukbokki and some red meat dish  can't remember the name  and yuzu soju   the only thing i may have changed about the dukbokki was maybe to add more ramen (since i'm addicted to noodles)   i may not be a fan of soju  but it was very sweet tasting  almost as if it were lemonade  (but that's the flavor of yuzu)   ***a pitcher serves 4  not 2   ***i would come back here to try their hot pot though service is very attentive 
the coop is very close to main street  which is a huge plus since most korean fried chicken places tend to be located on northern blvd or a bit further down from main street  i came here last night with two other friends for dinner  upon entering  i noticed that it was a decently spaced area with a couple of tables that seat larger crowds  but with more tables that seated up to a max of probably 5 people  the ambiance feels more upscale  especially because it's different from other surrounding restaurants in flushing  each table came with a candle so i thought that was a nice touch  the place was dimly lit which i think is perfect for date night my friends and i ordered the truffle parmesan fries  budae jigae  and the small order of wings (12 pcs; half & half for flavoring)  the truffle parmesan fries were really crispy and it came with ketchup & sriracha mayo as its dipping sauces  i really enjoyed the fries and i'm usually not a huge fan of any truffle fries because i feel like the truffle taste overpowers everything else  however  the coop did their fries right and even though i did taste the truffle  it wasn't so strong which i highly enjoyed  the budae jigae was standard  i feel like it could've been a bit bigger considering it was $29 but i had no complaints on that  taste wise  the wings came in 12 pcs  with half of it being soy garlic  and the other half being spicy  even though the wings were crispy  i didn't think they were anything special  the soy garlic didn't stand out much to me  i tasted more of the soy and hardly tasted anything garlicky  the spicy wings were just plain spicy  i didn't like that at all  overall  the coop wasn't anything special to me  the fries were the only thing that stood out to me and i was disappointed in the wings  our waiter was nice but other than that  i thought this place was just average  i enjoy debasaki way more and their wings are better in my opinion since they have more options  i probably wouldn't mind coming back to this place if my friends wanted to but i wouldn't come here if i were craving some good korean fried chicken 
it's just great place  i really liked it something different for me  good food     good service  specially hyunjeong   she helped us in a  very good way to choose a food   i will definitely come back 
visited the restaurant for happy hour with my friends to celebrate our birthday  we ordered a dozen of the $1 oysters  truffle fries  4 orders of the $6 soy garlic and spicy chicken wings  and a pitch of the lychee soju  the waiters were extremely nice and attentive  we even got free birthday shots on the house! i'd have to say that i like the flavor of the wings here more than mad for chicken and the lychee soju was just as flavorful as i wanted it to be  definitely coming back for more!
the fried chicken is not as good as mad for chicken but the other things are pretty good  the cheesy fried rice is really good  i like the complimentary white kimchi too  there aren't a lot of korean fried chicken places in downtown flushing compared to northern boulevard so i think this one is a safe bet 
the food was underwhelming  sorryyyy!i like the place and service was good but if you are in flushing  you might as well go to northern blvd and really satiate your kfood appetite  i thought mad for chicken is a lot better i had the half and half chicken wings  the side radish was excellent but they need to up their corn game also had the noodle soup with spam etc  i enjoyed it 
only thing that kills me is that they close so early  at 2 00am? why?!i had a chocolate martini here  it was amazing  if you want something exotic and new then try the minky way  was delicious and not strong at all (if that's what you look for)  they also have some good craft beers on tap  bartender that attended me was great  could not complain about a single thing 
very unique korean soju place at the center of flushing  love their yogurt soju and wings  a nice spot for drink night will be back next time  ++ services 
i found alien legs crawling from a blue point oyster  the sever said just crab  and gave me a new one  but  i can't  i can't  i can't pretend i never seem this and accidentally swallow it and it will crawl inside my stomach! i lost appetite after seeing the dancing leg or tail  i probably don't want to see oyster for awhile  (
i only go to korean places for their fried chicken  they have decent fried chicken  but i still think there are other locations that does it better  alcohol wise they are pretty well stocked  p s  the perk about this place is that its at the heart of flushing  you don't have to travel far form the train station to get here!
if you're an avid k pop fan who enjoys listening to kpop then this place is for you  they play the most recent kpop songs as well as the most recent kpop music videos on the wall from a projector  though sometimes those music videos can be rated pg13+ i come here for the pitcher of flavored soju and whenever i feel like catching a drink with my friends  roughly $25 for pitcher of flavored soju which is pricy  but if you're a lightweight like me then this is enough for you and another lightweight friend to get buzzed  they also serve popcorn while you drink  their fried chicken is pretty good along with their kimchi pasta and bulgogi quesadilla  but the prices are pretty steep service is a hit or miss depending on who you get  but my cup of water is always filled until it gets super busy inside  besides that  the servers are usually very nice and friendly  i had a drink with my friend and she knocked out on the table and while i was waiting for her to sober up  the waiter constantly came to refill our waters and ask if everything was okay  on my way out i didnt realized i left my earphones behind and the same waiter kindly ran after me to return it which i thought was very nice of him  i would definitely come back again for the vibe only if my wallet is fat enough for it 
happy hour oysters $1 each  decent size  though the korean chicken wings are average and the noodles as well 
food  we ordered a couple of dishes to share  the parmesan truffle fries were surprisingly delicious  we ordered a large platter of wings which were crispy and well seasoned  we also had seafood pancake  pork belly  chicken gizzard and galbi  service  our waitress was helpful and attentive decor  tasteful and modern 
good food  but too loud sometimes  i wish it would be easier to converse with my friends while eating great korean fried chicken   reviewer 1food is very tasty  i recommend the soy garlic chicken and the pork belly  the atmosphere is very modern and unique  great lighting  food tastes fresh and authentic  reviewer 2
i came on a friday night and it was pretty packed  we ordered a soondobu  chicken wings  seafood pancake  pork belly  truffle fries and the bulgogi quesadilla for our group of 5  the bulgogi quesadilla was pretty good  the soondobu and wings were pretty spicy  for someone who loves spicy  it was kind of hard to enjoy the wings  we got a lychee soju too and it was pretty strong but good   it's a bit more expensive compared to other places  so i'm not sure if i would come just for a dinner  but it seems like a cool place to hang out on the weekend and get drinks and bites 
the staff are very polite and courteous  they have a great selection on beers and variety of cocktail choices  the decor is modern but yet trendy  love the chalkboard wall near the bathrooms  the wings are spot on delicious and meatier  overall  it's a great place to eat and chill 
the coop set the tone at one fulton square since day one  it could be argued that it is one of the best consistent food places at this new flushing food hub  it is rare to find a bar that can accommodate large groups and serve a decent dinner as well  not going too in depth on the food  i recommend the truffle parmesan fries  bossam  japchae  and any form of their chickens whether wings or whole  dukboki was slightly bland regardless of the spice level and the seafood pancake a bit burnt  service was awesome as we got our water pitchers refilled faster than we can drink  also they were always around to take a new order  the kitchen staff is not that efficient in handling a lot of orders so we had a long wait for each dish  the staff gave us a grilled chicken on the house for the inconvenience  free food is the best way to say sorryi can see why this place is constantly praised  can't wait to try the rest of the menu 
this isn't a sports bar  please don't come here expecting to have a great sports watching experience  that's what my friend and i did  and we knew we had made a terrible mistake the second we walked in to watch the mets clinch a world series berth  the coop is one of the many new establishments that have popped up on prince street with the new hyatt hotel  it's very modern and very clean (give it six more months; after all  it is flushing)  and is a very nice change of pace from the usual loud and dirty main area of flushing  the restaurant is really nice  wood furnishings  a respectable bar and many tables for couples and groups  my friend and i sat at the bar to watch the game on the two tvs  and were served by yoonmi  a bartender i have a very large crush on  and service was excellent  the beers were cold  and the conversation was light and entertaining  we ordered small orders of the soy garlic wings  and ummm   well  you won't be full  presentation was pleasing  but the wings were small to the point that i can only describe them as "cute "the fries  both the regular and the sweet potato  were hot and freshly fried  and the assortment of condiments was very appreciated  the chicken gizzards weren't worth the $7  they were tasty and all  but it was literally pieces of gizzard with huge slices of garlic  also  i love using whole black peppercorns when i cook at home  but it's not an ingredient you should be so liberal with  especially when used in a small portion of something  the ratio of whole peppercorns to gizzards had to have been 2 1  not great  guys  so why the note about this not being a sports bar? it's not  two tvs and a nice quality projector  but everything is on mute in order for the nonstop big bang and friends that was progressively getting louder and louder  my friend loved the fact that taeyang and g dragon accompanied the baseball game  but i just want to make sure you guys know that this is first and foremost  a restaurant  i really like the place though  oh and happy hour ends at 6  so if you're commuting from anywhere that isn't flushing  good luck  i'll definitely be back 
this place is amazing! i went here for a girls night with some of my closest friends and the service was on point  our waitress was very attentive  but not in the annoying way  we got oysters  truffle fries and the soy and spicy wings which tasted so good  they were cooked to perfection  we also got mango and strawberry mojitos which we also perfection  i love this place and i can't wait to go back 
the coop is conveniently located next to our hotel so we just had to try it   it's a fusion korean restaurant with a full bar offering  we ordered the garlic soy wings and pork and beef sliders  the wings were nothing exceptional   pretty standard to the bon chons and kyochons that we've frequented in the past   the sliders were very good   the pork slider being the favorite of our group   the space is contemporary and there is plenty of seating  the service was good and decent  but not overly friendly though   hence the 3 stars 
came here many times for dinner and happy hour  this place is awesome   the fried kidney is only sold during happy hour and is the best snack i've ever eaten   it goes so well with booze   the bulgogi quesadilla  korean fried chicken and stir fried kidneys are my go tos   i think the menu is pretty good  just haven't had a chance to try everything warning   the lychee soju is fantastic   my friends and i got a few pitchers and didn't feel it until we were leaving  )
okay  i love the coop  i can always depend on this place for amazing drinks and just a great time  to start off  the food falls into the category of "drunk good"  which means that okay  maybe that chicken is not the best chicken you've ever had or maybe the truffle fries don't really taste that truffley  but if you keep drinking whatever you feel is lacking will compensate itself i like the vibe  decor  and especially the service here  the servers here are very cool and know how to talk to customers sensibly and suavely (an easy but yet difficult task for many)  regarding the food  here's a list of things to order 1  wings (if you're in the mood for crispy korean style wings to go along with that beer)2  truffle fries (if you desire to eat crispy fries with the hint of truffle and don't want the overly strong truffle taste [but why])3  kimchi pasta (order if you're a sucker for asian italian fusion like me  i like this dish )4  pork rib fondue (order  very good ) spare yourself from ordering traditional dishes like galbi or ddukbokki here  because you know it's not a traditional place  unless you're really craving it drinks to order 1  lychee soju (if you have $ to spend and too lazy to make it  they present it nicely in a mound of ice and make it very strong )2  cheesecake shots (not sure if they're on the menu  yummy)3  lychee martini don't come here and not drink  you may not have a good time 
i came for dinner and i may be back  an initial issue is there is no tea  any kind of asian restaurant even if fusion should have tea a small order of the wings  half and half  was good and worth a return visit as are the truffle parmesan fries  the seafood stew was flavorful but the seafood overcooked and chewy the worst was the kalbi  it was burnt  overcooked  and chewy  the mashed potatoes were obviously out of a box  this was recommended by the waitress  either she doesn't know the menu or this was to pad the bill as this dish was $25 service is very attentive  if only the food was better 
i really expected a lot more from this place when i first heard it was opening  the first time i came  my friends and i ordered the fried chicken and i was pretty disappointed  it's definitely not as flavorful as other places i've tried and the spiciness level was too much in my opinion  the restaurant was pretty empty since we came during off peak hours  but our waiter still managed to forget our fries so i ended up not even being able to try them because by the time he remembered  we were almost done with our meal  i came back a second time to see if their other dishes might be better because i really liked the ambiance of the restaurant itself so its a nice place to hang out and chat with your friends too but everything we ordered the second time around still didn't really meet my expectations  the budae jjigae was mediocre  i'd rather stick with mad for chicken from now on  that's where the real good stuff is at 
one of the first korean fried chicken places where their spicy wings actually tasted better than the garlic and soy sauce wings  it wasn't too spicy like other places and had a nice flavor  their bulgogi quesadillas were also very tasty and definitely worth and try  the seafood pancake was okay  the difference with this pancake is that it seems very abundant of seafood but very little batter  the kimchi egg rolls were nothing special  the budae jiggae wasn't any different either  i think the best thing was the last love yuzu makgeolli  it was mixed very well 
came here for lunch  i love their chicken wings and this is a nice spot to chill  the service is good 
live in jersey and will come all the way here for this place! great food and atmosphere! must try their wings! staff is super attentive and friendly  ) if you're in the area or not this place is a must try!
the staff here seems to be dead inside  no smiles  no welcoming hello  except for this one cheerful girl who seemed to have the energy of a thousand suns  the chicken is ok  got the wings a few times and they never seem to taste fresh  they are a bit dry  the whole chicken got the korean flavored one which was pretty damn good but as i sit here eating my chicken i only count one leg one thigh  no wings and bunch of breast pieces   never seen a whole chicken with no wings and only one leg   a few of the other items on the menu don't stand out like crazy  over priced  consider one of the other locations in flushing if you don't mind cramped spaces and a little dirt and grime 
highly recommended for this restaurant if you love korean food like me ! tasty soup & soy garlic chicken wings !
utterly underwhelming  the decor and service were great  but i came to eattt the only plus i could think of is the spicy wings  they're hot but you can taste the flavor  it's not like other korean places where they're just blindingly spicy and you're scrambling to find water would not recommend the budae jjigae  for $29 you get very little  the "bowl" that it came in was flat enough to use as a regular plate  i'd understand if it was some quality jigae  but it wasn't i'd recommend mfc on northern  much better food  you get your money's worth  and you don't have to deal with the madness that is flushing parking if you must check it out  park at skyview center  it's free parking for the first 3 hours  buy some floss at target if you feel like you're gaming the system 
only have been here for drinks with a few friends at the bar customer service was very nice  bartender hostess was very attentive  not sure what to rate about food & drinks tho    since i ordered a bottle of soju & my friend a draft beer loldef love the ambience  music  and the interior will go back to experience cocktails & food next time!
very bad service  when we come in no nobody said anything  not even a hello  we find ourselves a seat and then menu came  wait more than 15 minutes and still not coming  we only order 12 pieces chicken wings  the waitress finally come over with the chicken wings but not for us but the the table next us  then the next table realizes is not their and the waitress quickly give it to us without said anything  my friend was very hungry and she take a bite but i was going to ask for the manager to change  before i ask  the manger came up with another chicken wings and ask if we ordered two  we said no but we would like to change to a new one  he gave us a new one but later he went by and said we already ate one  i am so sad and said " you can take one back"  what the     totally angry  never come back 
service was great ! food average  but if you come for drinks and a bite i don't think you'll be lacking   basically perfect drinking food  decor is really nice compared to other spots in flushing !
awesome place to hangout with friends  they have the best spicy korean chicken wings  one of the waiter is super duper friendly(don't know his name)  and they even give out free popcorns  how awesome is that lol
i've been here several times  and had their wings  i've tried both their soy garlic and hot wings  very similar to bon chon wings and i have to say if you like bon chon then you will love their wings  very crispy   great taste  very clean  friendly bartenders (as i've only sat at the bar)don't get the bulgogi sliders   too much bread   little meat and overall not the best dish to order i have to say  the place is very generic in terms of what i would predict a korean chicken wing place to be but there is nothing wrong with that  i do come here when i am in flushing  craving wings and a draft beer  my rating is based on my expectation  friendliness and cleanliness 
came here with a few friends for dinner one day in the summer and we were greeted seated rather quickly  we ordered the kimchi fried rice  parmesan truffle fries  large order of the soy garlic wings  & spicy seafood pancake  each order we received food was warm and delicious and eaten quickly  the chicken itself was 7 10  pretty good but not the best korean fried chicken  the ambiance was like a modern gastropub and you can tell majority of the crowd was in their 20s  the drinks here were pretty top notch and they offer a grand variety of top shelf liquor  surprising for a restaurant will be back if i'm ever in the flushing main st area 
food is pretty average  the chicken wings arent anything special just another version of mad for chicken  its decent if you're in the flushing area and dont want to travel out to northern  the truffle fries are always on point  they are the only thing i really love when i come here  i've also had the kimchi fried rice which is good but not amazing as well as their soups stews  the clam soup with onions and peppers were pretty bland  usually its peppery and spicy and salty but this one was just    disappointing  i would only come here because its convenient and its open late
we were greeted warmly  but the service was bad  the food was alright  nothing amazing  the waiter did not collect everyone's dishes and was kind of rude  the place looks nice and food was okay  but service  is bad 
definitely come here for happy hour oysters and cocktails! truffle fries are really good too and the portions are large  servers are extremely attentive as well  only downside imo is their wings are alright   overpriced and flavor wise debasaki does it better
the food is good! and the wait staff is very honest and nice  the atmosphere is very comfortable  the location is also very convenient 
this place is simply spectacular!i've gotten their fried chicken for take out before  but i never sat down and ate there until about a month ago  my friends and i have named this as one of our favorite restaurants in flushing  their fried chicken is delicious  their oysters are heavenly  and their drinks are perfect  i think it's best to come here with friends because the atmosphere is lively and hip!
the coop is a relatively new joint but it has easily become one of my favorite restaurants in flushing  i've been here several times since their grand opening so i've tried a decent amount of dishes from their menu  food  they have $1 oysters during happy hour (mon fri 4 7pm)! i don't know any other places in flushing that offer this wonderful deal  i've been to a lot of places in the city for happy hour oysters but their oysters are by far the freshest i've ever had  if you don't make it in time for their happy hour they still offer oysters on their regular menu (just not for $1)  i've tried their truffle parmesan fries (to die for)  sweet potato fries (perfectly crisp on the outside  soft sweet on the inside)  mozzarella fondue (ooey gooey goodness)  bulgogi spicy pork belly sliders (both delicious)  bulgogi quesadilla (i can eat this everyday)  kimchi pasta (the pasta was perfectly al dente)  seafood pancake (perfectly crisp on the outside  loaded with seafood on the inside)  bulgogi gratin (if you love cheese on everything then this is for you)  pork rib fondue (slow cooked to perfection)  jjusam (perfect amount of spiciness)  nurungji tang (delicious refreshing broth)  budaejigae (delicious spicy stew that goes well with white rice)  beef intestine soup (definitely not for everyone but it was really good!)drinks  their bevs are just as good as their food! my favorite drink from their happy hour menu is "all for you" (i think that's what it's called)  it's a tasty drink that's perfect for someone who doesn't drink as often  for someone who prefers something stronger  i recommend their mojitos    perfect amount of alcohol and sweetness! their cocktail soju's are delicious as well! if you're more of a water person    i have good news    their water is filtered and lemon flavored! service  i'm very pleased with their service  the workers are really attentive and friendly  everyone greets you when you enter the restaurant which is nice  ambiance  the atmosphere is wonderful as well as the decor  it's upscale  modern  and hip  it doesn't feel like you're in flushing  the bar is a wonderful spacious area to chill at  they have two tv's angled above the bar and a projector that plays kpop music videos  this place is a fun place to be at which explains why it's always busy at night on weekends! overall  the coop is the place to go to if you want delectable high quality food  it definitely beats out other korean fried chicken competitors like mad for chicken  bonchon  kyochon  etc imo  swing by and visit this place when you get the chance    i highly recommend!
went there for lunch with a friend to catch up  we order some chicken wings which was awesome  the fries was nicey fried and crispy  we then order some sliders with was great  but not enough to fill us up  good selections of alcohol too  must try  cool looking decor too  seems like a cool spot for some night life as well 
came during happy hour  oysters were fresh  soy garlic wings were bit too salty for me but enjoyable and spicy were the fit for me   i also got the japchae and bossam (pork slices with sides of white kimchi cabbage and spicy chives)  i enjoyed the japchae (great flavor) more than bossam (park was alright)  flavor of chives was too intense  cute waitresses tho for all you interested parties out there  service was attentive as well  i liked the atmosphere and it's a good place to nom away from the heat  would come back to try other food 
delicious food! i can't wait to go back  we ordered the spicy rice cakes spiciest i've ever had but absolutely delicious  the soy garlic wings perfectly crispy and flavoured  oysters so fresh  bulgogi quesadilla so much flavor in the bulgogi  delicious  i enjoyed everything i ate  the staff was very friendly but didn't come to us that often so we had to keep getting their attention 
good service  good drinks and nice apps but note to self   the deepfried chicken gizzards are only offered during happy hour and at no other time   that was such a letdown as they are such a good thing  to eat with the great soju coctails they offer 
love the wings and the big servings of dishes!get a free drink if you check in on yelp! it's really a great deal!!!!
one of the better bar places in flushing  their selections of drinks is pretty diverse  came here after work for a quick get together with coworkers  food was decent  the wings are better than regular wings in the flushing area  other than that  nothing really special  we ordered 3 bottles of wine and they gave us a rice wine on the house (which i thought was pretty cool ) service was good  waitress and waiters always made sure we had enough food on our table one perk  tvs to watch the games!overall  good place for a get together but i would not recommend coming here for dinner  this place is more of an after dinner  get a few drinks  talk or watch the game kind of bar restaurant 
their wings made me flyyyy  reallly  they're so crispy and the flavors are on point  it's made to perfection  even their spicy wings are amazing their spicy hot pot is quite good  though not the best i've had  but definitely come here for the wings 
i really enjoyed the atmosphere of this place and the food was great! i arrived with a party of 6 around 5 00pm on a sunday and there was no wait  i really liked where the restaurant was located  it was kind of like a food mall  i guess  the coop is on the 2nd floor  the place has a pretty nice bar area and there was a good amount of seating  we were seated in a table near the window and i loved how the afternoon sun came through the window our server acknowledged us right away and came by and took our order in a timely manner  my party ordered a dozen blue point oysters  truffle parmesan fries  sweet potato fries  kimchi fried rice  spicy pork belly  and of course  the coop wings  unfortunately  we had to order only soy garlic wings since the people in our group who couldn't handle spice outweighed the people who lived on spice  everything was quite enjoyable  however  the radish that they gave us with our wings didn't taste very good  you must try the sweet potato fries! they are bomb  i found myself reaching for those more than the truffle fries  the honey blue cheese sauce that it came with was so delicious! the oysters were average  nothing special  their kimchi fried rice was definitely very spicy  we couldn't even finish it  i was also interested in trying some of their fusion stuff like the bulgogi sliders and quesadillas  so i will definitely return!
my first experience here was great  food delicious  you pay for what you get  and that is quality food  my order included bulgogi quesadilla   truffle fries   and of course chicken  the soy garlic chicken i can say is better than other places you might find  as for the truffle fries they were fantastic! the bulgogi quesadilla was on point as for service here  it was pretty good the workers greeted us when we arrived as well as leaving  they were pretty attentive and had a good idea when customers needed help this is the place to go to if you want some korean chicken!
i love the spicy chicken wings the bibimbab was soso coz they put too much green salad ( not like real korean bibimbab ) the seafood jigae not my fave the beef quesadillas quite good the service too slow just bcoz of only one server was working in that time but overall nice to try
honestly  is this place a resturant or a bar? other than the first cup of water brought to your table after you sit down  the refills arrive probably the same time as your check  they recommend the drinks over their foods and when i order a chicken grilled   not only did they forget to inform me that it will take time  after asking about my order for the 3rd time  the server told me he did not put in the order and there would be another 45min wait  i was lucky that i had order the steak quesadilla to eat first otherwise i would not have gotten a meal that night lastly   all i got from the waiter was a quick "sorry" as he handed my check and they expected me to tip 15%  not a place i would go back to again unless you are a group that knows the exact amount of what you eat and drink and requires no service after you've ordered 
their chicken wings are pretty good but the other food is standard  the interior is really nice but their bartender is not professional  i asked for a round of lemon drop shots and the server said the waiter didn't know what that was   pretty basic drink if you ask me  the crowd is very korean at night time but during lunch it's very slow 
tried the wings and the truffle parmesan fries and it was amazing  the wings can get pretty spicy the more you eat and they have some really cool deals for holidays lunar new years and valentine's day so that was also pretty awesome  the guy at the door was pretty cool too so i had a nice conversation with him while waiting for my friend  shout out to that guy 
i went there a few weeks after their grand opening  they have a happy hour menu from 4 7pm where you can get oysters for $1  their oysters were really fresh and it comes with a special sauce that goes well with it  their truffle fries came in large portion and it's pretty worth it for $10  however  they always give out their sauces in such small portion  i kept having to ask for more  their chicken wings were pretty good  it's actually very similar to bonchon or mad for chicken except there is more flavoring to it  it is definitely a go to place if you're craving for chicken and you're near by the area  i also had their seafood pancake but looks can be deceiving  the taste of it was decent but way overpriced at 19 bucks 
yes  there are many korean chicken places in queens but this place also has many other great twists to their dishes! a very americanized taste is added to korean food  it may freak ppl out but its fun to try  their bulgogi quesdailla is sooooo yummy with cheese oozing out!!!! & who doesnt like gooey cheese? haha  their soy garlic chicken wings are also good  id say this place is better than others in the flushing area plus side  this restaurant has a full bar!
just couple of things great selection of food and drinks  i just hope that the gratin smelled less like vinegar  it tasted good but a bit too much on the vinegar like smell  the wings were decent and the bulgogi quesadilla was the most memorable; i was actually impressed nice atmosphere  the lights were dim and the music sound was fair service was solid  fast and efficient  it was obvious that the servers really cared about my table  they were all polite but one thing  i just wish they'd smile more overall  it was a good experience  one of better places in flushing 
i was looking for a late night spot to eat after some christmas shopping  this place is nicely decorated  very clean and the staff is friendly  the truffle fries are on point and definitely a must! we also ordered a mushroom soup (without the beef strips) and it wasn't bad  it was something different to try  the drinks are also very interesting  we had the iced lychee drink which i really enjoyed  i definitely recommend this place to anyone that's in the flushing area 
i had to visit because i passed by and heard great reviews  my bf and i ordered the budae jigae  12 piece half and half coop wings  and truffle fries  so much food  but very tasty! the fries were bomb  soup was good  just wish they had bigger bowls  and wings were flavorful  the spicy weren't too spicy  so it was enjoyable  i wish they had wet naps though  my bf and i also ordered drinks  he had the summer special with the ice cream  very tasty  i had the princess drink with gin  it was  delicious! definitely will come back  sometimes service was slow  but it can be worked on 
everything from the food to interior to service is great  it's big enough for small gathering with friends  i highly recommend the bulgogi quesadilla   it comes with fries when you order out  i think the take out menu is different from the restaurant menu 
tastes as good as home (santa clara  ca)!  crispy  spicy (not too hot) fried chicken   also had a bowl of tasty kim chee fried rice   great decor   friendly service   good beer selection (and full bar)   was slow on weekday lunch  so we were seated immediately   a great find a very short walk from out hotel on a cold day 
absolutely love this place  great atmosphere  great food  and not too pricey! drinks are made well and the staff is super friendly  i go way out of my way to go here 
this place was a super cool atmosphere and the food was all delicious  we were two people and got the chicken wing mix (soy and spicy)  japchae  bulgogi sliders  and peach soju  the wings had great flavor  some of them lacked a bit of crunch  but still delicious  the japchae was really good! it was a first for me on that dish  and i was pleasantly surprised  it also came out really quickly  the sliders were good  but i wished there was a little more sauce  i would love to try the spicy pork ones next time  the soju was delicious and surprisingly strong  usually flavored soju's are tasty but weak  so very well done  they also gave us two shots on the house! they wanted us to try a new drink they've just added to the menu  i don't remember the name but it had fireball  rum chata  and milk  i had wanted to try it when i first saw it  so i was so excited they brought it over! i liked it  i don't think i could do more than one  but i enjoyed the flavor  overall i would absolutely come back  and i would recommend it  i love bar food  so i felt very at home 
the food is great! the bulgogi quesadilla and gratin were absolutely amazing!  the kimchi fried rice had great spice and really good flavor   the wings left a bit to be desired   we had split between the flavors 50 50 but i honestly couldn't tell the difference which makes me think our order was either wrong  or the flavors were just so similar that it didn't make a difference what kind you ordered the reason it gets 3 stars is that the service was awful   i was there on a sunday at about 3pm so needless to say the place was pretty empty still   we ordered apps and entrees and for some reason everything came out at once  except the wings   the waiter said those take longer (than everything else we ordered? think that's a lie) but they didn't come out until we were done eating everything else   the table next to us  who came in after us  got their order of wings first so i'm not sure what happened here  our waiter though seemed to disappear as we started to eat though leaving us without any service at all   it wasn't until i went to the restroom that i found him sitting in the back at a table with other servers just lounging   the poor bartender seemed to be the only one serving the entire restaurant and we felt bad as we watched her run around trying to do it all   it wasn't until we got our check from her that the other waiter showed up to collect   just really poor service   they're luck the food is so good 
we had a party of 10 and they accommodated us well  we had a few mix ups with our reservation time but fortunately it all worked out  (first they thought it was for 6 30 pm on friday  but it was for that time on saturday  they had the date correct  but day of the week incorrect  then they called on saturday to confirm the 8 30 pm reservation  not the 6 30 pm reservation i had made ) luckily  they didn't seem packed at that time  so they were able to fit us in  our table just barely fit 10 people  it was more appropriate for 8 we all enjoyed our food  however  and we ordered quite a variety  beers  cocktails  wings  fries (those orders are huge  you need fewer than you think)  sliders (this was the only meh in my book  the buns weren't very exciting)  quesadillas  jap chae  and grilled chicken service was friendly and good  i'd definitely go back!
never again will i be stepping foot in this place  i visited the place last night and ever since then  i have the worse sore throat and two diarrhea  ugh  biggest regret ever!
their foods are pretty good  mostly done in a good format  the reason i could not give them full stars was because they are very slow in speed and make the incorrect orders few times that i went to  shop owner should provide more training for staffs before throwing them right into the customers 
fun relaxing loud music korean bar the crispy chicken was delicious perfectly fried and tasty   the kimchee  seafood pancake was also good  and ramen korean spicy seafood soup yummy   rice wine ok lecher martinis were decent overall nice relaxing food and drink with friends
i am so glad this opened up in flushing because i didn't have a favorite go to korean place for a long time! i love how friendly the staff are here  i definitely will be returning here few times a month  this place has a lot of seating areas and they also play some of my favorite music too 
the wings are really good  especially the soy garlic wings! we ordered the kimchi fried rice and it was alright  the wait wasn't long  so i recommend it 
one of my new fave places  i've been going once every two weeks to get my chicken and budae jigsae fix  owner and staff care about the customers; very friendly and exceptional service  kind of want to keep this spot a secret  it's already getting packed all the time and it just opened  i don't cook  i eat 
brooklyn lager draft beer     wings (garlic soy flavor)oysters went for happy hour yum   $1 oysters was ok nothing special   chicken wings hit the spot  had the fried chicken gizzard appetizer     good portion w spicy mayo sauce     little too doughy     was ok check off the list  i would go back for more beers and taste more off their menu  place is modern with nice cool feel ambiance  
the atmosphere is nice  the place is pretty spacious and since it just opened it's nice and clean  the staff is accommodating and friendly  they have an awesome cocktail menu! i love that as a drinker  also their food is pretty yummy  nom nom nom  )
the food is ok  service is not that ok   if you call the waitress more than 3 times you'll see their attitude  plus taking the wrong orders  my bill was $175  i gave $45 tips and the waitress said it's not enough!  what????  so i took back $15 and called their manager  need to put more smiles on these waitress 
came for dinner nice hot wing，and nice place to eat in flushing  i will come back again 
wow! wow! wow! this place is a awesome! the service was attentive and the food    oh my    the food    was amazing  their "spin" on the sliders and fries is a must have  compliments to the chef! this place is still new so there was no wait for a table  but i'm sure when the word gets out    this place will be packed 
food was good  my favorite was the bulgogi quesadilla  place was clean and organized  bathroom was pretty clean as well  came in in a wednesday with a party of 6  took a little long to get the servers attention to ask for check but there were only 2 servers and 1 waterboy on the floor so thats understandable 
the best modern korean restaurant i've ever visited wings and seafood pancake are so delicious atmosphere is fresh 
i have been here once every week since the coop had its grand opening! this is honestly by far one of the best chicken places in all of queens  mind you  i've tried all of them    mad for chicken  debasaki  kyochon  bonchon chicken    the atmosphere and service is phenomenal  everytime i look up  a waitress is already on her way over to me to see what i want  (a bit creepy  but whatever) from the second i walk in they greet you with their korean greetings and make you feel welcomed  as for the atmosphere  it feels like a restaurant you would find in the city  it is classy  fun  and warm  the food is out of this world  i love getting the soy garlic chicken (i can't handle spicy)  parmesan fries  bulgogi quesadilla  mozzarella fondue  pilaf  gratin  pork rib fondue  sliders  and the seafood pancakes  like i said  i've been there every week since the grand opening so i tried many things! as for the price  you get what you pay for  for the atmosphere and the food and the amazing service  every cent is worth it  if i could  i would give this place a 10 out of 5 stars  cheers to the owner and workers for making this place awesome!!!!!!!
this is my favorite place to go in flushing everytime im craving chicken wings! the place is so nice compare to other places in flushing  i love korean food too so the coop is really good for me  i love their soy garlic chicken wings! the spicy wings are too spicy for me so i cant really enjoy it  i tried several more dishes too  like pancakes  bulgogi  and some more! i will definitely come back!
the food here is delicious  it's not traditional korean  and u don't get all the little side dishes  but the chicken is moist  and the sauce is unique  the sauce is barbecue  but something more  sweet and savory and not overwhelming 
this place is convenient if you want to grab some korean style fried chicken  once you get off the train it's not too long of a walk  by car you can park at the municipal parking lot  or go to skyview mall and get 3 hr free parking  they offer two flavors for their fried chicken  did the half and half  and the spicy ones were just too spicy for me  otherwise it's pretty good but i have tried another place which offered bigger drumsticks and wings  their truffle fries was well worth it; taste good and the portion is big  the budae jigae was rather small  the broth looked really red but flavor wise was pretty watered down 
took out of town friends here because they are steak and potato people  figured it was a safe bet (and it was)  the music was great  shazamed a bunch of asian artist  the chicken was amazing!!! i would definitely go back if i am every in flushing again!!
the service there was pretty good but the food there was amazing  it was very filling and came in large portions  me and my friends had only ordered four dishes but we had so much trouble finishing it especially the fries  they were definitely worth $10  we got the truffle parmesan fries and it was really good  nicely crisped and the spicy mayo sauce went so well with it  we also got the kimchi pasta  egg roll omelette and the bulgogi quesadilla  all of the dishes tasted great  i would love to come back again 
love it here  cute service  creative korean food and drinks!! many beer options as well! beautiful waiter and waitress  makes dining here even more enjoyable!
came here to try out how their chicken was since i heard good things about it  let me just say  this is probably my new favorite place when i'm craving some real korean fried chicken  i say this because i usually don't (or can't seem to) eat the whole chicken off the bone  but with their chicken  it comes off really clean  the flavors are also on point and are not too strong or too weak  aside from the chicken  the sweet potato fries are bomb and worth the $10 you pay for  the deco is also nice and cute  perfect for a group of friends or even a late night date  one less star because the service was not the best  my boyfriend and i got seated right away but they didn't give us water even after taking our order until we asked  the food took kind of long as well but the wait was worth it so i didn't mind  overall  i can't wait to try the rest of the menu!
this is such a great hangout place!  hands down one of the few places with superb customer service   if you feel like having some korean pub food with drinks  this is the place to go!
this is your regular korean fried chicken at a place conveniently located closer to the 7 train  i found their fried chicken to be heavy on the breading which made them difficult to eat after awhile and filling in a bad way  their grilled chicken is definitely the better option  juicy  great portion size and pairs well with the parmesan truffle fries which are a must try  they have happy hour which includes $1 oysters but they are not the best of quality so i would definitely pass on this as there are much better places for this in the city 
chicken wings taste good   typical prices   only bad things are that it's way too freaking loud and the service is slow 
the wings were as good as they were hyped up to be but the wings took way more than half hour the bulgogi slider quesadilla was creative but was pretty bland in taste oysters were awesome though service was great 
i haven't been to that part of flushing for few years  was very surprise to see this huge building where once used to be a parking lot  coop was an interesting place the food was pretty good and enjoyed the drinks there 
the best happy hour in town! the wait staff is always attentive and around to service  the chicken is bomb com  i love the corn they give you as a side  i can literally eat that as it's own fish  the quesadilla is not to be missed 
i love that they offer other food than fried chicken  when you order the fried chicken you're given small buckets for bones! very considerate! also highly recommend their truffle fries and bulgogi quesadilla!!! they also have a bar too 
if you don't want to go too off of main st  to eat korean fried chicken  this is your spot  i would normally have to travel further out to northern blvd  for chicken so i'm glad a closer place has opened  don't let the express take out stand in the front fool you  it is spacious and nicely decorated inside  the service here is great and the food is tasty! they have dollar oysters during happy hour as well as $3 beer and other drinks  it's a good get together spot with good vibes  stop by before this place gets too popular!
came here on a sunday night after a recommendation  the atmosphere is very trendy and there is plenty seating which is great! the staff is quite attentive and we were even offered shots because our food was a little delayed [barely any additional wait but it was nice of them to notice and offer  )] i got a small order of soy garlic chicken wings (comes with 14 wings   good deal) and parmesan truffle fries and both were awesome! my boyfriend seemed to enjoy my wings too because he ended up eating half of them on top of eating his own food (so greedy!   next time we'll be sure to order a large)  our drinks were great as well  i got the lychee martini and my bf got the apple martini   both super delish and pretty strong  we will def be back very soon 
made reservations for a group of 12 and they were super accommodating   service was very attentive and the ambience was great!  the lychee soju was really yummy as compared to the mango soju   ordered platters of spicy and regular chicken wings  dubokki  seafood pancake (average)   truffle fries and sweet potato fries (the all stars) 
so far i tried kalbi  kim chi fried rice i think  seafood pancake  and truffle fries   kalbi is the usual  fried rice is decent  seafood pancake is a heart attack   way too much oil   a pool of it   best thing in this place is truffle fries didn't try the drinks yet service is decent  food consistency   meh (but truffle fries yummm~)
chicken was good  atmosphere was pretty good too  was a little expensive but not too crazy  and overall its a nice place to go 
the food is overall good but way overpriced for wht it is ($18 for an order of chicken gizzards?)     the wings were good but not over the top better than the next korean chicken joint    the sliders were really good tho   big comfortable space and nice bar  music kinda louder thn necessary but not too bad   service was good typical 
soy garlic fried chicken nothing like bonchon      more like general tso's  if u r in the mood for loud environ  this place is great  lots of young college kids hanging out getting drunk  mad for chicken has far better food and environment 
their oysters are very fresh  we also had their fried chicken which is ok not a big fan of it  their quesadillas is quite tasty!! great service loud music & super cold ac!!
the restuarant bar is located in a busy area  there isn't much parking available  but there are train station and bus stops near by  the atmosphere is great  and the food is good  esp their french fries and duringji tang? food and drinks are on the pricey side  most korean restuarant are  the makguli mixes are super amazing! very refreshing and light  will def come here again soon 
good service  but i would not recommend their chicken wings  too much flour and too deep fired   
finally hv some korean bbq wings in flushing  love this plc  love the inside decoration   food is yummy   highly recommended  
great food  truffle fries are great and so is the chicken  food is quite pricey but worth the trip  they also have a nice bar and the scenery is good 
the environment is pretty nice & cute  ive been here 3 times already & i defiantly will come back more in the future! so far  i tried kimchi fried rice chicken wings sliders with pork belly  and fried rice with eggs & beef! (i forgot the names orders) kimchi fried rice  i would defiantly recommend! although it is spicy but tastes good! chicken wings  theyre pretty good! they have flavor but  it is a bit too spicy for me sliders with pork belly  the pork belly is really good & adding some vegetables to make it less spicy fried rice with eggs & beef  the egg mixed with the fried rice is super good! & the beef tastes well cooked!
expensive but great food! staff is awesome and has a nice atmosphere 
for a place that's supposed to be known for it's korean fried chicken  it did not live up to it's name  for the price  there are many more places that have better quality and larger portions  that being said  the bulgogi quesadilla was delicious  the truffle parmesan fries were delicious and definitely the highlight of the meal  the service and atmosphere was great  but overall  definitely better korean fried chicken spots in the area 
my wife had 2 friends coming from overseas and she wanted to eat at the coop  i've never been there for dinner  so i was hoping the service was a lot better than last time during lunch (take out)   got there at around 8 30pm  got seated right away and started looking at the menu   we order the 20 pcs chicken wings 1 2 spicy and 1 2 soy sauce garlic  japchae  kimchi fried rice  seafood jeon and nurungji tang   everything was very delicious and service was excellent   during the time the waiter was taking our order  he told us we were ordering too much food  so we didn't order the rice cake dish   everybody really enjoy all the dishes and all the waiters were giving us amazing service   the decor is really nice at the coop and there weren't many people eating there  since it's a monday night   highly recommended!
i loved the garlic chicken wings and sweet potato fries! the price is reasonable! i'll recommend the place to my friends
i find myself a little more critical with korean fried chicken spots because there are so many nowadays  although the coop is located in downtown flushing  parking is manageable with the muni lots and random street parking  the location is in a trendy spot among the newer hotels  i came here on the day before halloween and the decor was very festive! there is ample seating and my party of six was seated immediately  the service here is friendly and quick  we ordered the bulgogi quesadilla (conveniently cut into six for us)  truffle fries  and the soy garlic chicken wings  in terms of being unique  the bulgogi quesadilla wins and was awesome  i have no complaints about the fries or the wings but nothing special to say about them either  i was surprised by the lackluster appetizer spread  instead of seeing a variety of appetizers like kimchi  salad  etc   we had a tiny dish of pickled raddish for the six of us  not the end of the world  was just expecting more  all in all  i think its definitely worth trying the coop out; they offer a variety of other dishes in addition to their selection of chicken  great atmosphere  good service  average food 
best service and food! soy garlic wings  truffle fries and bibimbap were all delicious!!
place is bomb  everything on the menu top to bottom is great if not fantastic  wings are a must every time  they are out of items sometimes  but haven't been in a while so maybe they are getting better at this aspect  either way  my girl and i go every chance we get  blows other chicken korean establishments in flushing and even in the greater ny area out of the water  they really focus on service too which i like 
the food was delicious  especially the truffle parmesan fries! the chicken was also good  but could've been better  i liked the little dishes that came with the chicken   it added some nice flavor  the mozzarella sticks were great  and as was everything else we ordered  i highly recommend!
came here a few times  foods r just average  nothing really special or fancy  it just another typical korean restaurant in flushing  make sure u order wings or chicken first  they took forever to make them  even when it's not busy!!!!
this is a nice place to bring friends and sit around some food but the food itself is just ok   definitly not worth its price if you ask me  there are better korean chicken places around flushing the atmosphere is nice though  just not impressed with the food 
my favorite was the seafood spicy stew  amazing! they also usually give you shots on the house  i celebrated new years eve there  they had a karaoke contest and i won 3rd place! i had a splendid time at this spot  )
perfect service! very nice staff all d time ! love d taco here n yogurt soju is d best'
i would come here every day if i could  good atmosphere with great food and attentive staff  i've had my car each time so i haven't drank but people seem to enjoy the bar too
the decor is very nice and they have a beautiful bar   they have happy hour for drinks and $1 oysters   bulgogi quesadilla and chicken wings are my favorite  do not order spicy if u cant handle spicy  their spicy chicken wings are too spicy for me  i couldn't finish just one 
i would come here everyday  the food here are amazing  the wings are just so good   the truffle fries are just perfect   nothing bad to say about this place  so happy they made a korean wing place here in flushing   no need to walk all the way to northern blvd
was excited for this place but the chicken wings were nothing to rave about  we ordered the 50 50  half soy sauce and half spicy  the soy sauce was a bit bland and the spicy was     well  extremely spicy  i think mad for chicken has better wings  but i did love their bulgogi quesadilla   something different but delicious  and their truffle fries  the truffle fries is a pretty large order and the fries are super crispy  9 we also ordered budae jjigae and same thing  a bit bland and the serving size is tiny  i'd give it more of a 3 5 stars but not sure if i'd come back 
like their french fries!worth a try pretty awesome place with awesome design  will come back again for girls talk here for sure!
went there once for lady night~ good environment and not bad food   could have more choices  anyway  good for gathering~
i went here for new year's eve and they had a karaoke night   great drinks  the staff was super nice  they offered us free shots   now on to the food  loved their parmesan truffle fries and their wings   in genera all of their appetizers are amazing  can't really go wrong   where i did go wrong was order the mozzarella cheese rice dish   their appetizers are great  the main dishes not so much  but i still recommend it 
i always come here for their bulgogi quesadilla & their spicy pork belly sliders! also  instead of fries on the side  ask for the truffle fries  they are the bomb!
i came here with friends one night just for drinks  the bartenders were very nice and attentive  the restaurant was pretty busy  although we didn't eat we had a great time and love the place would love to come back and try some food one day 
actually i wanna give them 3and half star  but their waitress r mad wired  in the beginning  they gave us the menu and we just checking on it  one waitress came and ask us to order  im just curious what needed to be hurry? after we ordered  i requested for her to leave one menu on the table  she is like no because she is afraid the menu will get dirty lol  the wing are actually pretty good especially the soy garlic wings  but the spicy one are really spicy so be aware  overall a good place to hang out with friends!!!!
fun asian style fried chicken   $1 oyster happy hours and a mod hip vibe   another reason not to trek into the "city" for food 
came here for a friend's birthday  we reserved a table for a party of 10  they split us up into 2 tables at first  but we all wanted to sit together and socialize  so we asked to be switched to a bigger table  they were very accommodating and was able to do that  you get a free drink if you check in on yelp! of course  i took up that opportunity  )the food is ok  the chicken wings were good  nice and crispy and had good flavors  we also had the octopus  the korean stews and a variety of foods  the kalbi we ordered was dry and over cooked  we ordered 3  they were very nice and switched it to the bulgogi for us  the bulgogi tastes a lot better!the spicy seafood stew was tasty and spicy! but that is coming from someone that can't handle too much spice overall  the service and the atmosphere is good  the prices are more on the pricier end 
flushing needs more late night places like this!!! love the seafood soups  they're always good for sharing for at least 2 people and the pitcher soju cocktails are good for 2+ or just one  if you're greedy haha
the food was pretty good  i loved the truffle fries and the wings  it took a while for all the food to come out though but the overall experience was not bad  the bartender kept flirting with my friend though which was a bit uncomfortable (for him) and humorous for us and his girlfriend  if you want something spicy the kimchi fried rice will do it 
the 3 stars are given based on ambiance  food  and service  i will definitely touch upon cleanliness!ambiance  this restaurant bar is dim and modern  most of the restaurants within this building of hyatt hotel are modern and trendy  they definitely let you feel like you transported out of chinatown and into manhattan  they have tv's therefore its a pretty nice place to just hang out and watch music videos that do not go with the music they are playing  i was listening to an upbeat rihanna song and the music video was a sad korean song  haha it was very weird  it is very obvious their target is the young professionals and college students  the tables were places closely together  but i guess they had to in order to make enough seatings  the tables for 2 were pretty small  and you are seated on benches so "do not lean back  you will fall"  which is weird at a bar because if anyone gets drunk then they are definitely tipping over  this is where they lost some points for me  overall the ambiance is trendy and welcoming food  i tried the quesadilla  half and half wings (spicy sweet)  and the spicy pork belly  the quesadilla was decent  not great or terrible  but extremely moderate  this is where they lost some points with me too  i feel like they could have done more to make it flavorful and excite my tastebuds  they placed it on a white plate with a dip  but since the quesadilla was small  you see a lot of the plate  maybe they could have used a smaller plate to save space on the small tables  the wings were crisp on the outside  juicy on the inside  moist and flavorful  i think they did a good job on the wings although i have had places that made it better  but its worth trying and going back for if you are in the area  out of the three i was most satisfied with the spicy pork belly  it was made very well  better than many places  they serve plenty of pork belly  if you order rice on the side  you will definitely feel full or satisfied in the end  although this is a korean restaurant  keep in mind it is a bar  therefore they wouldn't give you many small side dishes people might expect  this is definitely worth trying and going back for  service  once you enter you will be warmly greeted and quickly seated  they are attentive and make sure to keep your cups filled with water or tea  they come around to check on you in a non annoying way  the water is pre soaked with lemons  which is great because i always enjoyed lemons in my water  the service wasn't wonderful  but it was good enough the major reason i took away one whole star from the rating  is due to cleanliness  i had a dirty cup  i didn't notice until my boyfriend placed the candle right by my glass cup  that was when i noticed lots of watermarks  and stains  i felt disgusted after  our spoons had dry rice stuck on it  and my boyfriends plate had some black things stuck to it  i tried to clean it instead of bothering them for a new plate  but the black thing didn't come off  it smeared all over  we were kind of turned off by this and decided to just eat everything the best we can and hope we do not get sick afterwards  overall  i would recommend coming here with friends to just hang out and try a dish or so  but do not bring you date here  in case you come across dirty plates and utensils  you might not get a second date  haha   
best korean friend chicken in queens  amazing service and excellent food  servers are very friendly and if you go in a group they give some appetizers on the house 
came here with a party of 10  considering i've been to mad for chicken plenty of times for their perfectly cooked soy garlic wings  i did not expect much  i've been to numerous spots for their soy garlic and it was always a disappointment  this spot is actually comparable  nice atmosphere  even gave us complementary shots  the spicy wings are not as spicy as most places  so i definitely recommend  truffle fries are on point  it's at a convenient location just across the street from 66  coming back soon!
enjoyed an excellent late nite post theatre meal on the rear patio of this great restaurant  the service was quite good and the food excellent 
overall i will give them 3 starts  we ordered two dozens of oysters  oysters are very fresh  the wings are alright  spicy wings are decent; garlic wings are like regular chicken wing  doesn't taste like garlic i will give them  100 start for their seafood pancake 
everything here was mediocre   restaurant bar design was decent but the food was a bit of a disappointment   we asked to replace the regular size of fries with the truffle fries (how the heck do you eat all those fries of the side fries are mandated as part of the order? ! what a waste of potato) and offered to pay more but the waitress and manager refused    not very accommodating 
for the past few times here   i ordered the chicken and i love love love the taste  the spicy is so spicy and perfectly tangles my taste buds  the sweet potato fries is perfectly cooked and i love the blue cheese that comes with it   truffle fries is amazing too and i love the cheese sauce 
the food here is amazing  particularly the fried chicken! drinks are really awesome too! must visit if you are in flushing!
best wings in flushing  happy hour oysters  i like the bossam as well  one of the few places in flushing you can watch the game  have a drink and have good food  the space is new  modern  and has a western bar restaurant layout which you won't find in many places in flushing 
once again loved the food!! short ribs sooo good  the oysters are top shelf !! so sweet and fresh  the owner ken introduced himself and seemed attentive to customer satisfaction  he even comp us a round of shots because of our postive feed back on the food  his dedication  will ensure consistent quality!! nice guy!!
i came here on a friend's insistent recommendation and i wasn't disappointed  i brought my boyfriend here for our first date and it was perfect! the service is friendly  the bar is well stocked  and best of all  while the menu is varied  you really just can't go wrong with whatever you pick  we ended up having their wings and the special fries with a bottle of soju  the food came out pretty quickly and it tasted delicious  the portions were sizeable too as we ended up having to take some to go (really can't be wasting wings like those)  the noise level is comfortable  the environment is chic   and the owners are really sweet  i'd definitely come back again!
we order the half and half fried chicken   it's really crispy and has a lot of flavor  the parmesan truffle fries and pork belly marinated in a spicy sauce 
the not so hidden gem in flushing  the restaurant is honestly a breathe of fresh air  it isn't just your everyday korean food and it is a nice break from all the chinese options you come across at every corner  you will feel as if you left flushing for a moment and entered a cute restaurant in the city  this is the only restaurant in flushing that serves $1 fresh oysters during happy hours  yes   happy hour   which is pretty uncommon in flushing to begin with  from wings to oysters to a variety of amazing cocktails  this is definitely the place to be from 4pm 7pm (m f) everything on their menu is unique and yummy in your tummies  but here are my top 3 (besides the wings oysters) that you must try during your first visit  and trust me  it won't be your last 1  bulgogi quesadilla  a must  i am sure you've already read enough reviews about this  people are not lying  this is the bomb  this is the one dish i always get  it is perfect for one person  if your goal is to try multiple things on the menu  i would recommend getting this to share  2  mozzarella fondue  heaven in your mouth  i didn't really know what to expect when i ordered this  the combination of melted mozzarella cheese & sweet pumpkin just seemed like a weird combo to me since i've never a huge fan of mixing sweet and savory  however  this was the perfect combination in my opinion 3  jogae tang  worth it  try it  you won't regret it  it's not just your simple clam soup  first off  it is huge so definitely share it with someone  let this be a warning  they are not cheap with their clams     or the veggies  i am actually more in love with the soup itself  the soup is so refreshing and tasty  it honestly goes perfectly with everything you order 
i really liked this place  well priced and the vibe is relaxed and fun  would definitely recommend 
go during happy hour! $1 oysters and $3 draught beer! nothing can go wrong with that!
feels like sitting in the manhattan restaurant and bar   excellent waiter  waitress  bartender and wonderful food!!! i'll go back to this place within this week  two thumbs up!!!
overpriced for a strange or unique dining experience  food is unique  a mishmash of korean and american dishes  the service is great  but you're paying a premium for ambiance  which isn't anything special  i like the place but they're off on their pricing  it's not close to a fine dining experience but a casual dinner for two will run you close to a hundred dollars and the seating isn't exactly very roomy 
this is a great place to dine with friends  comfortable and fun atmosphere  the food is excellent and the service is even better  kimchi egg roll is very good  blue point oysters are great too  oysters are apparently $1 each during happy hour 
i didnt know this place existed until my friend took me here  it was a very casual place  not loud or not quiet  the portion of foods werent bad  my favorite food here was truffle fries!
came here last night (sunday) at around 8 00 pm  as expected we were seated immediately  staff gave us the menu   went through it we know what we wanted after 2 3 minutes of sitting down  staff were passing by  handing out food to everyone else around us and not one of them offered us a glass of water or asked if we were ready  i told my boyfriend  i'll give this place about 5 more minutes since he really wanted to try the wings then we'll leave  after 10 11 mins of being seated and waiting  someone finally came to us and asked if we were ready  wings were delicious! sliders and quesadillas were also good   giving them 3 stars for the staff 
besides the happy hour deal  their stuff is way over priced for the quality of the food  i have tasted better korean chicken wings before that cost way less  their kimchee fried rice was unpleasant to be honest  you can get better and cheaper kimchee fried rice at any other korean restaurant in the local area  the only thing you're paying for is the ambience  they have a great interior  but i wish the food was just as amazing  however their service is really great  nothing to complain about 
my favorite late night to go restaurant! their chicken wings and gratin are so addicting!! their staff is really friendly  but they don't really refill water until you ask  their portion for the seafood soup and budae jigae is small  definitely not enough for a big group  their drinks are good 
this is a relatively new place in flushing  so i came here to try it out  overall  i was quite disappointed by the food  the ambiance follows suit to most les bars restaurants and the service level is on par  i had ordered the following items 1   gratin   "stir fried rice topped with a mozzarella cheese béchamel sauce choice of grilled meat kimchi   bulgogi"  doesn't this sound amazing?!? i wanted to like it but i thought the execution of this dish was tactless  i think the main issue was the ratio of the mozzarella cheese relative to the rice and kimchi or bulgogi  it was literally like eating a bowl of cheese  if you are into just eating cheese  this dish would be for you  but instead of a 4 1 ratio  i would request to have less cheese and more rice and bulgogi  or at least a better ratio to equate to that perfect balance  2  bulgogi quesadilla   i thought this was very bland  i had to add flavor to this with additional condiments  the flavors were underwhelming  i couldn't taste the bulgogi as it was overpowered by the cheese and flour  i would recommend adding bits of kimchi to give this a kick  3  the coop wings   half spicy   half garlic  nothing amazing  on par with most of the korean style chicken places (mad for chicken  kyochon etc)  for awesome wings  i would recommend debasaki disclaimer  my experience was based on this sample population of dishes  i haven't tried their other dishes and those may be a hit 
the coop has good chicken wings and makgeolli (traditional rice wine)  two things koreans cannot get wrong   the ambiance is geared toward upwardly mobile trend setters who like to spend money and hang out in cool places   in the evening  the music and general noise level can be very loud   the waiters are attentive  but may not get to your table if the place is crowded  would definitely recommend to all the young hipsters moving into flushing 
expensive but good! convient that it's right next to my favorite bar  chicken  was spicy!
i ordered the soy sauce chicken and the truffle fries today  ordered three orders of the 12pc chicken and two orders of the fries for six people  it was definitely enough and the total was around $78(including a $10 tip)  great ambience too and would 100% recommend this place
my husband and i visited the coop during a foodie weekend in flushing in july   we had soju bombs  bulgogi sliders with fries and korean chicken wings   the service from jacob was fantastic  the restaurant is very clean and convenient   the food was delicious but the soju bombs were the star!!  we definitely will go back and share with friends!
came here because they were handing out $20 coupons in front of skyview mall  their wings are pretty standard korean fried chicken wings (like bonchon)  but super tasty nonetheless  the spicy wings are actually spicy (i love szechuan food and these wings were hot  ) and i enjoyed the soy garlic wings very much  their truffle parmesan fries were good  but order this to share because the taste gets tiring after a while (ordered this for 2 people with huge appetites and it was still too much for us)! their whole chickens are okay  i really enjoyed it but some parts were a little too burnt (bitter) and maybe a tad bit greasy  i've been craving this lately  but it's so expensive so   overall pretty good! the servers were also attentive and multilingual!
by far one if the best finds in flushing and it's new! just went this week and love the new commercial buildings here in flushing  first of all besides the great location for any foodie to stumble upon  the decor and atmosphere is great  i love the dark tones in colors when you walk in  it gives the place a nice cooling feel and very casual but very neat and organized set up  the staff is really friendly and super on top of things  they are very well versed and quick paced and observant  the music adds to the place  very popping music  the food now the food is the best part! you have to go for the wings! all my friends love them and as a person who does not eat meat only seafood i almost caved after 7 years for those wings   so goooooo! the kimchi shaghetti is really tasty and the sweet potato fries and truffle fries are made to perfection and the speciality sauses are really great! the oysters are one dollar each during happy hour and super clean arererendnd delicious!
good food  drinks and its affordable  nice little spot in downtown flushing  used the check in deal and order a free mojito(a tad too sweet but other than that it was on point)
the waitresses and bartenders have the best service i've experienced thus far  they are very attentive to my party of people  they have great upbeat music to listen to  i kind of wish they got rid of the tables in the middle to allow dancing to make it into a club or something hahaa  but i would definitely recommend this place for anyone wanting to have lunch or dinner  or to just drink 
this is my new favorite restaurant in flushing  what makes this place stand up as oppose to other restaurants in flushing is the amazing service  this place is super clean  the wait staff pays superb attention to your needs  and the food is great i think everyone can enjoy the chicken and fries here  they only have four beers on draft  but at least they have guinness (many asian venues do not have guinness because they don't know anything about beer) the ambience is great  a lot of korean pop music  very enjoyable whether you're korean or not  the place is very trendy and beautiful great for a group of friends or family  i highly recommend this to anyone 
the waitress and bartender are super friendly  the food is great and the atmosphere is so relaxing  the interior is really nice  they have a projector to show music videos on the walls!!!!! i love this place and i definitely would reccomend and come again  )
location  eh    i don't like the fact that it is in flushing flushing    its annoying to walk to let alone find parking  atmosphere  pretty cute    food  didn't get into the complicated menu and went with the kimchi fried rice and whole chicken   my bf made his mission to finish the whole chicken    he did    he said it was pretty good but reminded him of the kfc grilled chicken   lolthe kimchi fried rice was good    i would def  get it againit was happy hour and the price was confusing   the regular menu offers 12 piece chicken wings    i forgot the price   but the happy hour menu offered 6 piece wings for half the price of the regular menu    (not really a deal)beers were on point    everything was served cold and not some lukewarm beeri'd probably come back and try the rest of the menu    i probably won't come during the weekends though since its hard to get to unless you are walking a distance  my tip  don't drive and you will have a blast  )
my time spent at the coop was a reunion accompanied with some of the most important people in my life so it was hard not to have a good time  the bar was very generous in giving us complementary soju bombs  which made the oysters taste even better  plus the wings were good  def worth the wait  check this place out
so i've been here twice and each time its been phenomenal  the staff is young and friendly  the food is great  i must say hands down the best wings i've ever tasted ever and the sweet potato fries are unbelievably awesome  not only is the food and drinks great but the location and atmosphere is are great as well 
i would go to this place twice in a week if i could   their wings?  awesome!  their bulgogi quesadilla?  amazing! i also recommend the truffle fries if you're really hungry   the service has always been great whether you sat at the bar or at a table   they even gave us free shots twice out of the 3 times i've been there   (don't go expecting that  just be grateful if they offer it )  but overall i gotta say  that i've found my new wing spot   oh did i mention that they're open late everyday?
bartender was so bar  he didn't take care me at whole time because there is hot girl who sat on the other side  i waited for my food to wrapping it up  i was so upset his service
i ordered the soy garlic chicken  spicy rice cakes  budae jigae (a k a army stew)  and truffle fries with my friends  everything was delicious and was to my liking except the spicy rice cakes  the rice cakes was the problem  it appeared as if it was frozen and defrosted quickly  which made it to be over cooked  but  the sauce and the sesame leaf was fine  the service was friendly and had a nice atmosphere  prices were reasonable  the only reason why this didn't get a five star was because there is nothing that makes them special or distinguishes them from other places  currently  there are so many places like this in flushing and ktown (32nd st )     for example   in the event  my friend said lets go to x place instead of here  i wouldn't disagree and just say "okay"  why not make my friend happy? they are all the same 
the nicest restaurant in down town flushing  i love to go there with girls  the boss is very nice  especially the bartender  he makes good drinks  i go there at least 2 times week  always sit at the bar  awesome place to hangout!!!
my bf and i was looking a good place to drink and stay low  zebra was closed but we remembered tjat it was 1 2 off happy hr @coop so here we are  ordered a sex on the beach and white russian  we needed a snack and ordered the truffle parmesan fries  omg!!! they are to die for! so amazing  they give you two dipping sauce but good fries dont need dipping sauce 
i got a flyer last week while jn flushing and decided to have lunch here today  it's 2 blocks away from the 7 train main street stop  in a brand new complex off prince street  they did a nice job with the space  modern but not stuffy; i can see it as a late day hangout or casual dinner place  lunchtime was quiet  the food was well executed  we had the truffle fries  bulgogi quesadilla and a large order of wings  the generous portion of fries were perfectly fried and seasoned  the quesadilla was filled with yummy beef; they did not skimp on the filling  the fried chicken wings were delicious  we got the large order of 20 and they were nice to let us have just 6 of those as spicy  the spicy was not too spicy   just a slight heat and didn't numb your taste buds  we really liked the garlic soy flavor on the rest of our order  the wings were crispy and lightly sauced outside and the inside was still moist  everything we had was perfectly cooked  give this place a try if you are up for an more upscale korean gastro pub place in downtown flushing 
liked the cheap beers during happy hours   kimchi fried rice and the wings were great 
the service is like super bad  not feel welcomed  if it hadn't  have been for the good tasty food  i would have rated it a one star  in general  just simply                                 bad
i have never written a review before  but i feel that i must share on this   part of the dining experience is the attention to detail and service; i know this because i've spent the better part of my life in the service industry   i hate to say it  but the food  albeit a bit overpriced  was actually quite delicious   however  the overall experience left me never wanting to come back especially with all the other chicken places in flushing i came for lunch with my girlfriend   the menu was limited  but that's fine because i hate menus with a lot of options anyways   everything sounded good  but that was about the only good part of my lunch   first miscue  i had to flag down a waiter to take our order   i got the chicken special (can't have both soy garlic and spicy wings) and she had the bulgogi quesadilla  both came with drinks   second miscue  the guiness i ordered tasted sour  like either the keg went bad or the taps weren't cleaned   my girlfriend found a fruitfly swimming in her soda!  her food comes out  tasted pretty good and i was excited for mine   i sit around for about 30 minutes  still no food while i watch others around me get theirs   mind you  in any normal restaurant the food of a table should come out together  and when you see someone sitting at a table without food in front of them  shouldn't one of waitstaff think something is wrong?  i had to flag down a waiter to ask and he mumbled something like an apology then ran to get back and magically came out with my food right away   expecting wings with special dipping sauce and fries  i got overfried wings with ketchup and cold fries   i angrily ate my wings  left the fries  and got the hell out  needless to say  i won't be back any time soon 
i have ordered from them from flushingfood com and their chicken were amazing so i decided to go to their store to try their other foods  ordered a bulgogi gratin  which was good  a bit sweet because of the sauce  their seafood jeon was pretty good  the seafood was very fresh  their truffle fries was good and considering that it was an appetizer the amount of fries up get is amazing  the bulgogi quasadilla was pretty good  overall the food was good  the only reason i gave it a four star was because upon arrival the waiter didn't give us water  we had to ask for some 
really great korean wings! definitely delicious  even with reheating them they were nice and had a great crispy bite to them  the quality of the meat was good too  prices were reasonable and the guy taking my take out order was very friendly  definitely worth a try!
came here with my girlfriend on a sunday night  the place had very nice decor including a cool projection screen off the wall which was pretty fun to watch  the staff was very mindful and courteous  the drinks were on point aka not watered down and tasty!! the wings were amazing  i'll definitely recommend this place to others!
the food is okay  but the service is really good! we had a really nice birthday party!!! probably going back very often~~~
it's really sad to say but i won't be coming back after the first time i came  the only upside to this place is that yes the waiters are very friendly and the feel of the restaurant is very nice but in terms of food you probably could get better wings somewhere else  my boyfriend and i ordered very simple with just a  seafood pancake and 12 wings half soy garlic and half spicy  the seafood pancake was mediocre  it was literally full of scallion and there were only a few pieces of seafood  i wished there was more seafood in the seafood pancake  the wings were okay but as i said before you probably could get better somewhere else like dbsk or mad for chicken 
we always come on weekdays for the happy hour  oysters are wonderful and completely worth it  i normally don't eat oysters because i've been fated to disgusting slimy ones but not here  the mussels here are very clean and fresh  $1 mussels during happy hour is a blessing  good price on the draft beers during hh  too bad some of the waiters don't even know what they have on draft  which is strange since their draft menu doesn't change chicken wings were unfortunately pretty average  not very flavorful and the chicken was kind of hard  the other chicken places are better  which is disappointing since there's finally a chicken place in downtown flushing  that happy hour deal on the wings isn't even a deal  same price as the regular menu except you can order half the portion  overall  everything is overpriced compared to the portions  the bulgogi gratin is good but it loses flavor after a few bites since it's mostly just the cheese on top giving it flavor  the kimchi fried rice is bland  although i'm not surprised since their kimchi is flavorless itself (kimchi comes with the gratin)  the bossam was decent with a good portion for its price compared to everything else the decor is beautiful but the seating is not comfortable  we always come as just the two of us so we get the tiny tables on the side  there's not enough space  these two seater tables are placed too close together  you'll bump into the person sitting behind you if anyone tries to get up   with the last two seater  there's a larger table for 6(?) behind it  they literally had to climb over my seat to get to their seats  the two seater tables themselves are too small  it's a problem if all of our food doesn't even fit on the table and i have to worry about knocking things over funny that the wall projection videos don't match the songs that are playing  makes for some interesting dubovers service isn't the greatest  at least earlier in the day when they're not super busy  the waiters are off on the side chatting  it might be slow but you should at least still pay attention to your customers as you are chatting  then they'll walk past the table to take care of one task  not paying attention to their surroundings  shouldn't have to flag a waiter down for water when that glass has been empty on our table for 15 minutes  or install those call buttons the decor  hh beer prices + oysters are their saving grace at this point 
nice place to hang out with friends with some beer  their fried chicken wings are amazing!! must get!! i will definitely be back to try the other food 
very nice place  brand new and clean inside  serves good  the wings are best  i will come back soon 
nice place  bulgogi quesadilla taste great  sweet and spicy chicken is a bit too sweet  might try spicy and hot one next time
good taste of the food; the chicken wing combo with half and half  truffle fires and the hot pot of special cooking  and you have to try cocktail named forest  however  the waiters kind of busy  no don't notice you call them so 4 point out of 5 
came on a sat nite but not packed  in fact it was quite empty  service was attentive  food was good 
i had great time with my friend  nice area  delicious food and modern hip interior   feels like middle of manhattan pub 
great food! wings were excellent  as well as all the other dishes we tried  great friendly wait staff and nice atmosphere within restaurant  highly recommend!
great ambiance  fun and young crowd!  the wings are wonderfully spiced   we never had soju and our table enjoyed the peach soju pitcher   will definitely come back 
love the happy hour drinks  the food is decent  nothing too extraordinary but we really like the ambience 
foods arent overpriced given the reason that it sits next to the hotel impressed by the beef quesadilla its the must try  didnt expect too much for traditional korean dishes but they turned out to be better than the fried chicken for the same price you would get 1 3 more portion of chicken if you go to m** f* c******  and the latter tastes better 
flushing development is pretty interesting and here at one fulton square you have three levels of restaurants connected by outdoor walkways inside a two building hotel and condo complex  it's the sort of thing that if i came upon it in manhattan i might roll my eyes and mutter about gentrification but it seems like exactly what flushing and queens more generally need  nice looking chinese  japanese  malaysian and korean restaurants and a rooftop cocktail bar make you feel like you're in a contemporary asian city as opposed to other parts of flushing that feel more like a time capsuled emigrant's memory of their home country circa 1980  in other words  the coop feels a little more upscale and stylish than the average korean restaurant on 32nd or northern  there are no gigantic pictures of the food served on the outside walls; and recent kpop videos play projected on a wall inside  my wife and i thought all the food was good  not spectacular but really high quality meats nicely prepared  we liked the wings  the pork belly and octopus and the spicy rice cakes  the service is really attentive and professional 
absolutely stellar customer service  the waiter knew the menu very well & explained everything  the happy hour is also extremely cheap  the food is a bit spicy but they give you plenty of side radishes & side dishes  would come back again in a heartbeat
i came here with two girlfriends and we ordered a boodaejjigae  half spicy  half garlic wings  whole spicy marinated chicken  yes  we were starving  portions were pretty big especially the jjigae  we only finished the wings and a bit of jjigae and chicken  their wings were very tasty and crunchy but whole marinated chicken was kinda soggy  boodaejjigae was a little bit blend  i am still giving this place 4 stars because their customer service was awesome  it was quite busy the night we went and the waiter forgot to bring us a can sprite we ordered  he later came back apologized for forgetting the order and not only did he bring us our sprite  he also brought us free shots of drinks  we received another round of free shots of raspberry gummy bear vodka (?) with another waiter or manager of the place and it was really really good  i thought it was great that these servers come around and check on the customers about their service  this place is very trendy and hip which is not easy to find in flushing  i will come back to try some other dish here and def gonna order their wings again 
coop is a new  fun  and trendy place! we went there to watch a mets game  which they broadcasted from their projector onto their wall  the waitstaff were super friendly and attentive  they were engaging with our group and really wanted us to be comfortable and have a fun time  we ordered chicken wings (tasty!)  ribs fondue (interesting concept  the cheese was great for dipping fries) and parmesan truffle fries (the best and a must try!)  i think we ordered 4 plates of truffle fries because we could not stop eating it  lol  we've told all our friends to try it out  and i highly recommend for you to give it a shot if you're in the area and looking for a cool  clean  and fun spot to chill at with your friends   i only recommend adding more tvs to attract sports fanatics looking for a fun place to hang out with friends and buy a ton of food drinks!
i came here late night  which btw the hrs of operation is great  i had the parmesian fries  pretty good  but the chicken wasn't anything out of this world  i prefer mad for chicken 
great ambiance and vibe  dollar oysters (happy hour 3 6) in flushing! i come here primarily for the bar after work and bartender min is great  friendly and hardworking staff on the floor as well  i love having viniq and rumchata here  not many (if any) bars carry these two liqueurs in the area 
good for a big groups of friend who drink and eat  food is excellent  service is great 
i went for my bday dinner few days ago with my friends   i loved the place  food was amazing   i loved the truffle permasian fries most and other food were amazing!!!and last thing they gave a freeee shot on the house!!!will go again!!!
i came here on new years eve with my fiance and 2 of my other friends  we came early around 530  place was not too packed at the moment  waiters were nice and the ambience inside was pretty nice  we were able to order from the happy hour menu  it ends at 6  we ordered 12 oysters  they were $1 each  18 soy garlic chicken wings  seafood pancake and truffle parmesan fries  i had a glass of wine and with a check in you can get a free drink  the wings were pretty good  but kind of small compared to other chicken places  fries were delicious  the oysters were very good  they were quite big and juicy  i was surprised to find that kind of quality in flushing  would definetly go back to get oysters next time  the seafood pancake was not good  we had to let the waiter know  it tasted very fishy and powdery  we asked to switch to a different dish  at first they said they will recook it to make it more crispy  but we were like ehhh we don't want it  waiter than called his manager over  he then allowed us to switch to something else  we ordered the bulgogi quesadilla  that tasted so much better  the bulgogi was juicy and not dry  so overall i'd say the place and food wasn't too bad  i would recommend this place 
awesome food  great truffle fries! i love their dipping sauce! love the wings so crispy and flavorful  great service would def go back
food was delicious  staff is very friendly and accommodating  our waiter wish i knew his name was fantastic  surprised wait staff like this exists in flushing 
i was sick when i came here and i had the clam soup  it was pretty good and really good with rice  the chicken was mediocre compared to debasaki or kyochon or mad for chicken  my thoughts of this place might change if i try it again but the other people i was with also thought it was okay 
i had previously visited this location with my friend and was please with the food  i decided to invite my family on 7 28 16  once again i was please with the food and my family enjoyed it  it was not until i finished paying the bill that i was disappointed  the waitress jinjoo approached me as i was leaving the restaurant asking me if i was please with the service  i told her yes and she stated that it was part of the restaurants policy to asked if we were pleased given that i didn't provided her with 15% of tip  when requested by my sister to show the policy  she refrained from saying it was a policy and said that the tip had to be split with three people  i have gone to so many restaurants and never was i asked to provide tip for all staff members  i asked to speak with the manager and was told that he or she would not be there until the evening  i received a phone call from joseph saying that the manager would contact me the next day  i am still waiting  i will never come back here again  i felt harassed for just provided 12% of tip  if the 15% is preferred than it should be part of the bill  i will also tell my friends not to come here anymore 
4star for the ambiance food wise  there are better ones out there in flushing
actually a positive 3  but 2 because it's overrated on yelponly oysters and some drinks are worth it for happy hournice dim atmosphere with questionable pop music tastefriendly service
all of the employees were extremely kind and attentive  the food was delicious and the happy hour prices were great  we weren't expecting the spicy chicken to "actually" be spicy (coming from a korean) but they were delicious  the chicken wings were the perfect crispiness and basically amazing  although slightly on the expensive side  i would say the ambiance of the restaurant and the really good customer service makes it worth it 
was so glad that there was finally a place in flushing that had korean style chicken  instead of having to take another bus to go somewhere on northern blvd or in bayside for that  love the decor and ambiance of the place  service is also great  their workers greet you as soon as you walk in and are pretty attentive  have been here so many times because i love the food  must try the bulgogi quesadilla and the truffle fries  so good  of course  you can't fail with the chicken as well  personally  i always like coming for the budae jiggae also  definitely big enough serving to feed a couple of people  can't forget about the drinks  too  they have a menu of mixed cocktails but they're also pretty willing to make whatever else you might ask for that isn't specifically on the menu  which i really like  i always go for either the red sangria or the mango mojito  i'll come at any time  whether it be a quiet sunday afternoon or a busy friday night or for happy hour  really can't go wrong with this place  )
was browsing for seafood spots around flushing and saw some really positive reviews for gupji  ended up going for late lunch on a sunday with only one other diner inside the location  initially ordered the sashimi special with 2 varieties of salmon  hamachi and fluke  all of which were really fresh  you really could taste the excellent quality of the fish used the precursor to the entree   egg custard with shrimp   had a subtle egg flavor and was very good  entrees involved a whole bronzino and sea bass steak coupled with miso soup  rice  plum sauce  kimchi  and pickled jalapeños  both fish were delicately prepared and extremely flavorful  in addition to the complimentary salad with yelp check in  i was also given a free slice of cake at the end  don't even know what it was  but like everything else  it was fantastic! i know some great flushing eats and yet was pleasantly surprised and impressed by how terrific this place was is  from the carefully appointed modern rustic interior  lighting and spacing of the tables to the extremely high quality and delicious food  you could tell a lot of thought went into delivering a great dining experience for customers  best of all the host was extremely friendly and helpful with detailing some of the dishes i wasn't familiar with  do yourself a favor and support good people and great food  they deserve your business  this place is outstanding!
seafood with a modern twist came with a group of 4 on a thursday night  we were seated immediately and served free appetizers that included their house salad and steamed egg custard  loved the dressing on the salad but i was more blown away by their steamed egg custard with shrimp aka chawanmushi  it was silky and smooth in texture  delicious and free! both appetizers were a great start to our meal that included   sweet potato croquette ($6)  deep fried mashed sweet potatoes with a mayo based sauce and takoyaki sauce drizzled on top  comes with 4 pieces  they're covered in the perfect amount of breadcrumbs  not super oily and has a crunchy exterior with a generous amount of mashed sweet potato filling  would order again   deep fried potato  hash brown  cheese stick ($8)  our plate came with 2 cheese sticks  a handful of tater tots and fries all sprinkled with dried bonito flakes on top and a drizzle of white mayo based sauce  they also bring you a side of ketchup  tbh  i think it's really hard to mess up fries and i never had anything that wasn't good after being deep fried  also  as a lover of anything potatoes i can eat two bowls of this nooo problemo   chilean sea bass ($25)  not dry  perfectly moist  soft and nicely seasoned and grilled with their chef's soy sauce  the portion for one plate might be too small for a group of 4  it's a better portion to split amongst 2 people  drizzle a bit of lemon on top and dig in  the meat just falls off and you can tell the quality is up there butttt as good at it was  it wasn't mind blowing  as in  the the price is a bit steep  might contemplate on getting this again next time if anything   hot pot fish egg rice ($16)  basically a bibimbap with different types of fish roe and vegetables served in a stone pot  you can scrape up the crunchy  nutty burnt rice on the bottom (nurungji) after you're done  it doesn't come with a sauce but the whole point is to really get all the flavors of the fish roes  some might think it's a bit salty but this was pretty on point for me   sashimi ($24)  comes with thin slices cubes of salmon  hamachi and fluke sashimi  some pieces were still thawing as if they weren't completely defrosted when they were served and the overall portion was okkk  i kinda expected more from this  just cause i loveeee sashimi but was a bit disappointed that some pieces were ice cold in my mouth overall  i like how they have a simple menu  it just means that i'd expect a bullseye for each dishes listed on there  which wasn't the case  but  i did enjoy most of then including the sweet potato croquette  fries and the hot pot fish egg rice  guess i'll just have to go back to try some of their other items on the menu  this is a great date spot or to eat a nice simple  clean meal with your friends  we left feeling happy full  not the i'm going get food coma kinda full  also  i wouldn't bring more than 4 people  just because of limited space and seating inside  parking can also be a hassle if you're here during the peak hours since there are so many other restaurants around this area  service is ok  the servers aren't super talkative or anything  hey take your orders  bring them out and let you be  i like that since it always rubs me off the wrong way when servers take your plates away and immediately assumes that you want the check afterwards  you feel rushed to leave that way  which is a pet peeve of mine  anyways  will definitely poke my head in again when i'm in the mood to #treatmaself with some seafood the next time i'm around the area 
neighborhood spot that i've been really wanting to try   went here on a whim on a friday night at around 7 30 pm  small and intimate  jazzy korean music playing in the background and just a few tables  great service and servers but the food wasn't all that it was hyped up to be sashimi special  fresh fish  sweet and sour soy sauce with wasabi was delicious mushroom  beef nabe udon  bland and one note fish roe stonepot bibimbap  salty from the roe but was definitely missing a sauce of some sort  kimchi bits didn't have a place there all in all  it was what i expected but wanted the flavor to be a bit amped up for a fusion  modern spot  not sure if i'll revisit but the servers were great  tentative and nice!
we came in after watching the latest star wars moving in fresh meadows and wanted small dishes rather than big entrees  we got the wasabi octopus with seaweed  spicy tuna salad  and pan fried oysters  before our orders came  we received complimentary egg custards  they were good but i still think ootoya has the best  but being it is a free item  it's certainly not bad  the first dish that arrived was the spicy tuna salad  it was more tuna than salad and it's honestly not a bad thing  along with the argula  there was thinly slices of apples and red onion  halved cherry tomatoes added color to the salad  the spicy tuna itself wasn't too spicy but i suspect that we had to mix in the sirracha ourselves and we didn't do that  the next dish was the wasabi octopus and seaweed  this octopus mix may look bland but it packed so much invisible spiciness in there! the wasabi was present throughout  you have to assemble your own little bite    a sheet of nori  some octopus pieces  and some cucumbers sticks  the wasabi spiciness is unique and addictive  i am not a spice fan and this dish was hands down spicy  but i find myself going back to it over and over again  when it got too spicy  i would eat the salad and the egg custard to balance it out  even when we finished the nori and cucumbers  i was fishing for more of the little pieces of octopus from the dish  the pan fried oysters came out last  it also came with a dipping soy sauce of some sort  the oysters were uniformly the same size and relatively plump  it wasn't super special in my opinion but it didn't taste bad either  maybe they can make it special by creating different dipping sauces  lastly  service was solid and very courteous  however  their english is not the best so i relied on yelp reviews and pictures to guide me on what i order  we also got seated literally right in front of the restroom  thank god no one "really" needed to use it  not the best seats in the house  parking in the area was also hard to find on a saturday night  so be prepared to drive around to look for parking if you're not taking public transportation 
the food is good here  they have a simple menu but a few different seafood selection  i got the sashimi  the tuna was not that fresh can tell by the color and taste  the salmon is usually always the same every place i've been to  the hamachi is pretty good but it was still frozen so i had to wait awhile to eat it  the sweet potato croquette is good  it taste a bit like curry  the gupji ribeye steak was cooked well  i liked how the steak tasted a little bit like sausages  the house salad is on point  i really liked it and ordered two of them  ambience is nice  small place with mellow music  good place for a date  i think i would come back here  i was expecting more from the sashimi  if it was more fresh and less frozen i would have given it a 4 star 
service is great  very friendly  food is on par  we got a lot of salmon dishes as recommended by the waiter  love the pork belly grill  so good  bit pricy tho  and place is not that big  its a nice spot for after work drink and chit chat 
my friend and i had dinner at this restaurant tonight  we tried the hot pot fish egg and hot plate rice w salmon  food was absolutely delicious! both dishes had a spicy kick  dishes were nicely portioned  we left w our bellies stuffed! staff were super nice and friendly  ambience was quiet and cozy  definitely coming back here soon!
great service and food  gem in the area  nice place to hang out with friends and family  food is more on the asian fusion style  will visit often 
my new favorite late night eats place!this isn't a traditional korean restaurant; they focus more on their seafood  the menu also isn't very big so every dish is basically made to perfection imo  this place is also very small  even though they're known for their seafood  i got the mushroom and beef soup & pork belly i checked in yelp for their house salad  they also give you steamed egg as a complimentary appetizer  everything was super delicious  i didn't expect the pork belly to be amazing but it was  this place is pretty pricey  but it's pretty worth it imo  will deff come back  my only complaint is that seating isnt flexible at all my boyfriend and i walked in at about 11 pm and there were only two other parties there  we wanted to sit at a certain table because the only two party table was next to a bunch of drunks but the waitress said she couldn't sit us there just in case other parties walk in  there was about a few empty tables and it was late  this place doesn't get that much business so it was kind of annoying sitting next to a bunch of loud drunks & no one else came in during our stay there  we left around 12 30 am?even though that rubbed us the wrong way  our waitress was still very nice 
nice cozy little spot for some small plate eats  a new addition to the area that is already horrible for parking  if you're driving  plan ahead of time! i would recommend calling for reservations as well  since there is limited tables  i would not recommend large groups for this place  we ordered literally everything on the menu and the only one that stood out was the eel dish! (see photo)  plump and tasty  if you want a nice date spot or a spot to chat with a friend and catch up  i would recommend coming here  i do hope they add more things to the menu in the future 
walking into the somewhat dimly lit restaurant  i immediately loved the vibes  my friend and i came in a bit earlier than their opening time but we were seated with hot tea and were able to look at the menu  (tip  check in to get free house salad  $6)  salad  spinach salad with tomato  mango  and red onion  and a light vinaigrette  a very light and refreshing way to start your meal  fish hot pot fish egg rice ($16)  it was served in a clay pot and everything was nicely sizzling inside  i didn't really get a good at it because i just told my friend to mix everything up (sorry i was hungry   ) nicely seasoned and had an interestingly good texture from the slight crunch of the fish eggs  chilean sea bass ($23)  s o g o o d  breaking off a small piece  you know right away how fresh the fish was  it was nicely seared  seasoned  (i hate using this word  i'm sorry but it's the only word that comes to mind right now)    but   moist   i really hate dry fish and i gotta say they prepared it really well  the one thing that might make this even better is if they gave a bit more  for $23  i honestly was expecting more  but for the quality and freshness of the fish  it's kinda worth it  kinda  side dishes  kimchi  lotus root  soup (they only gave us 1 bowl  and we had to split)  fish thing wrapped in egg omelette (?)   i actually got hyped up reading reviews thinking i would get more  side dishes  but this was all we got  presentation of food  10 10service  given that we were the only ones in the restaurant at the time  the waitress was attentive and constantly refilled our tea overall  for the quality and freshness of their food  their price is somewhat reasonable  i would come to try their other dishes  but only order their seafood when i feel like splurging 
cuisine  7service  7decor  7value  7overall  7cute little shop focused mostly in grilled fish  such as mackerel  belt fish  chilean sea bass  and many others  they do a pretty good job at it   i also like their sweet potato croquette and the house salad appetizers 
what an interesting fusion of 2 of my favorite cuisines  japanese & korean!i really enjoyed the food here  and not to mention the service was great as well  they were very attentive  and interested to know what we thought of in terms of their food  we had ordered   seafood platter from the today's special  the seafood was very fresh and i really enjoyed the sauce as well   freshwater eel  i thought it was very good and it also came with rice and soup  which they offer free refills  they also provided complementary  congee  tasty! salad  sauce was really good as well!ambience was amazing  and it definitely felt more like a city restaurant than the typical ones you see in flushing  it's very cozy will come back again!!
cute restaurant  i love that it opens til late  as for the food  i find that only their pork belly dish is good  kinda overpriced  their on the house salad and egg "dessert"? is really good  but that's all i could really say  i haven't exactly tried everything  but i was pretty disappointed in their fresh water eel 
the place is pretty small and the waitress wasn't flexible to assign the seat  the food was okay  the waitress recommended us the chilean sea bass  it was delicious! we also ordered the eel  the waiter told us we need to eat with sesame leave and ginger with little bit of eel sauce  it tasted different from what i except "eel"  it was kinda fresh feeling for me  for all other foods was okay 
saw some great reviews so i have to come give this place a try  it's a small restaurant with good looking decor  very woody and uses pipes for the electrical cables which look cool most complicated menu to read in my opinion  nothing is really categorized   it's just listed one after another and that was very confusing because there was fish and rice and meat all listed together i had ordered the poke belly with sea salt and my girlfriend ordered the fish with fish eggs fried rice and we had some assorted fries to start  the pork belly came out sizzling hot and it was very flavorful and delicious  overall the food was pretty good  the waitress that helped was very nice and food came out in an orderly  manner  probably a place i would come back to and eat in again 
gupji is maybe a 20 minute walk from main st  flushing so it's pretty close to there if you want some exercise  but going back i would drive   this place has a lot going for it   tasty food  a laid back atmosphere and not too overcrowded  and reasonable prices my wife and i had the pork belly  fried shrimp with sweet potato and some oysters as a side dish   they served us complimentary house salad after i checked in on yelp and they also gave us steamed egg in a tiny bowl (that was good too  and free) i'll add some pictures but i do want to point out something my wife noticed  the two chefs in the back were doing every order on their own   maybe there were three or four other tables with guests and the two kitchen staff were cooking and plating food non stop  and i'm sure all the dishes were great (because ours were)   i have no experience with the restaurant industry but i think that's pretty rare to see  and you can see it yourself too  it's an open kitchen after going there i can see why it has an average 4 5 star rating  it's a great hole in the wall   also  they said they don't have a dessert menu  we asked  but i see some other people bragging in their reviews about getting a pumpkin   squash dessert   maybe you just have to be super cool or catch them at a certain time 
came here with my sister after being out and about in flushing with friends  it was a quiet night and there was only us and another group of friends dining at the restaurant  the space is small  but does give that kind of intimate vibe  their specialty was their grilled seafood and my sis and i were intrigued to try some we ordered fried oysters to start  grilled sea bass and the fish egg hot pot  the meal started with a fresh apple  greens  grape tomato salad with a sweet dressing and miso soup  the meal also came with a complementary congee and potato pancakes  the sea bass was grilled to perfection being crispy and moist at the same time  the oysters were a delight with a sweet and salty flavor  the fish egg hot pot was delicious as the combination of the three different fish eggs  rice and seasoning was a flavorful bite the staff was very nice and very attentive to make sure our cup of tea was full and our tummies were happy with the meal  we will definitely go back again one day 
a big fan of gupji!my boyfriend and i came around 5 30pm for dinner on a wednesday night  the restaurant wasn't very full  so we were able to get a table easily we ordered the fish cake udon  spicy tuna salad  and hot pot fish roe rice  the udon and the tuna salad were pretty standard  but the hot pot fish roe rice was amazing! it's similar to a bibimbap   it comes with three or four different types of fish roe  some vegetables  and some sauce in a sizzling stone bowl  you mix it all together and eat! it was delicious; the seafood flavor was great and it wasn't too salty or bland the best part about the meal was that it came with tons of free appetizers   we checked in and got a free house salad  then the waitress brought us both a free chawanmushi (steamed egg custard with shrimp)  free refillable kimchi and radishes  and then two free miso soups the bill came out to be about $40 before tax and tip  depending on your budget it might be spendy for dinner for two  but with all the free appetizers it felt like it was worth it  will definitely come back and would definitely recommend 
i was pleasantly surprised by this place  while their menu isn't super deep  they do a fantastic job with the dishes that they offer   this place is known for their seafood and i really enjoyed their cod soup stew   the flavor is light but they did a fantastic job of letting the freshness of the cod really shine with their minimalist approach even though fish is their thing  they also did a fantastic job with their spicy pork short rib   it was perfectly cooked and had a great crispy yet tender texture that really melted in your mouth   the spicy sauce they use is also really addictive and is a nice contrast to some of the lighter seafood offerings they also serve a variety of good appetizers such as their oysters and even their french fry basket was very tasty   even though this place may seem unassuming  the food is solid and the environment is very cozy   i wish this place was a tad bigger but honestly that's a minor gripe   if you want a mix of solid korean food  good service and pleasant ambiance  this is a a great place to check out 
very good foods and servicevery delicious mackerel salmon  everythingfresh ingredients i love it  i'll come again
stopped by for dinner with the girlfriend and the interior was pretty nice for a korean place in murray hill  not what you would normally expect we got the spicy cod soup and pork belly dishes and both were very tasty  i really enjoyed the pork belly  the only suggestion i have is that they season the meat more before cooking it  it definitely could have used more salt they have couple of drink specials during their happy hour which was from like 5 30 8 30 pm i believe  ob and hite costs 4 dollars during that time and soju costs 7 bucks  they have most of the soju flavors iirc all the food here is geared toward drinking but you don't need the drinks to enjoy them i'd come here again just for the pork belly!
i found this place after searching for dinner places via yelp and i am so glad i found this little gem  inside is small  probably sit about 20people and it's japanese korean fusion inspired food  and let me tell you helpers i am sitting here eating and i love the food  it really is that good  omg    i a definitely coming back  plus the service was a+  my two besties whom dine with me also agrees the food is delicious  also they gave so many freebie and side dishes  soup  salad    just see the photos  i recommend all the food that we ordered especially the hotpot of fish and fish egg rice  delicious  the eel is a+ too it melts in your mouth  best fusion restaurant by far that i went to  i would give it more than five stars if i could  come here you won't be disappointed  say jenny from yelp recommended you here 
small  but intimate place for a small meal   limited selection  but mostly tasty food 
this place offers two free appetizers before our meal which normally would have been $20   also the appetizer is very tasty the main dishes are so amazing   perfect god's creation i would definitely be back again!! thanks gup ji for the awesome meal !!
i haven't been back around this area for a while    so many new places opened up! this seemed like a cute place for a date if you're looking for somewhere nice and cozy  the food was not that impressive though  they didn't have that many options to choose from on the menu  we got a free salad and steamed egg that were complimentary to start the meal  i tried the cheese stick and potato wedges  some fried oysters (which i don't recommend getting   it didn't taste that fresh)  i also ordered a rice dish  mackerel  and pork belly to share  the portion's kind of small and the dishes are a bit pricey compared to other places in flushing  pork belly is fine  but if you're getting that i'd recommend going to a real bbq place instead  there are so many other restaurants nearby that will fill you up  i think this was a pretty unique restaurant in the area but out of all the options around here  this wouldn't be a place i'd come back to 
i came here with my girlfriend  i ordered the steak medium rare and she ordered the salmon  the starter was a free salad we got from checking in on yelp  that was pretty good  flavorful with mangos and avocados added  next thing that came out was a cute little steamed egg in what looked like a teacup  that was very yummy  the entrees came with rice  miso soup  and kimchi  i didn't love the place but it wasn't horrible  the steak wasn't special but my girlfriend did say that the salmon was really good  i wish they really had more side dishes to add to the experience  the best part of this meal was definitely the service because they were always on top of the water and napkins  seating was quick too  maybe because the place was slow but still have to give them credit
love the cozy intimate decoy  this place is known for its grilled fish  we wanted to try the grilled chilean sea bass but it was already sold out for the night  we got the grilled pork belly instead and it was delicious! would come back again to try the chilean sea bass note  check in on yelp to get the free house salad  it was tasty and fresh 
i have played biggest loser against my best friend and had to buy a dinner for losing the bet here at gupji  we had a fantastic korean grilled fish at gupji over the past weekend  never knew such a hidden gem would be in the good ole' neighborhood of flushing  samgyupsal was served masterfully and freshly grilled from the kitchen and deliciously grilled eel was served in japanese izakaya styled marinated in sweet & salty(soy?) sauce which i really enjoyed  also  deliciously grilled brazino was served with wire thinly sliced pimento sprinkled on the top  i really liked the simple and neat visual of the dish  the bistro also serves kwak beer  which ironically bears the same name as owner of the bistro mr  kwak himself  lol~ i highly recommend this place if you have tried korean traditional meal 'hanjungsik' and liked!
i enjoyed many kinds of great japanese izakaya style food with one of best sake "dassai 23" so far i have visited twice  i see great improvement overall service  i cant wait to see how much further this place can improve food and service!!
been here many times and just love this little hidden spot   great service at all times and food never disappoints love it
i love trying new places and it is a perfect place to eat especially since it closes late  the waiter was so nice and attentive whenever we needed something  also very knowledgeable and suggests his recommendations  definitely try the pork belly and sashimi! although i wish it had more items on their menu 
this is one of my favorite restaurants to go to with my wife  you can check in to get a free salad and sometimes there is complementary steamed egg and miso soup  we always order the chilean sea bass and pork belly   seriously the best thing ever  the chef is great and sometimes give us complementary entrees  for the quality of the food served here  the price is excellent  check for the occasional specials on the menus  they are usually delicious  today we got the soft shelled crabs and concha salad along with our usuals  we always leave this place happy and full 
a nice place to visit  great service and the foods are pretty good  my ordered a grilled fish and steak  both are out standing
coolest spot for late night drinks and hangouts in murray hill  the food is very well made  mango house salad was absolutely delicious! and it was free! though the assorted fried appetizer wasn't too memorable  and the hot rice pot w fish & pork belly was just okay  the sea bass was excellent  this isn't a traditional dinner spot  but rather good for little plates appetizer size bites to snack on while getting wasted  great for group drinking  open super late  prices are moderate; their apps are ~10 15 while entrees (grilled seafood or meat) are 20s  small restaurant  nice staff 
this was a really great spot! the entrees were on point and the service was nice too  i recommend the bronzini and their special beef steak 
come here often  great little hidden spot in flushing just a one minute walk from the murray hill lirr station  great place for a date or catch up with a friend  intimate setting  tv always playing latest sport game  food is healthy clean and fresh  homemade fruit soju  seems like a trendy manhattan spot in flushing  the cream cheese salmon salad and the mango soju and my favs
amazing dinner experience at gupji! got a free house salad when i checked in and it was delicious  super small and cozy place  but you can really taste the effort that goes into each individual dish  from what i could tell there was pretty much only one chef who was doing all the cooking  but everything came out fairly quickly and every single dish  including the side dishes were great! i wish  they had a little more variety on their menu but it was an amazing and surprising find in a neighborhood full of big kbbq type restaurants 
bronzini is my favorite  this place is hidden jam in flushing  every single piece is thoughtful and delicious  i pretty much go this place every evening with fellow workers  i love here so much 
amazing food   great place for date night or cozy night w a close friend  has limited seating which made us feel more special and cared for!
this place is a hidden gem! it's a little small  and is more suitable for a small group or just two  the food here is delicious and fresh  and i'm not a fish lover! i would definitely return and recommend to friends  you won't be disappointed 
i stopped in on the long drive from the hamptons to manhattan  a great little place on a block full of interesting places   i had grilled mackerel  which was delicious  as well as wasabi octopus with sushi seaweed to roll it in   in a strange way  it tasted like the gefilte fish and horseradish of my youth   probably because their wasabi tasted like good horseradish   got the complimentary salad for checking in with yelp (or at least trying to  as i shower the waitress)  as well as that egg custard thing with a bit of shrimp thrown in   saw some good looking fried shrimp someone else had  then walked over to coffee factory for dessert  then back on the grand central parkway  a few pounds heavier 
i don't understand why people are rating this place with 5 stars i came here with with my uncle and dad and we were not satisfied  the dishes are so expensive when they only give a small portion  not a lot of side dishes either  we felt like we were in manhattan 
i ate al bab seafood combination fresh water eel and pork belly  everything was perfect and nice salad and dessert i want to try another one next time and i strongly recommend this restaurant b
the boyfriend and i stopped by yesterday for dinner at their opening time  we ordered the spicy tuna salad  and pan fried oysters for starters  and had a branzini and the chilean sea bass for dinner  everything was delicious  the branzini was the best i have ever had  crispy skin  flaky  moist  mild meat  with freshly squeezed lemon  just exquisite  chilean sea bass was buttery  fresh  the glaze they used was soo yummy  our meal also included some small vegetable side dishes  soup  and some fried fish meat that was on the house  their soju sake selection was impressive   as for beer  they have my fave aspall dry cider! yippee  interior decor was so wonderful on a cold winter night  old school light bulbs  brick walls  carefully selected plateware   even the music was on point  we will definitely be returning again  oh  and finding free parking was a breeze  afterwards  you can take your date to caffeine fix or coffee factory nearby  i am so happy to find a place near my home 
great place to have late night dinner with sake and sonu   i really like coming here with family and friends 
so the food is not cheap and the portion is literally baby size  taste is also not great the spicy dishes are literally just spicy and salty  i ordered spicy pork skin dish and it was by far the worse food i ever ate  bathroom was my friend for the next 5 hours  please go elsewhere
love love love everything about it  the foods 4)3 sake  the service the free extra dishes we got   open kitchen was fun too watch them serve hot foods right out of the kitchen  def my new favorite korean place!!!
love it!!! such a nice restaurant in flushing  enjoy time spent there  food absolutely goooodd!!! very detailed and deliciousss ^ ^ love their salmon! will definitely go back again with friends   ;)
best sea food place ever!! the salmon and sea bass are to die for  i've been to this restaurant three times and i haven't tried something that wasn't good or looking great  definitely worth to try  besides the amazing food  the servers are very nice  polite and on point 
good and calm atmosphere good sea food good beer and sake  this place offer good korean food with a little taste of japanese izakaya  not for people who love korean bbq but those who appreciate korean cuisine besides grilled meat will enjoy this place!
excellent food and service  can't remember exactly what i ordered but i think it was the glazed red snapper and the eel dish(only one eel dish)  total came out to be $40  also receive 3 4 service dishes from the chef  he came up to us and thanked us 
the albap was the best ive had around   interesting use of various different fish eggs brought out a unique flavor   the mackerel jorim was awesome  nuf said   their pumpkin desert was well done  simple  yet sophisticated   cant wait to try out the other dishes they have on the menu   great for either grabbing drinks with a group or for a nice cozy date   service was fantastic as well   strongly recommended 
came here base on yelp review  not your typical korean food  perfect cooked and grilled seafood is as good as it get  fresh and well seasoned  great food presentation  good attentive and friendly service  will go back and try out other dishes 
this place is the kind of gem that i only want to keep to myself  the food was unique  authentic and all the right kinds of amazing  the service was both attentive and sweet 
this place is fantastic  not what you'd expect in flushing   the foods were fresh and tasty   their grilled chilean sea bass was to die for 
i felt tearful   father  mother  daughter  son   one family working nonstop morning to night making steam rice roll that they had to eat bread for lunch during rush hour i came in around 11 am for a late breakfast and there was a mix of foreigner and locals lining up for the delicious steamed rolls  having a place like this in a highly competitive foodie town such as flushing topped with a intensive labor work is tremendously hard to keep up in the long run  coming from a hospitality background  i know how hard it is for the family to do this everyday    every minute  back to food~ do not compare this to the shrimp steamed rolls at dim sum places because the outer skin made from rice flour is much thinner  texture wise  it is different  i do enjoy this as my breakfast because it doesn't make me completely full  it is a great choice to start on your flushing food tour 
3 5 starswe ordered the small pork rice rolls with egg and scallions ($4)   it was super cool watching them make it from scratch  the actual rice roll was smooth and i loved the texture but the flavors were a little too plain for me  it's a small shop with about 8 booth seating
tasty steamed rice rolls (beef  shrimp  roast pork  plain or fish balls) that offer free add on's like corn  cilantro  scallions  bean sprouts  or lettuce   choice of 3 add on's are optional  if you add egg it's $1 more  sesame seeds on top   sweet soy sauce comes on the side to pour on   this is a food item that you usually see at dim sum places  but the rice skin is thinner and more "melty" with less bite   if you're into lighter fare this is good   i got the beef with cilantro and scallions  and the shrimp with egg  cilantro  corn and scallions added   i think i was over ambitious for a first timer and should have listened to the purist in me   less add on's would've let the flavors come thru better   the small is $4 and the large is $6  next time i'll try the roast pork with cilantro and skip the egg   this is a small family run place that's part of a mini mall across the street from the new world mall on roosevelt   the people are nice   limited seating so i got mine to go 
my boyfriend saw this on yelp and he wanted to try it  we happen to be in flushing and decided to come here for breakfast  this place is small  they share the space with other vendors  it's not very ideal to dine in  they have about 8 bar stools in front and it's first come first serve  but people usually don't stay more than 20 mins as these are more of a quick bite than a meal  to be honest there is not special about their rice noodle rolls  it is about the same from the carts in chinatown  in fact i think it is kinda pricey for rice noodle rolls  i had the rice noodle roll with fish balls and peanut sauce  i also had the one with beef  both was decent and tasted like other rice noodle rolls i had at other places  if i came back i would try their crepe or pancake  maybe it's more worth for the price than the rice noodle rolls 
popped by flushing for the lunar new year celebration  and stumbled into joe's space   located at the entrance of a mini mall  joe's counter seating is limited to 10 people steamed beef rice roll   when i first saw joe making the rice roll  i was reminded of rolled ice cream  joe pours rice roll mix onto a huge sheet pan and evenly spreads it to all corners  he then layers on the toppings  rolls it up  and shoots it into a huge steamer  a few minutes later  joe pulls out the pan  cuts the rice roll into bitesized pieces  layers on the sweet soy sauce  and voila  waited 8 minutes for it and downed it in 30 seconds  chinese pancakes   tried one with crab meat  egg  and lettuce  and another one with sausage  egg  and lettuce  i usually go with sausage  but crab meat won me over on this one soymilk   ordered fresh soy milk with sugar  and found it to be a little thick for my tastes will definitely be back for more steamed rice rolls 
really great place for rice rolls and huge portion sizes  this place is pretty hard to spot unless you actually look for it  but is definitely worth it  it's also cash only  came around 3pm and we were able to find seating  but wouldn't count on it during rush hours  we ordered two "small" size rice rolls to share and we could barely finish  rice rolls with the curry fish balls and hk peanut sauce  a must try! the peanut sauce was amazing and pairs well with the rice roll and fish balls  for all rice rolls you can add three vegetables for free or an egg for $1  but per the staff's recommendation we didn't include any veggies or the egg  pretty glad we didn't as the flavors might become overwhelming if you add to much to this rollshrimp roll with egg  scallion  corn and lettuce  really enjoyed this rice roll as well  it would probably be second to the rice roll with the curry fish balls and is quite filling  i had skipped a meal  but still couldn't finish this roll even in the "small" size  would recommend putting egg in any of the non fish ball rice rolls though as it does add extra flavoroverall would highly recommend this place  it's super affordable (most of the small rolls are only $4 and are extremely filling) and really tasty unique

this spot like many in flushing is a well hidden gem   honestly  i walked by it like twice before i finally found it   in all fairness i was also panting with excitement and probably not paying the closest of attention   immediately upon walking inside i was mesmerized by the whole process of making a steam rice roll   i stood there for a solid 5 minutes just open mouth starring trying to understand the symphony of movements needed to make this dish   first a huge ladle of batter is poured into a large sheet pan and placed inside the steamer   as swiftly as one goes in another cooked one comes out and gets the full treatment of necessary requested ingredients   in my case  bbq pork  an egg ($1 00 extra)  scallion  cilantro  and corn   it gets carefully rolled up using two pastry scrappers and then gets divided into perfect bite size pieces   the finishing touch involves a quick once over with some soy sauce and boom perfection is served i can not tell you how much i loved this   the consistently of the rice roll is just out of control   it is difficult to describe but it's incredible like nothing i have ever tasted   every bite had little pearls of pork  brightness from the cilantro  saltiness from the soy  and chewiness from the roll   i am so blessed to be able to walk here from my apartment   and did i fail to mention that this marvel was only $5 00?!  i shared a small with my mom and it was more than enough for us   so forget about that old boring bec and get on this new 2018 breakfast treat    or lunch    or dinner   or snack 
what  a pleasant surprise!joes steamed rice rolls are made fresh  right before your eyes  i ordered one small beef roll which came with 3 toppings  i chose  scallion  cilantro  and corn  i also got a small dried shrimp  order with the same 3 toppings  the blend  of flavors with hosin sauce  soy sauce  and peanut sauce and roasted  sesame sprinkled on top was such a great breakfast! the rice rolls are thin and delicate  you can add an egg too! additionally  i got to watch their pancakes be made while eating  what a great experience!it gets a bit cold with the door  being opened and closed  but the food will take  your mind off it  i found that the small rolls  were a good bargain because  my friend  ordered a large  and his plate looked the same  but had thicker rolls the owner  joe is really nice! i ordered 2 orders of the beef rice rolls  to go for my parents  gotta share the good food! looking forward to trying more flavors in the near future 
is it a trek to get here from manhattan? yes  but mmm it's so delicious  in flushing  they automatically speak to you in chinese so i was able to get by   but it sounds like from the other reviews they are ok with english as well! i love shrimp rice rolls from dim sum so that's what we went with  their fresh shrimp with scallions and cilantro  so yummy  we stopped by here before we had lunch somewhere else and shared a small size  it's so fresh  and made right in front of you    i just wish they weren't so far away!! i could easily eat 2 plates of this    ) easily shareable though as they cut it for you!
most delicious rice rolls i have ever tasted! doesn't even compare to rice rolls on a dim sum cart  when you walk in you can see the owner making rice rolls to your right    tedious looking process  in learning about the restaurant  we found out that joe purchased a special rice roll steamer which makes the rice rolls extra delicious and juicy  his rice mixture is also the perfect mix and combination of flours  we ordered the beef and egg rice roll and it was a big enough portion for two people to share  it was moist  savory  and perfectly spicy with a little chili oil on top  definitely going back!
no frills bar seating inside what looks like a small shopping center in the middle of flushing  the space was reminiscent of taiwan where we ate around the chef in night markets  so  how are the steam rolls? amazing  you can't get this quality in brooklyn  they are fresh and made to order with a large variety of toppings  my favorite is the beef with egg  lettuce  and corn with sesame seeds and soy sauce seasoning  the curry fish balls with peanut sauce was really good too  being the fatties we are  we also ordered a pancake with fried pork and egg  which was also made fresh right in front of us  salivating ensued  this is my ultimate comfort food  not a great place to bring more than one person since seating is limited but awesome for a quick bite!
joe's does it right  the rice rolls were delicate  thin  fresh and made within minutes  tasty  etc   they give you the option of adding an egg  for $1 which i highly recommend  the egg is intermixed with the noodles and it just adds some extra tasty protein  i ordered one small plate and they were so delicious i had to get another one  first order was with fresh shrimp and cilantro and egg  the second order was the curry fish ball order which was different since they top the rolls with the peanut curry sauce  can't go wrong with either choice quite frankly  "i call it like i eat it "#refereeats
it's definitely worth of try if you are in the area  i thought i wouldn't like it but it was dang delicious i come here at least once a week to eat the rice noodles  it's freshly made for you on the spot  it's not pre made! it's fresh! love it!i have work at 11am so my friend and i come here in the morning to eat if i'm not late for work  i always order the shrimp rice roll with corn & egg my friend always order beef rice roll with corn  egg  lettuce and scallion the rice roll are thin  it come with a sauce on top and hot sauce on the side if you need  also their oden soup is the bomb! i love their soup! they have fish ball  and etc  i only drink the soup so idk exactly what's there  they have this crepe egg  spam and etc i think  mostly the time i went there is the lady who makes it  i highly recommend everyone to try!they don't accept credit card! only cash
ca$h onlylocated by the front door of a small shopping mall kind of building in flushing  this place makes you custom ordered rice rolls in the matter of minutes   you choose the type of meat and vegetables that go in the rice rolls  and voila  you'll have your steamed rice rolls in only a couple of minutes because they are made to order  i think these tend to be fresher than most rice rolls at most dim sum places   they have some bar type area where you can sit and eat the rice rolls   be sure to put any vegetables that you'd like in the rice rolls  it's not like they're sprinkled on top  so the vegetables' flavors will seep into the rice rolls btw  if you come here after looking at the owner's instagram  don't be fooled  he often posts food that he's eating  not necessarily the rice rolls he's actually cooking   kinda funny if you think about it 
love their freshly made steam rice noodle!!! it was the perfect breakfast on a saturday morning  this place is semi a hole in the wall located inside this mini mall with other shops around  you can't miss it though since it is the first thing you see on the left side when you go inside  soft  smooth  silky  tasty  flavorful  i can find more adjectives to describe their noodles but you get my point heheyou can choose your choice of meat and veggies to go with the rice noodle and wala you get the most amazing taste inside your mouth  i could have this everyday if i live in flushing!they pour soy sauce in the plate of noodle  but it wasn't enough for me  so i added more to drench the noodles just the way i like it  the soy sauce is soaked up by the noodle so quickly that i needed more hehe and i love that their soy sauce is not that salty they have coffee and tea here as well  the staff is super nice and friendly  don't be afraid to let them know what you want in your fresh plate of noodle!
good food  it lives up to the hype  the steam rice rolls are delicious  you can choose three ingredients in the roll which i thought was great  i had shrimp rice rolls with sprouts  corn  and green onions  the chinese crepe is also good too 
a+ spot  joe is lovely and makes your order right in front of you  i go for the shrimp and love the textures and flavors of the dish  really filling and an overall great experience every time 
this is the other of the two fresh made to order rice roll places in flushing   this is the better one of the two  although if you just want a simple rice roll with one filling  fu yuan will get that to you for around $2 50   joe's prices start higher  but you get a larger portion and you can add lettuce  corn  bean sprouts  cilantro  and green onion for free   and these add ins make a big difference in the final taste between joe's and fu yuan  i'd choose joe's every time i'm deducting a star because their curry fish balls were pretty bad   for $1  you get four small fish balls   the fish balls were luke warm and the curry flavor was minimal   i wouldn't order them again 
great place for fresh rice rolls  they've expanded since the first time i've been there  i always get a large beef with scallions  you can add an egg for an extra $1 but i opt out since i'm not a fan  the workers speak english and understand english which is great  not sure if it's cash only  they have stools for you to sit and eat at the location facing the display  it's a little expensive in my opinion ($6 beef large rolls) but it's pretty tasty and soft  i would recommend this place to everyone to try at least once  they make coffee and chinese crepes now  i'll try those on my next visit 
whenever i come here (which is probably once a week)  i always leave satisfied  service is quick and fast  great when you're on a time crunch  there's a few stools for you to sit on (about 8) but it gets pretty crazy around rush hour (12pm and 5 6pm)  turnover rate is quick though  so if you want to sit and eat  just simply wait  i've tried their curry fishball and rice noodles but this one is a bit salty  their beef rolls are my absolute favorite  other than getting a bit more toppings  there's not much difference between small or large  so i usually go with the small  i've seen them do crepes before but have yet to try it  store hours are  monday  11 30am   7 30pmtuesday   sunday  8 30am   7 30pm
this is probably the best place to get steam rice rolls in flushing! the shop itself is pretty small and it shares a space with a couple of different stores  so it's kinda hard to miss sometimes  you can customize what you want in your rice rolls by selecting a protein first  then up to three toppings and additional more for $ 50  they let you add an egg to it as well which i think is the game changer! and lastly  they top everything off with soy sauce and sesame seed! the reason why i love this place so much is because everything is made on the spot and it's super fresh  the large is $6 but honestly that itself is really super filling! they also have savory glutinous rice balls  which they also make on their own  they have soy milk and tea egg as well  in the case you don't want to customize your own rice rolls  they have a bunch of preset items on the menu  they even have fishball with peanut butter sauce!!!!! overall  i highly recommend this place especially for breakfast or an early lunch  i believe they close pretty early or until they're out of everything 
there were 2 ladies on line only when i stepped inside  but soon the place was packed within minutes  this old lady cut the line    whatever  it's too cramped to argue i ordered a small shrimp rice roll with corn and cilantro as well as a chinese crepe with sausage  i had no idea sausage meant hot dog  but perhaps that was the right "meat" to choose since literally everyone before and after me chose "sausage " we were able to find seats at least  since it was raining that day  might as well eat inside  you can see everything that's going on which is actually nice  all the rice rolls are made fresh unlike that other place nearby  these rolls are so soft  delicate  and delicious! i really like how thin the rolls were  the shrimp was fresh  the corn added sweetness  $4 50 for a small isn't too pricey considering that it has shrimp  the soy sauce is not that salty and that's all i needed to enjoy them  i definitely should've tried this place sooner  it's the best rice roll i've had  these probably would've been good eaten cold as well but i can't say the same for the other place  theirs gets so hard   their chinese crepe is pretty good  compared to a few i've tried in flushing  it was a bit difficult to cut up without a knife  i'd suggest you eat it wrapped up instead of it sitting on the plate  they add sesame  lettuce  scallions if you want  the hot dog added a bit of saltiness  otherwise it's a bit plain  meat is $1 extra  crepe is $4  cash only  would've ordered more if they used cards  we thought it was kinda funny that after the crowd was gone  they had a quick lunch break of mcdonalds  i'd rather eat freshly made rice rolls instead of highly processed food!
i might be addicted  i had a hard time wrapping my head around the idea of putting lettuce and corn in steamed rice rolls  but i will eat it any which way now  it  is  all  good  i like my rice rolls plain  which only comes in one size  i don't need no curry fish balls or beef or pork or shrimp  and dare i say it  not even an egg  they just cloud what i really want    pure  glossy  carby  slippery smooth  thin sheets of rice in sweet soy sauce  heck  they don't even need to roll it up  it will enter my mouth just the same i hope they become more than just a stall  i can imagine an entire sit down restaurant for just rice rolls  if it can be done for thai hainanese chicken in elmhurst (eim khao mun kai)  then why not for every mouth watering delight?
my partner and i came to joe's steamed rice rolls on one scorching july afternoon  and i loved  loved it  i got the large steamed rice rolls with eggs and shrimp  if i recall correctly  i remember feeling amazed at the silky  soft texture of these dishes and how the accompanying soy sauce made that more prominent on my tongue  there are only several stool seats at the front counter for eating in  but if you can snag one  it's worth staying and watching how the staff workers here make your rice rolls  it's one of my favorite dim sum dishes  so i jumped at the opportunity to get a jumbo version of them here 
for a small shop they make they food fast and right in front of you  the rice rolls were pipping hot when ready and it's just mesmerizing to watch them make it so quick and easily  affordable and simple  beef steam rice roll was good my favorite is the curry fish ball rice roll with peanut sauce if you get the large it's just more of the toppings  the rice roll portion is the same as the small seating is limited 
impressive    i have been eating steam rice rolls since i was able to walk as a child in hong kong   that is roughly half a century  this place is legit   they use stones to grind the rices into liquids to steam them into pasta   it is smooth   i like bbq porks   the shrimp is good as well   i like the old fashioned style with pasta and protein only   the sauce mixture is good this place is excellent   be here or be square!
1  watch them make the steam rice rolls  it all happens on a large tray that they steam with all your ingredients  totally fascinating 2  order the fresh shrimp steam rice rolls  the small is actually largely sized 3  douse it with their brown sauce  don't know what this is  but it makes the whole experience even better  light  tasty  delicious 5 stars!!!!!
it's like having the best parts of dim sum easily available! my favorite every time i go to dim sum with my parents is always the steam rice rolls! this place makes it right in front of your eyes in less than 5 minutes! so delicious and affordable!i also ordered the chinese pancake(煎饼果子） from here as well! fast and friendly service great price vegetarian options available
i went to nyc for a trip  and stumbled here while walking around with a friend    went in  and they made my order fresh and by far  the best steam rice rolls i've ever had in the us! the owner was crazy funny  and super nice! he even laughed at me for taking pictures of the steam rice rolls before i started eating it    haha! i'll definitely go back when i'm in nyc!
i like this place to pieces! i used to work in the chinatown area where i first discovered fresh steamed rice rolls in the little carts you'd find on the corner of elizabeth or bowery   i miss these so much since moving to the west coast! they were relatively inexpensive and a staple in the community! it was such a pleasant surprise when joe's opened in flushing offering the same feeling of comfort in an expanded way! the sizes are hugeeee and the options are plentiful with choices for beef  pork  bbq pork  shrimp  curry fish balls etc    and a variety of toppings to choose from like cilantro  corn  scallions  bean sprouts  egg (extra)  and sauces (soy sauce and peanut sauce is where it's at!)  you can even add curry fish balls to your order (4 for $1)  it's nice that the menu has both english and chinese (in a very organized and concise manner) so consumers can order with ease  this is literally one of my favorite things to eat and i'm so glad it's reaching a wider audience!  there really is nothing like actual fresh steam rolls and it's hard to find good places  joe's does a tremendous job with service and quality  you see the staff making your order and it's definitely a treat! now  when i come back from the west coast  i have to get some! i won't soon forget the street carts that provided a lot of the breakfasts i consumed when working in manhattan  but joe's is an awesome awesome addition to the flushing community and i'm glad queens has an excellent fresh steam roll place to boast about!
talk about cheap eats!!i mean  yes! where better than flushing  queens to get yourself some fresh and tasty dirt cheap great eats? nowhere  the answer to that is nowhere joes steam rice roll has been in my saved photos of "places i need to go to" and it has finally been checked off  and boy am i glad that i went  they did not disappoint i've always gotten the steam rice rolls at dim sum restaurants  it's one of my favorite things to order  so you can imagine my excitement when i discovered that there was a spot specifically for the rice rolls  uber excited any way you have about 8 options with a choice of 5 free veggie add ins  i ordered the beef & the bbq pork  both small orders which  have you  are pretty big! it's $4 for a small and $6 for the large  i added bean sprouts and scallions  they were both so damn good i wanted more but needed to contain myself i'm drooling just writing this post  and you know what   i might just go back there today like now   see you in an hour !
i love the dim sum version  and joe's does it better! the made to order steamed rice rolls are tasty and fresh with your choice of protein  egg  and two vegetable fillings  i've tried the bbq pork and shrimp versions  and both were very flavorful  however  i'd recommend the bean sprouts and cilantro as the choice of veggies for a tastier filling   it seems that even though scallions is an option  there were already scallions in them as default  i also tried the chinese crepe with sausage (aka jian bing)  and it was also good  probably one of the better ones i've had in ny!seating is tight and limited but people eat quickly and my friends and i were able to grab a spot at the counter after only a few minutes  i'd imagine this place getting super busy during peak lunch hours 
must try if you are in the area! my slippery boyfriend & i split the large shrimp rice roll with corn  scallion  & cilantro (you can pick your own 3 fillings)  added egg & topped with sesame seeds & a side of chili oilsoooooooo good  you can see the sign for this place on the street next to the bank  but is actually part of a c small market shopping area  there are only 5 seats at the bar along the front of the kitchen where the rolls are made fresh right in front of you super quick & yummythe people working there were really friendly definitely coming back
this place is amazing! i've had a lot of rice rolls  and this is pretty much as good as it can get  ordering was super complicated in a good way because you have a lot of choices   first you pick something off the menu (pretty much what meat you would like)  and then you pick what you want to go inside it  and then the sauces as well  we got bbq pork added with egg  and then we got it with corn  green onion  and bean sprouts  for sauces we got the normal soy sauce  peanut sauce on the side  as well as chili oil  it was delicious  the steamed rice rolls were so fresh and so good! it was $7 including tax  which is definitely a great deal  delicious  delicious  delicious; highly recommend![side note  this is my 1700th yelp review!]
fresh rice rolls!! the rice rolls are made as the orders are put in   it's quite amazing just to watch the rice rolls being made   i'm glad you can watch them make it  so you know that you're getting the freshest and cleanest ingredients  many of the choices are about $3 for a small and $6 for a large   i would say a large hits the spot but then your left wanting just a little more   i ordered the beef rice roll (large) and it was the freshest rice roll i have ever eaten   the large rice roll comes with 3 choices of vegetables  i chose corn and scallions i'm not sure how this place is like if it were busy  might be a long wait?  it appears they only have one rice roll maker   i came here when the shop was completely empty and my order was made in less than 5 minutes   i would definitely come back here the next time i'm in the area or whenever i'm craving rice rolls 
dim dum rice rolls will never be the same! i came here this morning to pick up an order before leaving ny and heading back to ca  i've been wanting to come here for the longest time and finally got to try it on our last day here  i saw a video on youtube featuring joe's and i wish i came here earlier this week! i got to watch the lady make the rice mixture on their special mill while the guy made my rice roll order  i ordered the bbq pork steamed rice roll with added egg ($1) and veggies (bean sprouts and scallion   free)  it was so fun and interesting to watch the process of making the rice rolls  i loved how thin the roll was; dim sum ones are always too thick for the amount of filling or too thin and rip fall apart  joe's were perfect  i liked the added egg and bean sprouts too! they also give you the side of sauce to pour over (i took it to go)  make sure you check out joe's when you're in flushing! it's located across the street from the new world mall inside a store with more stores stalls inside  labeled "mio" on the overhang  i couldn't find it for the longest time!
oh  the steam rice roll  these are my absolute favorite at dim sum  and when i heard there is a vendor that makes only these  i had to see it for myself! this small stand is located in the miolife black awning directly across from the new world mall entrance  there is an electric sign flashing "open" to let you know they are there  i heard that the store hours had recently changed  they are open at 11 30am now  today i stopped by around 2pm  not crowded at all for lunch time  some of the orders were taken to go  and well packed in plastic tupperwares and plastic bags  they take your orders quickly and the wait is not bad  i ordered the pork rice roll (large $6  small $4) which came with a choice of 3 free vegetable toppings aka filling (corn  cilantro  lettuce  bean sprouts  or parsley) and an optional egg for a dollar extra  sesame seeds as a topping are optional and free  there are no tables  just a bar eating area that has enough seats for about 8 patrons  since the vendor is located right by the door  it can get chilly as people enter and exit  and also you might feel you are in the way as deliveries are wheeled in on a handtruck (i had to move from my seat twice today so the guy could wheel the heavy packages out) i ordered in english but did not realize the guy was calling my order in cantonese   lol  he noticed me looking up from my seat and asked me if i ordered the pork  "yes " i said  and he passed me my plate smiling  it was a good snack to tide over my hunger  the rice rolls were so soft and thin  still piping hot from being steamed  everything tasted super fresh  the lettuce still had a good crunch to it  the corn was sweet and plump  not stale or hard  it was delicious! too bad i spotted the container of sweet soy sauce too late  i would have drowned my rolls in it! they also have vinegar  and sriracha sauce on the counter if you need it  i can't wait to try everything on the menu here! i was fascinated by the process of making the steam roll; the guy who does it is so efficient  now i can have steamed rice rolls anytime (not limited to dim sum time) to my heart's content! i took a star away because there isn't much seating and this type of food does not taste as good if it isn't eaten right away  i would use the "take out" option if there were a place i could sit down and enjoy my food (park bench somewhere?) also  i am not sure if this building the vendor is located in has its own restroom 
on christmas eve  called ahead to pick up! wow! great service  ready when i arrived  pancakes was the best  flakey  crisp dough  we got 1 with sausage but it was actually a hot dog  not good  would've preferred lop chun (chinese sausage)  plain was very good  now to the rice rolls  we got shrimp  pork and fish balls with curry sauce  the shrimps (25 30?!)were large whole pieces  ground pork was pretty good as well  added cilantro and bean sprouts to both  made a big difference on taste and texture  added a nice crunch  the curry fish balls had a good amount of curry flavor unlike other places i've had  all were large size  great deal for the portion  will definitely be back  very nice friendly people 
different than what i'm used to  but there is absolutely nothing wrong with freshly made steamed rice rolls  came here ordered the beef and egg with scallions and was so happy that the food options in flushing are increasing in their options and diversity ( as far as chinese food is concerned ) enjoyed the freshness and how soft the rolls are  and the flavor of all the add ons in the rolls  would definitely come back here would personally like to see the rolls a little thicker maybe more add on option
the food here is amazing  ordered the shrimp rice roll  beef rice roll  chinese pancake with sausage  and soybean milk  my favorite was the chinese pancake   the combination of ingredients and sauces was delicious  plus the soybean milk here tasted very authentic  highly recommend 
this is as close as it can get to the steam rice rolls i've had in hong kong  they make it on the spot for you  the store is very small inside a small plaza so you might miss it  the process of making rice rolls always impresses me  i love the peanut butter sauce they have and the rice rolls are so chewy and delicious 
absolutely delicious  one of the best steamed rolls i've ever had  if not the best  while there's only a few meat options to choose from  there's a ton of combinations you can creat  the meat options include pork  roast pork  beef  and shrimp  they also have a plain option  then you get to choose 3 of the 5 different veggie add ons for free  you can also add an egg for an extra $1   they have a large and small option  the difference is the amount of meat you get with it  they also make a pretty good curry fish ball   each order comes this soy sauce and peanut sauce on the side the prices are too bad about $6 for large and $4 for a small   there's a few chairs there if you want to eat the rolls fresh from the steamer  otherwise with the container provided you can easily eat it on to go overall  great prices  great steamed rolls   definitely recommend it if you're looking for a quick cheap breakfast or lunch!!!
learned about the store on instagram and all the pictures posted about them  made my sister and i visit the place for the first time a few weeks ago they have different types of steam rice rolls and you can add corn and meat for extra costs once you order you can see them make the rolls and it's always interesting to watch when we went the place was packed with people eating  the place is located in small little place on roosevelt ave in flushing  definitely one of the best rice rolls i have ever tasted  the skin was nice and thin as it's hard finding places that make them that thin  normally it would be pretty thick with little fillings  the proportion was just right and the flavor of the rolls are pretty mellow  which is great because i personally don't like it when it gets too salty  but of course if you are the ones that like more flavor  they do give you soy sauce on the side  so dip away~
rice roll craving? joe's your guy! compared to the other places i've been too  i believe the quality is better  it's thinner which i prefer and you get a choice of 3 free veggies and $1 more for egg if you want  you can't go wrong with the curry fishball rice roll! i took a star off because of the seating it's not ideal  they are the first stall right next to the entrance  i went during winter so anytime they opened the door i felt the cold air  other than that food is bomb 
absolutely love it here  it's freshly made and quick  the ingredients they use are fresh! in and out in about 10 minutes or so  there's limited seating  my sauce sauce is their peanut and hosin sauce 
i came here because a couple ny friends told me about their rice roll   i like how it's right there nad you can watch them make it   another thing i like is that we can choose up to 3 veggies to put inside  which is awesome! the steam rice roll place in la i always go to doesn't have that option  (anyways  the steam rice rolls were pretty good  i do admit that i've had better  but it still is good (don't get me wrong)   the rice rolls came out quick and there is a condiment place if you want to add some spice or extra soy sauce!
freshly made steam rice rolls  can be regarded as noodles to the chinese community  amazingly delicious yet affordable  great dish for breakfast  lunch and dinner  great job joe! keep up the good work  wish you can have seating for more people    hopefully soon you will be able to have your own space! looking forward to it!
the competition for cantonese rice rolls in flushing just got even hotter  the crown for best steamed rice rolls in flushing has been placed on joe's head food  i tried to order as much as i possibly could to try everything  as it has been said repeatedly  happy wife  happy life  and we both found that joe's was the best experience for steamed rice rolls we've ever had in the entire city of new york  yes  this includes lots of places in manhattan's chinatown  brooklyn's chinatown  and downtown flushing  yes  i am aware of the immensity of this statement  the thin layers of rice roll wrapped in nearly perfectly crafted ingredients makes this space truly remarkable service  the guy behind the counter actually working on the food is a cantonese speaker who happens to have hired staff who speak mandarin only  i had to choose my language channels repeatedly  but it got the job done decor  this is a food stand within a space that has a coffee shop  general seating  and some clothing retailer  i shall return 
few seating available  most people order to go  a bit over priced in my opinion  but the steam rice rolls are amazing  usually a line in the weekend  but the wait is not too bad  two toppings of your choice are included in your order 
can't believe i never wrote a review for this! i was so happy to see another rice roll place pop up in flushing  it's located inside a "shopping" alley (? not quite a center)  more like a cluster of food vendors and clothes retailers  you see therm add all the ingredients in front of you and pour the liquid mixture on the flat pan  into the steamer  add egg! (best tip of the day)i waited a really long time for my order  which is the only complaint i have  but there's only one person steaming so who can blame them?the wait is worth it! ask for the peanut sauce along with the soy sauce! there are only a few seats here but you can take it to go and sit at the new world mall food court across the street (but don't tell them i told you    or at least buy something from there first!)
yoooo this place is a steal!great price for a lot of good foooooodi recommend getting the large (it's the same size as med small but more meat inside)i got the bbq pork and shrimp which were greatit's also just really cool watching them make the rice rollsfor 10 bucks you can fill up easily  delicious  make sure you ask for some hot sauce   chili oil on the side
i was mad hyped for the actual food but was disappointed by how crappy the shrimp is  the shrimp from corner 28 dimsum is better than this  the shrimp they use is the frozen ones you buy from the supermarket  doesn't taste fresh and juicy when you eat it  been wanting to come here for a while but they are never open early!!! i work in flushing & churngfunis a breakfast y food for me  and they are never open early enough before work for me to get it  yes i can try after work but i don't crave it for dinner   i feel like they would have a lot more business if they opened earlier for breakfast  overall would not get this again  yes the quality is better than most places in flushing  its made to order and it is fun to watch them make it   but i think the reviews on yelp are a bit generous 
it's interesting to witness how steamed rice rolls have evolved since i was little  i used to pay $1 for plain rice rolls with peanut sauce and a couple dollars more for fancier versions during dim sum weekends  now  both versions are easily accessible whether through street vendors or a small booth like joe's the booth is situated in a boutique mall on roosevelt ave   right by the entrance  seating is limited as they only have 3 bar stools arranged before counter space that is too narrow to hold their serving plates of choice  however  it is nice sitting there and observing them while they throw your 3 free vegetable selections and choice of ground meat onto the flat steaming pan   we ordered a small beef roll with scallions and lettuce  a small pork roll with bean sprouts  lettuce and cilantro  2 orders of curry fish balls and a pancake with crab meat  for a small $4 roll  they give quite a lot! more importantly  they were made to order and extremely silky and fresh  the free vegetables surprisingly amped up the rice rolls a lot more than expected   i would advise adding bean sprouts for added texture in your bites and scallions and cilantro for aroma on a bad note  i thought the curried fish balls were mediocre  not spicy at all and the sauce not thick enough to coat each ball   the pancake was blah  very greasy and no wow factor   stop by for the rice rolls and rice rolls only!
the place is a tiny shop inside of a store  it's basically the cashier and three stools at a small counter  think you are better off eating it at home  the rolls seem expensive at first but the rolls are pretty large so the price isn't terrible  i ordered the small shrimp and it was $4 50 the food shrimp steam rice roll with egg  scallion and corn  overall  i thought this was just ok  i felt like everything was rather bland  the dough itself was nice and light  but the flavors of the ingredients didn't really do it for me  the corn was a mistake since it really just tasted like corn straight out of the can  there was nothing added to the corn at all  the scallions were a non factor  the shrimp didn't really have any flavor and the egg tasted like how steamed egg would taste  this is nothing like the steamed rice rolls you get from any respectable dim sum restaurant  also  i asked for hot oil on the side  the hot oil packs a punch  yelp com user_local_phot…
it's rare to find a place that will make plain cheung fun (rice rolls ) plain as in the quality of the cheung fun better be damn good   soft  fresh  slight chew and doesn't leave a funky aftertaste (lots of refrigerated rice noodles do ) this has been one of the very few places that makes it hk style   plain  sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds  sweet soy and peanut butter sauce on the side  they'll even toss in a small bamboo skewer like the way it's served in hk street vendors  it's cool to see they have a rice grinder and make the batter fresh  really interesting to see how it's made and quickly assembled  i just wish they made 'zha leung'   rice roll wrapped around a fresh chinese cruller occasionally found (and botched) in dim sum places 
always walked by this spot but never realized they had such tasty food here! it's conveniently located right by the subway stations on main street  flushing there are a variety of different steam rice rolls available with the option of having lettuce  corn  bean sprout  scallion  cilantro and egg in it  i had ordered the dried shrimp with lettuce  cilantro  scallion and egg  the rice roll was very soft and thin  which was very delicious  i had opted for the combo of peanut sauce and soy sauce for the dressing highly recommended!
what a treat  i've been eating rice noodle rolls practically since i came out of my momma's womb and i've never had them like this  fresh made to order thin rolls with custom toppings   ingenious!you gotta watch them make these glorious thin rolls   they pour the batter and your selected ingredients onto a sheet pan and it gets gently steamed into a rice noodle  the way they work the batter and form it into noodles is mesmerizing  a beautiful process to witness!they're glutinous  soft  squishy  and flavorful  just like you'd expect them to be ordered mine with beef  egg  and scallions  the egg wasn't really necessary unlike some other reviewers suggested  but definitely opt for a good protein of your choice and scallions  definitely getting in on the corn next time too!i should also mention as a non mandarin speaker  i was grateful for english speaking employees  not always the case in flushing unfortunately these bad boys are dangerously good  so good i'm kinda glad i'm from jersey  eat more rolls  gain more rolls  is it worth it you ask? hell yes! go to joe's!
i am deep in love with this steamed rice roll! i have digestion problem  so recently i was exploring a light  gluten free but still nutritious snack  when i tried for the first time  it just melted in my mouth and smoothly digested  so i felt great after i ate  i chose shrimp  sprouts  cilantro as toppings  veggie toppings are complementary  the seating was limited and little uncomfortable  so keep in mind when you bring somebody with you  hope this place gets popular soon and expand to a bigger place! the owner speaks in chinese mostly but he seemed like a good person 
small little strip in a larger store on main street  there are a couple stools for people who want to stay but it does get a little cramped so i recommend having it to go  there's a menu of the different rice rolls on the tv (no menus to go yet)  you select the main filling (pork  beef  bbq pork  curry fish ball  dried shrimp  shrimp  or just plain rice roll  then  you have the vegetable options  corn  lettuce  bean sprouts  cilantro  and scallion  they give you three vegetable options for free  i opted for the beef rice roll with corn  cilantro  and scallions  they make it right in front of you so that was exciting to watch  there was a good portion of beef and veggies in the rice roll  most places skimp out and only put a couple pieces of meat but this place definitely gives more  it's a pretty solid taste  would definitely recommend to coworkers who are craving some churng fun!
there aren't too many places that make steamed rice rolls in front of you  i thoroughly enjoyed this place because you get to pick your meats and even additional vegetable toppings! service was fantastic   both a guy (the cook) and a girl were very friendly and checked in from time to time  there were only four chairs and a small narrow table to eat on  but for a quick snack it's not a big deal  the portion is huge  a small for $4 isn't bad when the roll is deliciius  fresh and generous  it's placed on a plate so presentation is better than those places that throw them into a plastic box  which winds up making the food look all mushy and gross   i liked the soft yet non gooey texture of the steamed rolls  and the beef had great flavor with the addition of eggs  scallions  and corn  we also got the dried shrimp  which in my opinion lacked a bit of flavor  the beef one won this one! come if you want a quick cheap snack!
yooo    joe's steam rice rolls is mad lit  i'm so glad i discovered this place from yelp! i was really hungry this morning and i just happened to be in the vicinity  the exterior of the place is not really appealing  but good rice rolls invite a steady stream of business  when i try new places  i like to start with basics first i ordered a plain rice roll w  corn  scallions  cilantro  and bean sprouts  i really like the texture of the rice rolls! it's glutinous  soft & squishy (hehe)  embedded with veggies   drizzled with sesame & soy sauce  and piping hot and fresh from the rice roll making machine  there was this warm homemade feeling  i got it in size s  which was already filling enough for me  i wish there was some peanut sauce  and hoisin oyster sauce  the flavor was pretty basic(basically like eating glutinous rice)  and i really enjoy the "biting" flavor of the soy sauce  customer service does not affect this review  but i felt it was rude when the lady(prolly the boss) was like  in a low voice  "don't give too much topping  " in mandarin right in front of me  wtf? i can understand mandarin lmao  vegetables are not that expensive  especially in flushing  *rolls eyes* train your employee behind the scenes  not when your potential loyal customer is right in front of you  overall  i really  really  really  enjoyed my rice roll  especially the texture  i've enjoyed the rice rolls at fu yuan(around the corner from coco's)  but i always thought it was sort of lacking  the answer was in the texture 
this place is amazing  i'm so glad it's located in the heart of flushing  not gonna lie  according to the address here it was a little hard for me to find at first because it pointed me to a office building  after staring at the building for about 5 minutes i looked to my right and there it was! the place looks very small on the outside but the inside is not bad  there were about 3 people working  one in which i believe is the owner  the lady that helped me was very friendly and spoke great english  basically you choose the type of meat you want (pork  beef  bbq pork  curry fish ball  dried shrimp  (you can also get it without meat)) and then 3 side ingredients from the 5 (corn  lettuce  bean sprouts  cilantro  and scallions) and then you have the option to add an egg in there for $1 more  there is a large option for $6 and small for $4  i went with the large because that's the way to go  you can also watch your rolls being made which i thought was quite mesmerizing  5 minutes later  i was presented with delicious rice rolls  i honestly didn't think i would be able to finish the whole thing but i devoured it in like 47 seconds  it was delicious! i plan to come here again and again   will recommend!
growing up eating rice rolls from street carts  rice rolls have become a staple of my snack diet there is now a place that makes fresh rolls  and you can add whatever toppings you want $4 for a small  $6 for a large   toppings included in the price are scallions  corn  cilantro i usually just get the classic dried shrimp with scallions takes about 5 minutes or so per order if there's no other orders ahead of you   you can watch the chef in action spreading the liquid rice mixture into the steamer and sprinkle your requested toppings small seating area in the middle of the mini mall 
joe's rice rolls are quite unique as i have never had them with corn and scallion before  it's also made fresh to order and the batter for your rice roll plus toppings are poured and mixed together in the steamer  i came here right when they opened sunday morning and really wanted to try the curry fish ball rice roll but unfortunately  they didn't have any fish ball so i ended up getting the beef rice roll and opted for the corn and scallion toppings that everyone gets with no egg tho  regular soy sauce (not the sweet kind) and hot sauce were given but next time i have to remember to ask for extra hot sauce  the rice roll was smooth and tasted pretty good  i actually prefer this kind over the ones with the peanut sauce  the staff here are very friendly and answer any questions you may have about their rice rolls  definitely going back soon to try the other flavors and toppings they offer with an egg this time and the curry fish ball that i didn't get to try last time 
** 3 5 stars **freshly steamed cantonese rice rolls are one of my favorite foods  and it takes some looking around to find places in new york city that do it  and i'm still looking for one that can come close to places in the gta in canada  which are good enough to spur regular family trips just to eat  or just proof of how dear this humble food is to us joe's is one of the street side vendors in a small indoor mall  across the street from the roosevelt avenue entrance to new world mall   their specialty are cantonese rice rolls  the rice ground in a stone mill  the batter poured out on a metal tray and steamed   those rolls make up the majority of the menu  which includes curry fish balls  tea eggs  and chinese pancakes assemble the rice roll order by choosing from the following   size  medium or large (latter fills up a standard 9 inch styrofoam plate)  main filling  shrimp  beef  pork  bbq pork  curry fish ball  dried shrimp (or plain  one size only)  additional fillings  corn  lettuce  scallions  bean sprouts  cilantro  egg ($1 extra)  optional sauces  soy  hot saucemade to order  they'll come hot   the rolls are very thin and wrinkled in appearance   mouthfeel is smooth  with quite a bit more chew than expected   the flavor is bland  with less of a rice aroma than might also be expected considering the rice is milled on site   sauces are needed   the fillings are serviceable but they don't make or break the experience   while these can be taken to go  they're best consumed right after being steamed  and some shared tables are available a few steps further into the mall to have them on while joe's rice rolls are much better than average rice rolls available from many a dim sum parlor  they are perplexingly forgettable  somehow just a bit too bland  a bit too chewy  and not silky enough   still worth a trip because of their freshness  and i will likely be back to sate an occasional rice roll craving 
this place is amazing  i heard that he spent three days figuring out the perfect rice to water ratio and oh boy was it worth it  the staff are friendly and the cheung fin is divine  you will never be disapponted
fresh rice rolls made in front of you   fast  efficient service within a shopping alley in flushing   the rice rolls were good  as they were hot and good tasting for 3 of them for $5 (including $1 egg) my only concern was that there was only a small amount of dried shrimp and i can only barely taste it   plus  the price is a bit higher than other places that serve the same thing   but overall  i would maybe come back again for their fresh rice rolls 
located in flushing across from macys on roosevelt ave   i have been seeing pictures of joe's steamed rice roll on my instagram feeds and on my yelp feeds   i just had to have it!  the store front is tiny and it's shared with other business in a mall   they do have a sit down spot inside for to stay diners  the process of making these is actually quite beautiful   they pour rice flour mix into a giant steaming pan and they mix all of your ingredients in   i ordered beef  corn and egg which came out to $7 (4 for steam rice roll  2 for the beef  1 for the egg and corn was free)the pan goes into an industrial steaming unit and in about 3 4 minutes they pop it out and roll and cut it up for you   the rice roll is silky smooth  maybe the silkiest i've ever had  everything was pretty good in terms of quality   i still prefer the fishball steamed rice noodles with peanut sauce from other places over this if i had to choose a type of steamed rice rolls   the soy sauce is not sweet like the dim sum soy sauce either  nothing wrong with that but i expected a sweetness to it   i also feel like the egg can be skipped   it doesnt really add anything to the flavor   i would like to try the pork liver next time  that just sounds weird and i love bizarre type foods  overall a good meal and worth a try 
after reading my friend rich w's review  i had it bookmarked and decided come here tonight  i was rushing from the train station because this spot closes at 7pm says yelp  i ordered a large beef rice roll   he informed me that toppings are free   i choose corn and scallions and he suggested adding an egg which is definitely quite unique  i recorded videos of him working his magic making these delectable rice rolls but unfortunately they aren't supported for yelp uploads #bummer!he gave me a little history on the rice roll   it's made with fresh ingredients! awww too cute he offered one of mines piping hot from the steamer but i wanted to enjoy it with my parents  shoot it takes me 25 mins to get via my bus  finally got home and it was semi warmish but tasted pretty yummy  the hot sauce lit my mouth on fire lol definitely affordable for $6 (large) and $1 (egg topping)!follow them on instagram @steamriceroll
joe's is a new stall at this location (mio mall) and makes fresh cantonese style rice rolls they are just like to ones i remember near henry st and market st (sing hing lung) downtown chinatown when i was growing up their style is from the mainland china where the rice roll skin is very thin i tried the large beef rice roll with sesame seed and soy sauce  they didn't offer the heavier sauce or the peanut sauce other places use   rate 4 5 try eating it asap for best taste! there is a seating area directly inside i definitely will be back to try the other rice roll selections 
freshly made right in front of you  i ordered shrimp steam rice rolls large size with add on  eggs and veges all for 6 dollars  diggin bc you'll love it  there could be a line but it's worth the wait  joe  the owner  prepped and cooked my order  it's so delicious!!! come and try it!
the rice rolls are cooked fresh on demand  and it is quite tasty when you add the soy sauce  sesame seed  and white pepper  i like the rice roll with shrimp  egg  and various vegetables 
the steam rice rolls are very smooth  you have a choice of fillings  shrimp  beef  pork  fish balls  veggies   sprouts  scallion  cilantro  lettuce  corn can be added into the rolls   limit of 3   they offer soy sauce and not sauce on the side  you can eat at the counter or to go  small and lace but good food!  they have a crepe pancake place next to it   not sure who runs it  the staff speak mandarin but if you order from the menu  you will be okay
lead by my yelper friends i arrived at joe's steam rice rolls for a late lunch at around 2pm and was glad i did  there was hardly a line  ordering was super easy  you pick your toppings which include shrimps  beef and barbecue pork  i asked joe the owner what the difference between small and large size were and he said that the toppings were larger in the large size  but the rice rolls were the same size  for example  for the shrimps the small size has only 5 shrimps  and the large  10 shrimps  you have choices of 3 vegetable toppings which include scallion  cilantro  lettuce and corn  extras include eggs and pork threads  sesame seeds were a free offer   as hungry as i was i ordered two small sizes of shrimp & bbq pork toppings  the orders took awhile to be ready but that was because they made everything freshly in front of you  the rice cake is served with tangy soy sauce  and you can also add chili paste or chili oil  i went with the chili oil that added a nice nutty flavor  the rice cake itself was a little bit softer than the vietnamese version that i'm used to  nonetheless it was still very enjoyable  the two small orders were large enough to satisfy my hunger and the damage was only $8  will i come back? you betcha!
quick snack bite   no line on a sunday afternoon at 3ishpm   ordered for takeout cause appparently parking is close to impossible   fresh indeed rice rolls however but lost on its flavoring sauces    good texture on their rice rolls and fresh ingredients in additions   however their sauces were all in disappointment    their soy sauce were too salty when its supposed to be somewhat sweet    it literally numbed my lips   we ordered the rice rolls were special sauce (peanut butter sauce and hosien sauce)   there was no balance in the sauce and only tasted peanut butter and less hoisen even adding their soy sauce did no justice to its taste   no good sauce no good rice rolls   probably will not go out the way to have it again 
the texture is amazing  i love a rice roll that's thin and yet silky  when you bite into it  there's a little chew  that's exactly what its like here  i took out one star because the sauce that came with the rolls weren't right  i'm used to the sweet soy sauce that's served in dim sum rice rolls  their sauce tasted more like the clay pot rice sauce  more salty  if they can get the soy sauce right  i'll update this review 
joe is extremely hospitable! these were the best cheong fun i have ever eaten  the texture is just right  i recommend the peanut sauce with cheong fun  i don't even care for the meat  the noodles are that great! next time i'm in flushing again  i'm definitely going to visit this place again!
had an amazing experience with the rice roll  i tried the beef rice roll with corn  lettuce and bean sprout! you have to add the egg! the curry ball was a let down thou!
very nice food presentation and the price is just right for the quality ingredients  i spent $22 lunch for 3 person  it is hard to get a seat 
so yes  $4 50 for a "small" portion of this is blasphemous in flushing  but the quality of the rice roll (so soft and fresh) and the ingredients (plump  fresh shrimp and fresh herbs and veg)  not to mention each one is made to order  makes this a $4 50 very well spent  wasnt too crowded late on a sunday morning and order was ready within 5 10 min  there are no tables to eat at though  so be prepared to stand walk and eat 
tasty authentic steam rolls here! i got the large pork steam roll with egg  they give you a generous helping and i was pretty full  the egg and free toppings definitely make the steam rolls tastier so pile up  i waited about 5 7 minutes which wasn't too bad  it was cool watching them make the rolls in front of you 
the noodles tasted good but the shrimp was not deveined and did not taste fresh   i ordered a large and paid $6 50 so i was a bit surprised at how small the order turned out to be (comparable to a typical dim sum order)
i'm in the area frequently and i love getting quick  cheap food from here  i know there's many places in the area that can cater to plant based diets but the language barrier sometimes makes it difficult to be completely sure of what's in my food  this isn't the case with joe's steam rice rolls  i get the plain rice rolls with bean sprouts  cilantro  and lettuce  the food is made right in front of you and doesn't take long  they offer soy sauce on the side or a peanut butter sauce  a great deal for $3!
it's better than i expected   i ordered a large size of beef with corn and cilantro   i really enjoyed it   i could eat another one but i decided to make it two large to go orders instead   i think the texture tastes better when it's slightly cold   also  the to go boxes are not those small white plastic pint or quart containers  they are the plastic rectangular containers  so there's plenty of room the rice rolls won't stick it together   friendly staff and i think they are the family members and take term to run the place  there are no tables at all   only three high stools by the cashier 
3 5cheap  but not enough meat      i only saw like 3 pieces of meat for the whole bowl  i wish they charge slightly more money and give me more meat  the fish ball is pretty nice and it's just a dollar  basically i spent 5 dollars for 2 adults so it's a good deal 
great spot to try out for their hk snacks  got the rice roll with corn  lettuce and bean sprouts with beef and liked it  loved their salty dumpling since it came with radish and pork as well (probably my favorite)  it's a little small business and i wouldn't hesitant to come back if i were in flushing again!
this is kind of fast food place  it has a counter where about eight people can sit down and eat  they make the noodles right in front of you  so its really fresh  you pick what meat you want and what vegetables in your steamed rice noodle  add soy sauce  hot sauce or curry whatever you prefer and ready  i liked the pork dumpling with eggs  scallion  bean sprout  cilantro with soy sauce  if you are not in the mood for going to a restaurant  or just want to grab something fast  its a good place to eat in or take out  i will stop by again  if i come to the area 
guangzhou steamed rice noodles! they let you choose the ingredients and they make it in front of you  it's quite interesting to see how they make it and the machine they use  food is absolutely delicious and service is very friendly  they are located at the entrance of a mini shopping mall  there's a few tables and seats towards the middle of the mall but very limited  and they only have one steam machine so orders get really backed up when a crowd shows up 
ok  this place is just great  they imported their own rice mill and steamer to make this one dish to perfection  i could eat this every day  maybe twice a day even!
omg  this is absolutely delicious  reminds me of my childhood when there were a bunch of steam roll carts in chinatown  this place couldn't have shown up at a better time  i could definitely eat these all day  everyday  also the difference between a small and large are the amount of toppings they put in  the amount of noodles are the same  also  if you want the curry fish balls just get the steam rolls with the curry fish balls  so much more worth it!
a great option for a snack breakfast in flushing  i always appreciate it when establishments make the food fresh and in front of you  i went in on a weekday morning  right when they opened  unfortunately they could not supply me with the bbq roast pork version so i ended up getting the regular pork & of course i added an egg  it came out in a few minutes nice and fresh and you have a choice of adding the corn and the fixins  i added some chili oil on top of mine  if i ever need my fix of steam rolls  i'd come here 
they have a pending health inspection grade and the ingredients like shrimp aren't the highest quality  but i'll be damned if it isn't the best and freshest steamed rice rolls i've ever had  on top of that  they're also reasonably priced  really would be great if they found a cleaner kitchen and higher quality ingredients because i would happily pay 50% more for it 
nice place to go for a steamed rice roll breakfast  lunch  or snack  they make your order fresh in front of you  you pick the type  pork  beef  dried shrimp  shrimp  or curry fish ball  add an egg $1 extra  pick 3 vegetable filling like corn  bean sprouts  cilantro  or scallions  there is a small counter with 3 stools to eat in  large order is $6 and small is $4  the shrimp large $6 50 and small is $4 5  can soda and bottled water is $1  one large order is good enough for me  the pork and beef were really good especially if you drizzle a little bit of hot sauce on them  the curry fish ball i would not recommend unless you are a big fan of curry 
fast fresh and cheap  we order 4 plates shrimp stream rice rolls  basically nothing was left off or plate at the end  everything is cook by the order  very lite and yummy 
walking in  first thing to the left is a large pan with a steaming white sheet of rice noodles  to order  i went with the $4 small beef  scallion and sesame on top (accoutrements gratis)   for those who have had dim sum  with this  it is a different animal  usually i would go with supple shrimp over a gray beef blend instead  this beef actually has some meaty flavor  less filling in it  the noodles are the highlight  extremely thing  layered over and over on top of each other  the scallion cuts through the beef and sweetness of the noodles  i would go with a bit of chili oil to offer more complexity to the dish  a great portion for $4 as the large seems like too much  and better for 2 people 
i've been seeing this place on my instagram feed lately and just had to give it a try  i was impressed  it was fresh and made to order  the rice rolls were light and silky and very smooth  went during the evening so only got to try one order  got the bbq pork with cilantro and scallion  wanted to keep it simple  the cook though  said his fave was the beef and egg  so i will be trying that next time 
the rice roll is really tasty  i had a barbecued meat rice roll it's morning  with free corn and lettuce  i never had a rice roll with toppings  it turn out amazing  the mixture is wonderful  price is reasonable  the sever owner is very friendly  i will be sharing this place to my friends and coworkers!
the best part of this place and being able to watch him make it for you from grinding the rice into batter to the actual steaming  only place in flushing where you can see it done  very tasty  light  and fresh steam rice rolls for $4 6 each  i usually get the beef or pork with cilantro  scallion  and sprouts (adds a great crunch)  add an egg for $1 the stall is in a little space w other food and clothing stalls  there is some seating in front of the stall or a few steps around the corner 
joe's served the best cheong fun (腸粉) i've had on this side of the pacific  this is not the dim sum style  where the protein is wrapped in the noodle  but a different style where the toppings are mixed into the noodle batter and steamed together  it's definitely not a winner in the looks department  but lends itself to easy customization the rice "noodle" is paper thin  translucent  and smooth on the tongue  i chose beef as my protein and corn as my only veg (though you can have multiple vegetable toppings)  the noodle is served with a sprinkling of sesame (optional) and soy sauce for dipping  a small portion was $4 and the perfect size for a light lunch  i took my noodle to go  but there's some seating in the back next to one of the stores in this mall  service was friendly and multilingual 
i am a rice noodle roll fanatic  it is a childhood favorite growing up so i try to get them as much as possible  i came here before i knew anthony bourdain decided to make his way over here at joe's steam rice rolls  the rice rolls are made to order and you have different choices of fillings  not the absolute best rice rolls i've had  but definitely worth a try!
the rice rolls are so good  best i ever had  there is something about the rice rolls itself  i have had them twice already  once at the restaurant and once take out  they are chewy and soft all at the same time  there are a variety of toppings and the rice rolls itself are just so tasty  they aren't too thick  service is exceptional as well  i love and wish this place was closer to the apartment 
i only find this rice roll place okay  i find it too pricey for what it is  rice rolls  it barely has filling  for $6 7 at joe's  i expected a lot more filling in the rice rolls  i prefer the tiny rice roll place a block over on the other side of main street  where a large is $4 with filling in it too  sorry joe  i find your product expensive for the area and i prefer the hk style street rice rolls and dim sum style too  and i'm sorry the soy sauce was not for me  i like the dim sum style soy sauce better and i like the sauces for hk style fresh rice rolls better too  joe's soy sauce needs to be worked on 
amazingly cheap and tasty  the curry fish balls really take me back to the street food in mongkok hong kong! there are two sizes  regular and large  if you're looking for a satisfying small snack  get the regular and share with someone  for a meal  get the large! there's only a 1$ 2$ difference  and the regular is around 4$  if you want a little sweetness  they offer to put peanut butter sauce on it! there's only a couple seats to sit  so you can take it to go 
joe's steamed rice rolls is the first food stand on the left hand side inside mio mall  i dropped by on a friday night around 630pm and was surprised to hear that there was only enough rice flour for one more roll  while they are technically open until later  joe's uses freshly milled rice slurry to make their rolls using the grinder in the front of the stand and often runs out early  i very happily ordered my rice rolls with pork and scallions and light sauce to go  the prices are a little pricier than i usually pay for rice rolls ($4 for rice roll base  $2 for additional toppings like meat  $1 for eggs  and vegetables for free) but the portions are large  my order filled a large takeout box and was relatively filling  the rolls were silky smooth  the pork fresh and the sauce flavorful  i ate mine quickly when they were still steaming hot but these definitely do not keep well and get gummy when cooled  i didn't see any seating in the area and it was a bit awkward to find somewhere quickly to eat  hopefully with warmer weather  this won't be as big of an issue  (edit  it seems like there is some seating available so keep an eye out!)the staff team at joe's were extremely pleasant to talk to and were knowledgable  accommodating and helpful  they also mentioned that they may be extending their hours to meet the breakfast rush with more offerings available so i will most definitely be returning 
very interesting and entertaining to see them make the rice rolls right in front of you  it is definitely fresh  i still prefer the rice rolls at the dimsum houses because there's more flavor  overall  not bad  not too much stuffing and it's more expensive than the dimsum house 
if you were too walk inside  your eyes will definitely roll around and around trying to take in all the stimuli  in one area you see chinese crepes and steamed rice rolls being made right before your eyes  turn right and you might be looking at a make up cosmetics counter  and further pass the food signage  cute children's lunch boxes on shelves   ignore all but the food area  if you are lucky to snag a seat at the counter  you can enjoy rice rolls made to order  there is small ($4) and large ($6) and your choice meat protein or plain  then again choose three veggies  which get enveloped into the rolls  if you want an egg that is $1 extra  a nice added touch is the sesame seeds and don't forget to have sauce your way too!  never thought lettuce would taste good in my rice roll  but how wrong was i! they cut the rolls for easier eating so each square is a billowy delicious pocket of goodness   lunch time is very busy  so take out might be a good option  the folks here work really hard  the chinese crepe looks good too  can't wait to try it next  some of the folks here speak english very well  so don't be deterred  get in there and get some custom goodness 
the novelty lies in the grinder and since i came later in the evening  it was already retired for the day  staff was very charming and welcoming in a way that's uncommon in flushing when you're an english speaker  but the food was subpar the rice noodles are definitely fresh  fresh in a way that you can taste and smell the rice starch very keenly  which is unfortunate because it's a very raw flavor akin to a freshly opened bag of rice flour  it is neither masked nor improved with the selection of toppings  the variety is like the bubble tea gimmick  add anything and everything whether or not it complements  while i love corn  why wrap grain in grain? on a positive note  the shrimp was fresh  lastly  the sauce tasted like diluted light soy sauce with water like consistency  i don't really have an opinion other than it's palatable and a change from the usual slightly sweeter mixtures ultimately  the grainy albeit fresh noodles accompanied with a frugal smattering of filling was anticlimactic  while not the most exciting  even standard dim sum cheong fun is leagues better  and half the price to boot  really wanted to love this place  but the lovely staff can't comp for expensive and mediocre street food 
the best cantonese rice roll ever! in new york  the cantonese rice noodles and rice roll are always thick and really semitransparent with a strong sauce absorption  joe didn't follow them  he got the point of the best rice proportion  and make the rice skin in a very chinese way  the ingredient of the rice mixture are really orthodox  and tast different from other venders   take a sheet of rice skin with meet or shrimp  steam it for a little  while  a smooth  unsticky  pliable with just a little semitransparent rice roll can be done   if you try once  you will not forget it anymore but i would like to say that the space is pretty limited for seating there  i have to take them back home 
i really like this hole in the wall place  line moves pretty fast  the food is fresh and delicious 
i read about joe's steam rice roll in edible queens  i am glad i looked for this tiny shop! the location is a little mini mall in chinatown with a small counter  my first time getting a steam rice roll  i could see my meal being prepared  very interesting! my fresh shrimp with scallions  corn and sprouts with egg in the rice roll was delicious! i highly recommend! they serve chinese pancakes as well as rice rolls  coffee tea beverage service was not available yesterday  with the 'extras' on my roll  my meal came to $10 50  there are many options available with the rice rolls   vegetables  pork  dried shrimp  fresh shrimp  etc  i recommend you go check out joe's steam rice roll 
fantastic fresh steamed rice rolls made to order right in front of you  definitely a must on your flushing food crawl 
came here after 2pm on saturday to try steam rice roll at this new place   i missed my favorite scallion steam rice roll at lok lok (closed permanently)   ordered the plain with scallion   based on owner's recommendation  ordered beef with scallion and corn   they were made right in front of you   the texture is thin  silky and smooth   the plain with scallion does not have enough scallion compared to lok lok  also this is more expensive   however  i do like the beef steam roll   the beef added a good flavor to the whole dish and the corn was surprisingly a good addition too seating is very limited   glad that we came after lunch rush and were able to get a table and chairs soy milk and curry balls are not available will definitely come back again 
nestled away in a tiny food strip mall across the way from the new world mall are some of the best (and only) nice noodles you can get outside of dim sum the rice flour is stone ground on the premises and then each rice noodle is steamed to order from the freshly ground rice flour you have a choice of pork  beef  shrimp  dried shrimp and some others  prices start at $4 4 50 for small and $6 $6 50 for large  we split a large because this was our second stop (we had which bear dumplings  which is about a block and a half away)  for an upcharge  you can add egg  you get three free add ons  out of the five options we chose corn and scallion  at the end they topped the rice noodles with some sesame seeds and a light brown sauce  perhaps hoison  overall  i would highly recommend trying these rice noodles! there are tables in the back to dine 
i am a cantonese and this is the best place to get steam rice rolls unless you are taking an airplane back to guangzhou  the outside rice layer is very thin  smooth  and soft  meet is also fresh  rice rolls with curry fish balls are also tasty and very close to what you would get in hong kong 
amaaaaazing rice rolls  a real treat that is impossible to find in this country melt in your mouth texture  with balanced delicate flavors  highly  highly recommended 
you can easily walk past this place since it's so tucked away but that would be a mistake  for a measly $4  you can get a "small" plate of rice rolls that are perfect for lunch  i got beef with corn  scallions  and sesame seeds and it definitely filled me up  they have extra sauces on the counter if you need more which was a nice touch  the rolls were perfectly made and i couldn't be happier  my friend got the barbecued pork with scallions and it was great! i didn't know what to expect with the sweeter meat but it didn't disappoint  this place is definitely a keeper!
it is very good & steam rice rolls are my favorite   i always come and eat steam rice rolls once a week  the boss and the workers are very friendly  
rice rolls that focus on fresh and made to order  i don't know how they can make the rice rolls so soft  silky  and thin creating the perfect marriage of meat  vegetable  and rice flour  got my order in fewer than 5 minutes and i love how they put soy sauce on the side so that your rice rolls do not end up soggy like other places  definitely the go to cheap eats in flushing 
cheap  delicious and fresh  fun to watch them make it too  vegetarian friendly (free veggie add ons like cilantro  scallions  bean sprouts  etc ) seating is limited but available nearby  i order a small dried shrimp roll and it was a nice size    pleasantly surprised  also tried the beef cabbage roll  yummy  three orders plus the fish balls came to $14 with an egg add on  (skip the curry fish balls tho  small and salty  no flavor )
we wanted to grab a quick snack in flushing  since i am a big fan of steamed rice noodles  we stopped here for a quick bite  the noodles are freshly made and super thin almost like paper thin  you can add  toppings to the noodles 
cheap filling and delicious little cheung fun place  hit the spot for cravings and had a small but good enough selection  curry fish balls were not my favorite but the pork and beef are good 
made to order steamed rice rolls with your choices of veggie toppings  you can pick up to 3 kinds for free! add an egg for extra charge! you should definitely finish the food right after it's served  they have a tiny counter and some tables inside the store 
100% freshly hand made  i love coming to this place every time i'm here in downtown flushing    they do offer medium for $4 and large for $6 (except fresh shrimp $4 5 for medium and $6 5 for large)   the owners are extremely friendly and welcoming 
joe's steam rice rolls are very soft and fluffy  you first order your meat that goes inside your rice rolls and choose three veggie garnishes  eggs are $1 extra  the steaming process takes about 5 7 minutes  on weekends this place is packed  lines end up outside the store  you can also call ahead to place orders  the workers speak both english and chinese mandarin  the owner i believe speaks cantonese  try their fresh made soy milk  very good and taste way better than the ones you get at a supermarket  wish they had more seats inside 
first i had no idea i would be eating here today  wifey and i decided it be a good thing to goto flushing and try something differebt and new  so we walk and upon arrival right at the door we notice the small shop  it was about 1130am  so they had just open  i got to watch first hand how freshly made the steam rice rolls are made  we asked for 3 orders  shrimp rice roll with cilantro and scallions and a side of hot oil  hands down this one has a nice crunch and taste  the shrimp was very tasty and the dish itself was very light  the shrimp with cilantro and scallions was a perfect combination   my wife loved the curry fish ball rice noodle  very taste  had a little bit of sesame  abd very well balance dish  the dish was drizzled with the traditional peanut  sesame and plum sauce    my least favorite were the beef rice rolls  we both felt the beef did not carry enough flavor to compete with the 2 others  will come back again and bring the rest of the family  only problem i can see is that there were only 6 seats in the back area  so seating down maybe optional  i think this would be more of a togo meal  either way joe has a winning recipe for his steam rice rolls 
i visited for the first time today  the stall is conveniently located right by the 7 train subway station (as well as many bus stops)  i ordered small rice rolls with three (free) veggie add on's (great for vegetarians) for only $3  it was pretty fast too  less than 5 min  the guy was done  you can watch them make it right in front of your eyes so you know it's fresh  it was delicious and filling  i would definitely come here again  there is some limited seating in the back; it's a bit dirty and unkept  unfortunately  i did not see any trash cans for me to dispose of my garbage  other than that  a quick and delicious bite 
joe's steamed rice rolls located in flushing  this place offers authenti and traditional chinese foods  this is a place definitely worth trying  the owner brings the old fashioned guangdong stone milled rice rolls and makes with fresh toppings and you can also ask for add egg on it  great food and great service  they also have curry fish balls  scallion pancake  tea egg and stone milled soy milk to serve 
i never used yelp before but joe's steam rice rolls is worthy to spending the time to sign up an account! four days vacation here in new york and wanted to explore traditional chinese cuisines around flushing  instead going somewhere else  i was stuck with this shrimp and beef rolls with egg  no vegs  had to have it everyday no matter what  never know how smoothy and wonderful steam rolls can taste and how patient i am waiting in a long line before this one  the owner is nice and employees are friendly  my flight is in 3 hours and joe's steam rice rolls is my last stop before heading to airport  what should i do without this yummy steam rice rolls?
really delicious perfectly balanced fresh steamed rice rolls  got the beef with egg bean sprout and corn  $5 for a small  good enough for a meal or snack  minimal seating and quick service 
i like to eat rice rolls almost every weekend either from the cart ladies on the street or at dimsum or wherever i can find them  so when i found out that a fresh rice roll place popped up in flushing i decided to check it out  this location is at the front of the mio life mall right on roosevelt  after trying to come here a few times during opening week and being unsuccessful at getting some  they were either closed or no one was behind the counter or no rice base left i finally got to come in the middle of the afternoon to try it  what makes joe's different is the freshly made rice base created by using a mill to grind and make his own homemade rice flour for the slurry that makes up the rice rolls  the whole process is fascinating especially as he swirls your toppings deftly over the wide metal pan and slides it expertly into the steam drawer  there are a ton of toppings to choose from but i mostly go for the plain noodles no meat filling since veggies like corn  scallions and beansprouts are free  the meat fillings are an extra $2 like baby shrimp  regular shrimp  beef and roast pork  i only added an egg for $1 which is cracked in over the fillings and yolk is scrambled over the top right before steaming  even the cutting process is cool as it is delicately folded and sectioned  the end result is a very soft almost translucent noodle  i liked the egg  scallion and corn combo i got  it was like a medium sized portion and filled me up just enough  each order takes awhile since these are all freshly steamed  but there are a few stools at the counter to watch the show as he makes each one  they take about 5 minutes to steam  they also gave me a good sized container of sweet soy sauce and peanut sauce on the side for the noodles and sprinkled some sesame seeds on top as requested  i think they use creamy skippy to make their sauce but either way i liked it  the best time to come is half an hour to an hour after opening so he gets the rice flour and everything else prepped and definitely before 5 in case he runs out cuz once theres none he's done 
i think i would give it a 3 5  but rounding up because i think they are pretty good the first time i came here with a friend i had the pork rice roll with egg  bean sprouts  scallions and cilantro  my friend picked the shrimp one with the same toppings  the pork one was ok  but nothing too special  it felt like when you have leftover roast pork and you throw it in for a little extra heartiness  the shrimp was ok too  but it was a little disappointing because they were a bit overcooked  so they were getting a bit on the mushy side  the bean sprouts added a little crunch and the egg made the dish a little heartier  bean sprouts added a nice crunch to it  although i asked for cilantro  i couldn't really taste it but i did notice they put lettuce it  so they might have mistaken that part  we both ordered a large and it came out to $14 which was pretty pricey for two orders  we both weren't really full from it but thankfully we were going to eat other things that day i came back again with another friend and this time we shared one large order  we went for the beef with egg  corn  scallions and cilantro  i would say beef is the better one of the three  i usually dislike beef rolls because most places have a beef paste for the filling  but this place uses minced beef which i prefer in terms of texture  the corn added a bit of sweetness and texture to it which i liked  the scallions and cilantro added a little freshness to it  if i do come back  i would probably just order the beef one next time  again prices are a bit high for it  but they do make it right there for you to see so you know it's fresh  there is very limited seating in this place because it shares a space with various vendors so it is best to get it to go  i did notice they had seats right in front of their space  but it gets packed around breakfast time  so unless you want to be surrounded by customers trying to order  i would just take it to go 
i was so excited to finally get to try these rice rolls! after seeing the videos of how they're freshly made to order  i had to have it  i was disappointed either  they're located in a shared space with other vendors and they have a few bar stools at their tiny counter for customers who can't find seating in the area a little further back into the strip  you get to pick a protein (beef  pork  shrimp  etc) and then 3 add ons (lettuce  corn  scallions  cilantro  and egg for extra $)  they then make your order right there! they add a soy sauce and if you want  peanut sauce and hot sauce  the rice rolls are fresh  silky  and reminds me of chinese comfort food  i would've liked if the soy sauce was slightly sweet like they serve at dim sum since it was mostly salty and didn't completely compliment the rolls  i got the beef rice rolls with corn  scallions  and cilantro  and added egg  and shrimp with lettuce  scallion  and cilantro  my other tiny gripe was that the shrimps were a bit small and still had the poop vein inside  other than that  i really enjoyed it and the egg was a nice addition  the order was made quickly and i would definitely come back to get my cheurng fun fix 
delicious rice rolls  got the large beef with lettuce  corn and eggs (extra charge to add eggs)  loved how well their soy sauce went with everything and service was friendly 
they use a big steam pan to make their rice rolls  so the noodles come out especially thin and silky ^_^
best rice rolls i have tried in queens   the skin is think with a nice chewiness 
i had a shrimp rice rolls and pancake    its pretty tasty "cheung fun" and pancake  huge portion too!
i ordered the steam rice rolls with bean sprouts  eggs & green onions   it's my first time having steam rolls mixed with eggs   it was good  silky and innovative   it could've been better   it's lacking the rice flavor which was why it was very translucent   the staff was efficient   i only waited 5 mins for my order considering there were 3 orders ahead of mine
excellent quick meal or snack  $5 gets you fresh made rice roll with choice of meat  veggie toppings and an egg  i've had the beef (sliced) and the pork (ground)  the small size is enough for me and it's only $2 more for a large  ingredients are fresh and the texture of the noodle is great  the store is in the front of a mini food mall with a coffee store and dessert store as well   nice addition to flushing 
finally a place that uses 100% beef for beef steamed noodles (gnow cherng   niu chang) and none of that pasty shit!!!so when i was a kid    probably 20 years ago or so    (damn now i feel old bringing it up) a handful of places used real beef in steamed noodles  every one knew where they were  then commodity prices went up  along with rent  cost of living  and one by one they replaced real beef with some pasty mushy brown stuff in the rice noodles  i accepted that this was the evolution of times and some things i had no control over  yesterday i took the subway home to see parents for the weekend and see a line for this rice noodle place     oh yeah?! is the hype for real???it  was  real  real beef   this will be my excuse to "go home to see parents" more often  (oh damn after checking pics i think i might have my rice noodle stalls mixed up    too many on roosevelt  x you can hold my 5 stars for now)
i love made to order rice rolls  they don't stick together when they're fresh and there's such a pleasing fluffiness to them  they make em fresh at joe's and they're great  make sure to spend the extra $1 to and an egg and another extra $1 to get four curry fish balls (that were kind of lukewarm  disappointingly) 
very good steam rice rolls! staff are friendly and it's interesting watching them make ur food in front of you  fast service 
uniquely different from the usual rice rolls served at dim sum restaurants  the rice rolls served here come in much lighter dough and has very generous portion sizes  i definitely prefer this version to its heavier cousin   my thinking is that somehow rice rolls got bastardized in the us as chinese restaurants slowly adapted to white ppls' tastes  oh well  at least it's making a comeback now! the large and small options are priced at $6 and $4  respectively and it's totally worth grabbing as a snack before you continue on your flushing trek 
smooth and thin rice rolls  my only complaint is that their soy sauce is terrible  they dilute regular soy sauce and give that crap to people  first i tried it with their soy sauce  it was absolutely horrible  good thing i took all the rice rolls home and used the lee kum kee sweet soy sauce that i had at home to save the dishes!!  with my own sauce i bought at the supermarket  then i really enjoyed the food   3 stars only because without the soy sauce correction it isn't great 
i always wondered when someone was going to open up a shop exclusively for rice rolls   that dish is my favorite part of dim sum but i've never found a truly great place that made it like they do in hong kong   well  now i finally found one!  you are able to put in lots of other toppings that they don't have in dim sum places such as cilantro  eggs  bean sprouts  etc  and seeing the grain mill in action makes it that much better 
the owner was very friendly and kind  the steam rolls were freshly made on the spot right in front of you  he even was kind enough to upgrade an egg for us  would return for good customer service  and freshness of food 
this steamed vermicelli roll in here is really good  it made me feel like in guangzhou again 
i've tried many times of joe's steamed rice roll  overall i give five stars  in the beginning the rice roll i had tried was sticky and thick  and now over months of improvements  they made it right at the spot! the rick rolls are snow white  smooth smooooth smooooth and fresh!  willing to recommend? = yes!
awesome steam rice rolls! fresh! made from scratch! we got the curry ball and the bbq pork rolls  pretty good  you can add toppings to your order like egg or corn or lettuce  good flavor  decent portion  totally coming back to try the other items  they sell tea eggs and soy milk too  there isn't any places to sit  more of a take out place  they charge $6 for the large size and $4 for small size 
this is the best rice rolls that i've tried in new york  highly recommend it! the rice roll skin is thin and chewy  just like what i had back in guangzhou  ordered three different ones  beef  shrimp  and plain with egg  all are good  i finished them all before i remembered to take a picture  will come back for large portion 
i ordered the pork  beef  roast pork & shrimp  i loved the pork the best  the steam rolls were all consistent and soft  they just get it right!
the service is good and price is affordable  i ordered a egg steam rice  it tastes awesome  next time i will try again
how do you determine if a steam rice roll store is good? the roll has to be smooth  and put lots of sauces  you know  steam rice rolls do not come with any taste and they really rely on the sauces to give the flavor this place? meh  first of all  it's not even in a roll shape but rather  some steamed thing pushed together  is it smooth? kind of   yeah  i'll give you that  but here's the deal breaker     they are very stingy on sauce  that really killed the fun of eating steam rice rolls  is the food edible? yes  did i enjoy eating it? nah   
the rice rolls are to die for  no seating available so you kinda have to eat standing up outside on the sidewalk  so so so delish 
you can't beat fresh tasting food  that is also delicious  my favorite is barbecue pork  with corn and scallions   get large  that is a meal (for avg size person) 
they open at 8 30am does not mean you can get your food before 9am  i came here twice at 8 45am and8 50am  they are opened but nothing got set up yet  rice rolls is not bad  they have oden  but only the daikon is good 
watching these being steamed in high tech equipment was an experience in itself  actual taste of the rice roll was great but some may find slimey 
go to chinatown in manhattan u can get real rice rolls with meat inside     the meat here is old and decaying lmao
this is the best type of dim sum food i have ever tasted     it's something you cannot find anywhere else     i've been here twice in three days     it's a must try
just tried the small size steamed rice roll with shrimp  it's good  and small size enough  for a girl 
surprisingly pricey for rice rolls compared to other places i've been     but the quality is better  i ordered a large beef ($6) with egg ($1 extra) and ordered three free "vegetables"  corn  cilantro and scallion  re  steamed it when i got home and poured on the sauces they generously packed for me  delicious  if you think about it being a meal for one  it's not that badly priced  this place was the least oily and most tasty rice roll place i've been to 
i ordered based on the positive reviews i read here  what a let down  4 stars for entertaining value of watching the rice sheets being made  they have no idea how to roll it  it's scraped with a scraper into a convoluted pile and shoved unceremoniously into a styrofoam box  i ordered the roast pork (char siew) and the shrimp version  it wasn't char siew as i know it  just shredded cooked pork   tasteless  the shrimp was precooked   bland  the soy sauce that came with it was just that; not like the sweetened version you get with cheung fun at the dim sum restaurants  not cantonese dim sum by any standards also ordered the crepe  i don't remember the name they gave it  it comprised of a fried pancake dough with bean sprouts  egg and choice of ham or bacon  looked interesting   the result was a tough and chewy burrito  definitely not worth the time to stand in line to order 4 stars for the concept   good location with large window by the street that catches the attention of pedestrians  lots of foot traffic near intersection of roosevelt & main  their success also comes from reviews here and other sites  possibly through social media also 4 stars for value; you get the carbs and protein in an inexpensive meal  fills the stomach  knocked off 1 star for waiting time and lack of space to eat it 
fresh rice rolls  great service  tasted different than the typical dim rice sum rolls because they make their own rice paste 
great place to stop for a snack  this needs to be a chain around the city  i'd eat here 3x a week if i lived flushing 
like many people who love dim sum  i always look forward to the steamed rice rolls  hearing about a place that only makes steamed rice rolls? i cried tears of joy  the menu is simple  it's made fresh before your eyes  if there's a seat  sit down and enjoy  or if you're like me horde a few large orders  carry them home  and eat them away from everyone's shaming gaze  i chose not to add an egg because i like the classic texture of the rice roll and the filling i chose; no distractions  maybe next time  i'll add an egg to one  maybe 
joe's steam rice rolls are satisfying on so many levels  the rolls are freshly made by hand right in front of you by the owner and are super delicious; the additional veggies  sesame seeds  and hot oil provide the perfect umami flavor profile; and  the large sized rice rolls sit well in your stomach and completely wiped away my hunger pains  there are small wooden tables to the side where you can sit and much on your rolls without interference  would definitely recommend for a quick bite to eat when you're hungering to satisfy a craving for rice rolls  say hi to joe!
this is a great place to eat steam rice roll ( cantonese style)  best in town rice rolls and the young owner learn from china the skill to make rice rolls  passion and quality very good place to eat 
i've had rice rolls in the past at either the food trucks or the random open store window  but never one that makes it so fresh! what a difference in flavor! sooooo glad this spot is open  the texture is soft and chewey while the extras add a nice touch  best part is that it is right near the train so i can grab one before work!
so yummy  the price is good  and environment is comfortable  the pork steam rice is very special and delicious 
it wasn't bad  it wasn't amazing   how this place got 4 5 stars  i have no idea   their noodle's are good quality  but their filler isn't that flavorful  which is why this place is a 3 star for me   i heard anthony bourdain came here  don't let that hype you up   he's great on tv  but that doesn't automatically make this place incredible 
flavors are good but they didn't clean the shrimp  i had to throw the whole thing out 
had high expectations for this place because of the good reviews  but the steam rolls tastes really bland  even with the sauce they put on it  won't come here again 
the food is cheap and the food came out hot  i've tried the pork rice roll  bbq pork rice roll  beef rice roll  and chinese pancake and they all were very basic  nothing mind blowing  i wish they had different sauces that can enhance the flavor and make it more tasty  if you're just looking for quick cheap eats  this may be the place for you 
silky and smooth steam rolls i ever had in new york  super nice boss! 10 10 will come again 
the rice rolls were great  the slurry comes from a stone mill ground rice and water not from flour  it is really fresh  it is the right consistency that even some dim sum places don't get right  it is just the right firmness and not mushy at all  the menu is simple but in chinese  that is ok  joe is really friendly  i got the shrimp and my brother got the beef  large order  he cracks an egg onto the roll and steams on a metal sheet with the filling  the shrimps could be larger  i also would have like some peanut butter sauce too  but the roll was perfect chewiness 
visiting from miami  staying in flushing n found this hidden gem  gotta say i'm amazed by the rice rolls they have comparing with ones they sell at dim sum places  will def come back for my next visit!
best steam roll ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!the toppings are fresh  the owner is funny and knowledgeable  i will definitely be back for their new menus 
this place is great  pretty much the best steam rice rolls i've had in ny  their small portions are big!! as in you will be able to finish it by yourself but won't be eating anything else after that apparently they are going to start opening even earlier during the summer (around 8 am)  which makes me very excited about getting my breakfast here for my summer classes  from this location i have tried both the pork and the beef  both very good  somehow they manage to make the rolls thinner in this manner making the rolls wrinkly (which is very good) so more sauce can seep into this delicious simple treat  so good so good 
i hear a lot about this place  finally i have a chance to check this place out on my summer vacation   tried the small beef steam rice roll with free topping   corn and scallion ( because i want it to be more simple some i can have more taste of the roll )  $4 for quite a lot portion of rice roll  the owner is very friendly love to share his story about why he wanna making this amazing rice roll he simply just told me   that he wanna bring his hometown taste to new york  since no body wanted to   amazing roll  really soft and taste   i will come back for the next 4days and have enough roll before i leave nyc 
a take off of the traditional beef and shrimps chong fun rolls   they are very good here   a great brunch item   i can't get enough of it   all the items on the menu are very good   go for it even though if there might be a sustantial waiting time 
as a cantonese  i can tell the rice rolls here are really authentic  better than any other rice rolls i've ever had in new york  i will definitely come back!!
this is my mom's favorite place to go  it's all she talks about now  why? she is from hk and this places bring back memories for her   they make authentic steam rice rolls   not the kind that comes out cold and hard in tea house  these are pillow soft!  even i can tell the difference! this place is also super cheap!
the steamed rice rolls seem pretty orthodox something you can only taste in china you wont regret trying  the portion is quite big as well  i would definitely come again 
people proclaiming this to be the best rice rolls ever have never had good rice rolls  he is clearly ripping off the popularity of sung hing lung in c town or any of those street cart venders  i love rice rolls so when i saw this i immediately wanted to try it  these rolls were ok but for the price not worth it especially considering i could get cheaper and better from a street car  when you come to flushing you are looking for cheap eats that also has to taste good  also the service was not great  my order was ready and i had paid for it when i ordered  the person behind the counter wouldn't hand it to me because she was helping other costumers  at one point she even walked off somewhere  i think to get some change  finally i had to ask if that was mine that was just sitting there  of course it was cold by the time i got to eating it  they only included one container of soy sauce for my take out & didn't even ask if i wanted peanut or hot sauce 
best cheung fun in ny  thin  soft  slight chewiness  fresh steamed to order  got the beef and dried shrimp  mixed in some veg as well  tasty  nuf said 
happy i came here with my mom after searching yelp for breakfast  i got bbq pork steamed rice rolls  they were soft but could've used more generous filling  a small will run you $4 and a large is $6  veggies are free  overall it hit the spot and i'll probably come back another time 
the texture of the rice roll doesn't feel like hand made  but still very traditional canton food which i love 
quite authentic rice roll  in hong kong style with a modern twist  can add some new ingredients like veggies  onions etc  the rice roll itself is perfectly cooked  though i do recommend making better sauces  the chili sauce is not spicy and aromatic enough  the soy sauce is fresh out of the bottle without additional seasoning like usual rice roll dim sum place  one shall cook it with vegetable oil and sugar prior to serving 
i'm appreciated the owner's attempt to bring authentic cantonese rice roll  however the roll itself lacks of flavors  also the price is way higher than other similar street foods in the neighborhood i will not go back 
delicious and delicate   rice roll was silky smooth and perfect  so much better than any dim sum place  you can choose your fillings and they make it on the spot so it's fresh and yummy! must try!
came in an hour prior to closing and ordered bbq pork rice roll  it was cool to see it being made fresh  portions are pretty decent for price you paid  flavor is unique with rice roll (much thinner than usual din sum resraurant)  there are a few seats to sit in food court  will definitely be back to try other flavors 
delicious  snacks  bring back lots of childhood memories in hk   wish the mall has an area for dining
definitely the best steam rice rolls in town   unlike other places  the rice rolls here is amazingly smooth and fresh  the roasted pork rice rolls is a must have 
super good rice rolls! we got the shrimp with all the yummy add ons (bean sprout  egg  cilantro) for only $4 and it was big enough for two people to snack on  will come again when in flushing for sure 5 out of 5!
the food is very good  we ordered 3 cold dishes  bean curd  jellyfish w turnip & cucumber garlic   fantastically wow!  shanghai shaomai  hot soy milk are all so good   steamed crab meat delivers the high standard   i have reviewed again one year later  this time i gave full score of 5 stars   not only did all the food above par  their service is excellent   they are efficient  attentive and polite   my husband was running late in joining us  not one time did they come to hurry us to leave   we came around dinner time  when they are people waiting in queue   we are impressed!
nan xiang xiao long bao has absolutely the best soup dumplings in north america (the only real contenders being in the shanghai region itself)  they use just the right amount of fattiness in the pork and the filling is perfectly seasoned  something to note is that the dumplings are a bit larger than most places  as such  the skin is a bit thicker and doesn't tear easily other standouts include the scallion pancakes and the spicy beef with tripe  the pancakes are perfectly crisp on the outside without being excessively oily and have a hint of softness on the inner layer  the beef tripe is tender and packs a good amount of heat without being overwhelming i come to new york for the chinese food  i do the pilgrimage to flushing when i want the best  nan xiang xiao long bao is absolutely worth the trip 
i love this spathe design is so cutethis is only place i give 5starsvip service is what i getlove their flower wallevery time i check in with itwaiting for my next "nail design"
amazing place for soup dumplings! decided to come due to hearing such good things about this place and i'm happy to say they definitely didn't disappoint! came with a group of 8 and had a short wait of about 20 30 mins before we were seated  we ordered the crab and pork soup dumplings  the beef and tripe  and the crispy pork buns  definitely one of the best soup dumplings that i've had the opportunity to try  each one was very flavorful and had decent portions  the flavor of the soup was exceptional and it was only enhanced by the chili oil and black vinegar  the service was good for how busy the staff was  you can definitely tell that theyre food is all they need to bring in customers! would definitely return to get more soup dumplings and crispy pork buns! fyi   this place is cash only! super cheap for so much food!
this is an awesome place for a cheap but filling meal! i came by around 6pm for dinner on a saturday and our party of four was immediately seated  it's definitely a casual ambience  we ordered a good number of dishes  the crab and pork xiao long bao  the pork xiao long bao  pig ears (aka my favorite dish)  chive and meat buns  scallion pancakes with beef  another type of bun  and soy milk  we left feeling super full and didn't finish a few of the buns  the soup in the xiao long bao was delicious! better than anything i had in china  we ended up paying $12 each (including tax) for all this food  awesome food quality and quantity for the price!
i dragged myself to flushing on the subway and was pretty grumpy about it  but everything was okay when i had the pork xiao long bao at nan xiang  the were soooooo big and tasty  i loved it so much and it was worth the trip to flushing  we only got the xiao long bao  one pork and one pork and crab  pork was better 
nxxlb is one of the few "always mentioned" places in flushing which live up to the hype the move is to bring cash and go during the week or the afternoon  you should also tip well because people here are on top of their game and work hard  if you've had this type of food before i wouldn't suggest waiting in line for weekend lunch  unless you love people watching skip the xlb and go for the shenjianbao  its pan fried  crispy on the bottom  soft  steamy on the top and moist on the inside i don't understand why people always go for the xlb at chinese restaurants  the pink oily goo that spills out all over the plate just kills it for me and the limp sack texture is also something i don't find terribly pleasing  but whatever  most things on the menu are good  just try not to get the noodles  go to a noodle house for that 
byob and cash only!! food is excellent as always  i usually order the soup dumplings and beef scallion pancakes but this time got some beef tripe in spicy oil  one of their delicious cold appetizers  sooo good! he only thing is that we joined an existing table  ordered food and they just deliver   no water nor plates  came back  food was great  service is about 2 5  (
the best soup dumpling place! it's cheap  there is a lot of seating  & the soup dumpling is tasty and decently sized  we ordered pork & crab soup dumplings  shanghai pan fried udon  & the pan fried pork buns  the soup dumplings are so good and i will keep coming back to this place just for them  there's actually a lot of soup inside (i recommend it with the black vinegar & ginger!) the food is really cheap too  so you can get a lot of yummy food at a good price  the only complaint i have is the oiliness of the pan fried pork buns because they served it last and by then i was already really full so i got really turned off by the oiliness of this  you can actually feel the oil on your tongue  this place can get packed really fast  but it is worth the wait  service isn't great  but the food itself makes it worth going  this place is cash only!!
my friends and i initially had a 20 minute wait at 2pm on sunday that eventually turned into a 35 minute wait  however  it's always a good idea to go here with a group so that you can eat family style  we got the spicy beef and tripe  pork xiao long bao  crab meat xiao long bao  pork buns  scallion pancakes  vegetarian dumplings  and chive and egg fried buns  they said the pork bun was pretty similar to the pork xiao long bao (same filling  but the bun is just a different dough and doesn't come with soup inside)  so i'd say skip one of those  they bring dishes out when they're ready  although we might have preferred to have them brought out all at once  for the price (everything came out to around $56!)  it's worth it 
the best dumplings i've ever had!!!full disclosure  this was the first traditional dumplings i've ever had but i have since tried many other authentic places  two on the same day after my first visit  and this is still the best i've had! the fun thing is i planned on going somewhere else but ended up parking right in front of this place  when i saw all the back to back years of bib gourmands from the michelin guide i knew it was something that i had to try  soooo glad i did  it was a magical food experience! (and so inexpensive)there were two of us  we only ate half of what we ordered because were stuffed  and took the other half to go and the bill was less than $30go! order all the things  i pretty much did and everything was excellent!
pretty good xlb  the fillings were soupy and flavorful  the wait wasn't too bad on saturday  i liked that they didn't seem to mind because we were a group on 6 and only ordered 2 orders of xlbs (we were on a food crawl tour) 
came to this spot with a large group of people on a saturday due to the good reviews  considering there was 10 of us  it took about 35 minutes before getting a table in the popular establishment while looking over the menu they gave us free green tea to start  got several dishes to share amongst each other steamed pork buns ($6 50)   thin layer of dough encompassing semi seasoned pork ball  good soupy interiorsteamed crab pork bun ($7 50)   crab meat is a little lost herepan fried udon ($7 50)   thick noodles with heavy seasoning  good to pair with a meat dishrice cake w  shredded pork ($7 95)   balanced texture and filling meatservice here is quick and the price point is solid  if willing to wait  one of the better options for a sitdown 
love coming here! my dad started taking me to this place about 3 years ago  it was his hidden gem that he only told me about right before he moved across the country!youre usually seated immediately  if not you may need to wait about 15min  the food is so worth it! its family style so be sure youre ready to share  but you dont have to! the soup dumplings are delicious and the rice cakes even better!i have to say i like joes food better  but the prices here are incomparable!
one of my favs for shanghainese comfort food! nothing fancy schmancy about this place  decent for large groups but better for a few friends to get together  service is quick  costs are cheap & food is downright authentic & dericiousssss! a must in the flushing area!!!
nan xiang xiao long bao in one word would be "overhyped " to be honest  i've had a better version of each of the items that we ordered elsewhere  steamed pork bun  a must order! larger than the average xiao long bao  and a better bang for your buck than din tai fung's version  however  din tai fung wins from a flavor perspective in my opinion scallion pancake with sliced beef  good  but not game changing  a solid order choice to add variety  pan fried pork buns  depending on your luck  this item may take a while to get to you  we overheard the waiter telling the table next to us that a 30 minute wait isn't unexpected  i don't think i'd order it again   i wish the bottom was crispier and the meat was less dry  rice cake with shredded pork & preserved mustard  my favorite out of everything we ordered  it's simple  but you can't go wrong with this dish  pork & vegetable wontons in spicy sauce & peanut sauce  this was the dish that disappointed me the most  i was really excited about the combination of spicy sauce and peanut sauce  but honestly it tasted like neither  *make sure you bring cash! **street parking  not bad  as long as you're willing to circle the surrounding blocks a few times  if you're from out of town  make sure you look up the rules for parking close to fire hydrants!
the xiao long bao here is tops  the pork soup inside is tasty without being greasy  the skin is slightly on the thick side at the top of the steamed dumpling the scallion pancake with beef is also excellent  thin beef slices wrapped in layers of crispy and fluffy fried dough  the sauce is a bit heavy  good for those who like sweet sauces waitresses were reserved but polite 
this place is a staple for me and my wife  we have been here a few times and the food is always good to  great  the soup dumplings here remind us of the ones we had at nan xiang in shanghai and are always good  the sesame pancake with beef is a hole run every time even if it's a little greasy  the seafood crispy noodle was a instant classic the first time we tried it so i suggest everyone to try it  with the food this good you know there will be a crowd and we go on saturday nights so there is usually a wait but the wait is never long  the place is gritty and cash only so you gotta look past that to experience the great food that they serve 
such a good place for inexpensive and tasty food! the pan fried udon noodles  garlic cucumbers  beef scallion pancake  and pork soup dumplings are a must! definitely hits all the right spots in all the right places!   ) highly recommend
solid xiao long baoin my quest to eat as many dumplings as i can around the globe  nan xiang was a nice surprise  the dumplings were of good size and held their delicious soup perfectly  they were a bit "doughy" compared to others but i will take this in place of a dumpling that explodes on lift off  the prices are reasonable too and the service was pretty good too!! we will definitely come back!!!
it is crowded  with about 20+ people waiting with a numbered ticket   inside there are 70% asians and 30% westerners   a few  are here with a travelling carry on  liked me    )overall  the food is not salty for my taste   odd enough  there is no salt or soy sauce on the table the pork and preserved cabbage was nice   4* the rice cake is a bit  qq when it cools down a bit   there is white pepper for sure   the preserve cabbage is mild  i was hoping a bit more sour xlb is great  5*  i can eat it all of them   the soup is good with about a soup spoon ful of juicy   yea  shanghai shao mai has an acquired taste and may not be for everyone  5*   i love the bold flavor  like dried shrimp and etc    yum pan fried pork buns is great  5*   they come out crispy bottom and juicy inside and nice bun texture i will come back for the xlb  and shanghai shao mai    i see many have the stir fried noodle and savory tufo   hum    
it usually took me an hour to get here from the city  but it's all worth it  basically everything you order will be great  i highly recommend their beef pancake  pig ears  spicy beef and tripe  and pan fried pork buns  they were so good and authentic  tip  make sure you get cash before you come here  it's cash only  if you forget about it  there's a atm inside the hotel cross the street  the service fee is around $2 3 5 
we did not have to wait long to be seated and the place was very packed a table for two kind of cold and breezy for it was one of the tables in the entry way tea came quickly and the beer wasn't to our liking but it was extremely cold which he enjoys i an more of a room temp beer drinker we ordered an assortment of dim sum and 2 different types of soup also a noodle entree the scallion beef pancakes were amazing i enjoyed how the hoisin was on the inside my sweetheart enjoyed his chicken soup and neither of us had seen it served that way before our waitress was polite but never checked on us  i had to ask for more tea(this time was room temp )i also had to flag her for our 2nd round of beverages i tried to catch her eye after 25 minutes empty by placing both bottles and tea cups at the edge of our table for she was behind me(i would say 2 5 feet) sweetheart enjoyed the way the dumplings were browned on the bottom we both prefer them smaller the flavor made up for the weight‍i was hoping for soup dumplings the fish in our seafood noodle dish had the perfect soft texture the fried dough sticks reminded me of a zeppole dough no sugar  i would have devoured them if a bag of confectioners sugar rolled by like this maybe i should have dunked them my bad?in a whole tasty pretty quick even though food arrived at the table here there  only thing is i do not like being hivered over as i place the tip on the tabke where were you when i was parched?oh standing behind me reaching between us as i button my jacket is not polite at all food fair prices filling tasty enough i am real simple keep my glasses full and appear here and there i more than double the tax so lol
people are probably going to cry blasphemy at my review  but i tried to love nan xiang  but i just couldn't! this place is featured on so many platforms  but i just don't understand it  it's not bad  but it's not stand out either  this place is hands down known for their xiao long baos (soup dumplings)  to be honest  i don't remember much of how it tasted and i've had it multiple times   the last time being 2 weeks ago  i just remember it being blander than the other xlbs i've had  the pork chop noodle soup which was fine  the pork chop was fried well and the soup base was tasty  but the noodles were underwhelming  i've also had the pork with cabbage noodle soup which was better than the pork chop one  the cabbage added nice flavor  but the pork was  once again  bland  i will say that they do keep their soup base consistently good be warned  nan xiang is very popular and there's likely a wait during peak hours on the weekend  try it for yourself just for the sake of saying you've had it!
o m g  i love this place  if i lived in flushing  i would probably come here once a week  i had one order of their pork xlb  shu mai  and beef & chili pepper noodle soup  everything was absolutely delicious!their xlb is the best i have ever had  it was very fresh and everything about it was just so perfect *drool*  just make sure to ask for the ginger sauce on the side with the xlb! the noodle soup reminds me so much of my mother's cooking  the soup has a good kick to it too  service was great  there was immediate seating for two  i love how they gave complimentary green tea  the prices are very reasonable  definitelyyy coming back when i am in the area again cash only
their soup dumplings are good of size and very delicious  the soup in the dumplings had the best flavor  by far the best soup dumplings i've had  to me it's even better than joe's shanghai  the pig ears  spicy beef & tripe  pancake beef & scallions and the fresh hot soy milk were all delicious  the service was fast  be prepare to stand in line if you come around lunch time  once you get your dumplings you know it's worth the wait 
probably the best soup dumplings i had in new york so far  *warning! cash only restaurant* i went at 8 30 pm on a saturday night so there was no wait and easily seated a party of 12  the service was mediocre  it was kind hard to order and get water refills  i would have to go to the server often i ordered 3 orders of crab ($6 25) and 3 orders of pork steamed buns ($5 25)  or xiao long bao  these were crazy cheap because 6 soup dumplings would come in a order   the soup dumplings were amazing  i couldn't pick a favorite between the two but most of my friends enjoyed the pork more  the soup dumplings were scrumptious and did not break when picking up with the tongs  plus the soup was flavorful too  my favorite technique to eating the dumpling is biting it on the side to leak some of the soup on the spoon  then adding some vinegar and chili oil and eating all in one bite  i also ordered the scallion pancake with slice beef ($3 50) and pan fried dumplings ($4 75)  the scallion pancake and dumplings were crispy and good but they don't compare to the soup dumplings in my opinion  i would order the scallion pancake again if i wanted more variety overall  this place seems to the king of xiao long baotaste  5 5 recommend getting pork and crab steam bunsservice  3 5bang for buck  5 5 five or six dollars for 6 delicious steamy soup dumplings  i could eat at least 2 orders by myself 
nan xiang is your no frills spot for exceptional  authentic shanghainese food  the xiao long bao (soup dumplings) are always on point  each one filled with piping hot soup rich in flavor  you know it's the real deal when everyone orders baskets and baskets of xiao long bao  the dumplings are larger in size than the ones i'm accustomed to  but hey  i'm not complaining! i also enjoy their shanghai fried noodles  always tasty and never overly greasy or salty this spot does get packed  but service is quick and the employees are extremely efficient  do your tastebuds a favor and visit nan xiang stat!
i've heard really good things about this place so i was excited to try it  my group of 3 came on a friday around 1pm and got seated right away  we came during the winter and it felt like they didn't have the heat on  so we were all still shivering in our jackets while we ate  i had heard that their beef noodle soup was super good  but when we ordered it  they said that they had run out or they didn't sell it anymore (they didn't have it for some reason)  the waitress recommended something similar  but the noodle soup that came out had small slivers of beef and the broth was spicy and sour  it didn't satisfy my original beef noodle soup craving  we also ordered soup dumplings and some pancakes  which were both very good  the place has a really good price for the amount of food you can get  there seems to be a small amount of seating and it looks to always be full  service was pretty quick  but we had to ask a couple times before we got some water  the place is also cash only 
this place is great  as a soup dumpling enthusiast  this place does not disappoint  i think their pork soup dumplings are as good  if not better than anywhere else in the city  unlike some places  their dumplings are huge  the actual meat is nearly the size of a golf ball  even with a generous portion of pork  they still contain a healthy amount of soup in each one as well  outside of the soup dumplings  their shanghai udon noodles are absurdly good  as are their fried dumplings and beef   scallion pancakes  living in manhattan it is a bit of a trek out here  but i think it's absolutely worth it 
as nanxiang's full name indicates  this place sells chinese soup dumplings  they also have your typical cafe comfort foods such as soy milk  scallion pancake  chinese donut  rice cake  etc  the soup dumplings were probably the highlight  i will definitely come back if i am already in the area service is relatively nice (for a chinese restaurant)  they serve you quickly  and refill your tea  they unfortunately only accept cash  there's a decent amount of tables  but it's a pretty popular place so there normally is a queue unless you go early ordered xiao long bao soup dumplings   bigger than most dumplings i've had; most dumplings can't be eaten in one bite  each has a lot of soup  the soup is super fatty! overall pretty darn good!soy milk (sweet)chinese donut (you tiao)   crispy and light  well donerice cake with seafood   a bit light on the flavor  but well cooked so it isn't too tough 
so i've been coming here for awhile and i must say  the food has lost two stars  the signature shanghai stir fry was sitting on a bed of oil  the soup dumplings was mediocre  even though this restaurant had back to back michelin ratings  it just doesn't cut it for the taste  however  my favorite cold plate of beef tripe is still solid  the scallion pancake with beef is also tasty  i'm used to bad service in authentic chinese cuisine spots  but today most of the staff was inattentive  note  my rating is not based on the service  things we had to ask for today  tea  so basic right? especially when it is 10 degrees outside  when the soup dumplings came  we had to ask for sliced ginger  twice  so our dumplings got cold and it just didn't taste good anymore  when we wanted to grab the staff attention  there were about five of them all on their phone  the staff wasn't rude  just wasn't attentive  won't be coming back for awhile  there's shanghai you garden that tastes way better  no wonder their wait time is at least an hour 
wow! wow  i wasn't able to take good photos because i was so hungry and downed everything as they came  but rest assured other yelpers' photos are accurate  i hear this place is busy regardless of the time of day  but i'm glad we only waited 5 10 minutes or so  the prices here   wowee  super affordable  broke college kid prices for homecoming american kid who studied abroad and is looking for authentic food kind of good quality  no complaints whatsoever  i particularly liked that they didn't bring out the food all at once like most chinese restaurants do helps you digest better we got the udon  the beef scallion pancakes (a solid favorite)  some buns  and a few dumplings  excellent meal  would come back if i lived closer 
this little place gets packed and expect to be seated at a table with another party of two  service here was on point and they start you out with nice complimentary green tea which was perfect on this quasi a cold day  we tried the dumplings pan fried which came out piping hot so be careful let them cool for a few minutes before you take a bite of them and scald your mouth like i did  i love the texture of the dumplings and the hot chili sauce on the table paired perfectly with them next we had the pancake with sliced beef and that was to die for  nice crispy outside juicy meaty inside  yum  plus this place is very affordable!
overhyped to the max!!!!honestly  i was so excited for this place but i really did not understand the hype built around it  talk about disappointment!their xiao long bao (soup dumplings) were just okay and the other food we ordered really didn't taste clean or fresh at all    i've definitely had better  more authentic  flavorful  and fresh shanghainese food elsewhere not much else to say than a thumbs down in my book  not coming back!
pretty good soup dumplings as reported   always busy and occasionally the wait staff will give you an attitude if you move slowly the side dishes are pretty good too although not great   i think of the place as a good place to hang out where everyone can enjoy the food to some level and some people will be wowed although most people who eat chinese food regularly in flushing don't find the place to be amazing 
the restaurant was very crowded but was no waiting  our food came very fast but no service at all  i even got the dipping sauce for xiao long bao by myself xiao long bao was great but beef noodle soup  we didn't need it  it was pretty bland  i was born and raised in japan  i'm used to the food many people call "bland" but it was still no taste loli would recommend just order xiao long bao to be safe 
great spot in flushing! we came on a weekend and had to wait about 20 minutes  ordered a ton of food and my cousin was raving about the scallion pancake wrapped beef  i think the highlight of this meal was the dumplings in hot oil and peanut sauce  highly recommend!!!great soup dumplings too    the skin was thin and the soup inside was not unbearably hot  i personally liked the pork and crab meat more  we also ordered a cold spicy beef and a satay udon  like all my other favorite chinese restaurants  the food came out 2 seconds after we ordered  gotta love maximum efficiency  if you're have a craving for some xlbs on a cold day  this place will definitely hit the spot!
not the best  but still sooo good! friends and i were in flushing running a few errands and we decided to warm up with some dim sum  definitely did not regret it after our meal  it was a bit crowded when we walked in around 3 pm  we were given a wait time of 20 minutes but only waited for 10  they were soo busy and seemed a bit understaffed so it took a while to get our order in  we ordered the fresh garlic cucumbers  scallion pancakes  noodles  crab pork soup dumpling and vegetable dumplings  the soup dumplings were filled with juicy goodness and the veggie dumplings are packed with different greens  everything we ordered was fresh and hot  giving us a "home cooked meal" type of vibe in the cold weather  worth a try if you're in the area and can't beat the cheap prices here 
we ordered lots of cold appetizers   the dried bean curd with edamame and cabbage was delicious   the cucumber appetizer was tasty too  seaweed was good   the spicy bean curd was great   for hot dishes we ordered scallion pancakes the beef and rice cakes were delicious   pan fried noodle with shredded pork was tasty        the soup dumplings were delicious   service was okay   i'm not rushing back because the menu is very limited 
what we ordered  hot soy bean milk  pork and crab xiao long bao dumplings  pork xiao long bao dumplings  beef rollprobably would not order the hot soy bean milk again    they serve it to you in a odd shaped bowl  why can't it be served in a cup??!? so hard to drink  both xlb were delicious (although neither of us could taste the difference between the two)  there were so much soup inside!! the wrapper is a little more thick but  it held all the juices together so i'll let it go  would pass on the beef roll too  they drown it with sauce so it's overpowering  just order the xlb  it's worth the long trip to flushing!
had a 15 minute wait  not bad  the food was fabulous  never had better chinese food  truly   the service attentive   the wait was organized   the atmosphere no frills   after the meal i used the only rest room which was fairly clean but no soap!  please someone let me know if they have soap when you go   that grossed me out since employees use this rest room too  it was a 5 star before i discovered this major flaw   i really hope this was a one time problem 
if you wanted to taste a pound of white pepper  then make sure you order the shanghainese pan fried udon  this dish wasn't bad per se  but it was poorly made  you can definitely tell nan xiang xiao long bao was trying to make it taste "traditional " but the chef went trigger happy with the white pepper sure  the chewy and heavy noodles were able to beautifully lather up with sweet savory soy sauce  but the downside was it captured significants amount of white pepper  now  don't get me wrong   there's nothing wrong with a bit of earthy spice but it's a different story when your mouth is layered with it  if the chef added more than two slices of pork  it would've helped dilute the white pepper overdose nan xiang xiao long bao has a serious customer service problem  i saw  while eating here  a waitress spill soup on a 55 year old man and barely apologize  in fact  the waitress seemed annoyed  she scrapped up a napkin  handed it to the customer  and then continued on her duties  the quarter drenched customer had to get up  get more napkins himself  and clean up the mess  absolutely appalling the environment is your standard flare with tables and chairs  it's a lot larger than you'd imagine when you first step in (separate rooms on the left and right) 
this bustling joint in flushing has (hands down) the best soup dumplings i've ever had   i've been a frequenter of joe's shanghai for quite some time now and while it still holds a special place in my heart  nan xiang does it better   here's why   nan's xiao long bao are saucier   poking a hole in their pillows of gluten delight leads to a flood of delicious pork sauce that requires a skill level above and beyond what is needed at joe's to not have it spill off your spoon   their crispy noodles are probably some of the best i've come across maybe ever   a heaping  hot bowl of beef noodles with plenty of sauce and just the right flavour was more satisfying than anything   they're quick on the tea  as you don't have to ask for it and it isn't a nightmare flagging down a waiter     wait lines are still a thing here  but you're not going to be waiting an hour like you will over at joe's   the service also isn't as gruff despite both joints being cash only   though who can complain with their prices?!  come  eat here   this is a mainstay for me now when i head to flushing 
cash only!my first time here  i thought i would try some of the biggest hits   the scallion pancakes were first and started things off well   it's hard to mess them up  but similarly hard to make them stand out  but nxxlb gets them down solid   the fried pork dumplings are massive  but do take awhile to cook so be sure to get something beyond this (which you most likely will) while you wait   they are incredibly filling and equally cooked through and through   the pork sui mai (shanghai style of course) was fine  but nothing to rave about   also to note  i rarely like to have any ginger with my xlb but the ginger here was so fresh  finally  the famous soup dumplings were off the wall great!  they had the perfect toughness on top to pull off the parchment paper  but the fluffiness on the rest of the dumpling melted in your mouth    as for the soup  no words could do it justice  but if i had to try i would say it would be the gold standard ideal of how these dumplings should be filled my only personal peeve was the hot soy milk   i got it in a bowl which is different from what i was use to (cup)   because the bowl was shallow and wide i was given a standard asian soup spoon  it took awhile to drink and got cold by the time i finished (and i was only focusing on the bowl)   however  i think this is only a personal and probably cultural preference  so i won't really consider that in my review   just wanted to put it here as an fyi for folks food  5 5service  4 5 5ambiance  4 5 5
this place is always packed and that must be a good sign right? although i have to say  their food is pretty well priced  but i just don't get the hype  i've had better shanghainese food elsewhere  their xiao long bao is good and so are their rice cake dishes  however  everything is very oily  but i understand that is the shanghainese style of cooking)  another thing is  their cold apps are way overpriced  to sum it up  quick service  good food  a tad overpriced  would return again if i'm ever craving quick and easy dining for shanghainese  but would definitely turn around if the wait is long 
one of the most popular xlb places in flushing but not the best place imo to get xlb  they are normally busy but if you go on an off time at about 2pm  they have plenty of seats available  i normally order the pork xlb  and the scallion pancakes  they are consistent with the taste and the xlb is delicious as always  i've tried their shanghai shumai which is flavorful here than in other places ive tried so their shumai is a must  their wonton with spicy oil and peanut sauce was just ok for me  theyre cash only 
they only accept cash  so we had to go to the nearest bank to take out cash  came here based on yelp reviews  but of course we didn't get what was highly recommended  i wasn't that impressed  it was ok for the price we paid  but wasn't worth the trouble of getting cash  the wait time for seating  ordering  receive our food wasn't long at all 
cash only  this review is solely for the xlb aka soup dumplings which were just okay  they tasted great  the pork was flavorful and yummy and not too greasy    buuuuut    they don't stay intact very well and the dumpling skin is on the dough ier side  i prefer a thin skin that stays intact  if you like the thicker skin you might not like these either because they weren't super thick but right in the middle  i feel like the dough ier thicker skin breaks easier because once it cools they dry out where as the thin skinned ones stay intact because they're slightly more stretchy and doesn't dry out  overall service is exactly what you're used to at any chinese restaurant in chinatown or flushing  no fuss but they didn't need to be asked to refill our tea  i wouldn't come out of my way to eat here again  there are plenty of amazing soup dumpling places in manhattan for decent prices  (6 50 6 dumplings here)
great soup dumplings  do not miss the dumplings  the other food is okay  interesting scallion pancakes  the version here has beef in wine sauce  much thicker and more substantial than anything i've had before  the two noodle dishes we shared were seafood crispy noodle and udon noodles with beef  just okay  as i said don't miss the dumplings they're truly great  how good is the food?  take a look 
i ordered the scallion pancakes  beef soup  and two orders of beef xiao long baos and i was extremely satisfied with nan xiang! the food came out really quick and was hot and delicious! i highly recommend coming to this place if you want cheap  but high quality food!
pleasantly surprised  came here on the recommendation of my cousin for the soup dumplings and i have to admit they were excellent  we had both the crab and the pork soup dumplings and they were delicious  the dan dan dish was also delicious  the kids enjoyed the different noodle dishes and the champaign tea  would definitely come back
we came here through the recommendation from some friends on the hunt for the best soup dumplings ny had to offer  we went here on a saturday for lunch and though there was a large group of people outside their doors  their was turned out only to be about 30 minutes which wasn't bad  everything on the menu looked really appealing and they had great prices to match  though i would have liked to order everything on the menu  we were limited by the space in our stomachs  we ordered a soy bean drink $1 75  garlic cucumber $4 95  pork xlb $6 50  and pork and crab xlb $7 50    the soy bean drink was tasted homemade and was a great start to our meal 4 5  the garlic cucumber is a must get  it seriously is so good  there is a perfect balance of garlic  cilantro  and cucumbers  the cucumbers were crisp and fresh and so refreshing to eat  5 5+  the pork xlb was piping hot when they brought it out  it had so much soup in there and the meat was well seasoned  nom nom nom  my only gripe is that the skin was slightly thicker than i would like it to be  i would have to rank this xlb as one of my top 3 places to get xlb 4 5   the pork and crab xlb was just as good and soupy  i just wish there was more crab flavor  overall really good as well 4 5 considering the food quality  price point  and wait time  this is definitely worth a visit and a must try and totally worth the wait  note  this place is cash only  so be prepared 
the first time i thought it was a fluke  but after the second time  i can now say that nan xiang is overrated   flips table pan fried dumplings  the skin is almost as thick as pan fried xiao long bao  it was also oily and greasypork xiao long bao  welp  every time i tried to pick one up the guts(the soup  haha) would spill out  other stuff i've tried scallion pancake  stale and coldsoy milk  meh i think i'll stick with shanghai you garden's xiao long bao in 40th rd  main st
steam pork buns is a must try! i loved their sliced beef and shanghai noddle  soy milk was very fresh 
is it even worth posting a review about this place? everyone's already said it  this place is a must eat restaurant for anyone who enjoys anything in life  while most of their food hinges on being good or the upper end of average  their xiao long baos (xlb)  soup dumplings  are so phenomenally good  nothing else matters imagine the homiest  heart warming soup  now bundle that up into perfect little packages  and you have a soup dumpling  sounds simple enough  but there is unbelievable variance in how this dumpling is made dumpling skin  there are some places like that dumpling stall in new world mall or the international phenomenon  din tai fung  where thin skin is key  i can understand the logic since having thinner skin often makes the dumplings all the more slurpable while allowing the soup to truly reign supreme   but if i wanted that  i would be ordering a bowl of soup  i love nan xiang's dumpling skin because it is thin enough to have a wonderful silkiness while still retaining a very slight al dente soup  the soup is fragrant and plentiful  ready to gush from the dumpling in a delightful (and painfully hot) torrent  other places such as kung fu xiao long bao in flushing also make remarkable soup dumplings  but it is intensely thick and rich  almost like the most decadent of ramen broths  nan xiang's soup broth certainly has a particular viscosity that lingers on your tongue  but it is also light enough to reel you in for seconds  thirds  fourths  a whole (or two) basket perhaps?overall  nan xiang xiao long bao is a step above its competition at least in the flushing main street neighborhood  although kung fu xiao long bao is a close second  the perfect balance between the supple dumpling skin and lip smacking soup broth makes nan xiang my personal winner  for an extra umami bomb  try the crab and pork xiao long bao 
the secret star of the show  the beef pepper noodle soup  the broth is divine   best broth i've ever had   surrounded by long noodles and beef and peppers after that  come the scallion pancakes  don't know what makes these so good  but they are  didn't think their soup dumpling or veggie dumplings were that extraordinary  would go back and just get the soup and pancakes 5 stars!!!!!!
one of my favorite restaurants in flushing because of the xiao long bao  noodles and side dishes   they are all   all delicious and extremely affordable  when i went last  on tuesday  we ordered the  xiao long bao with crab meat  the pork and veggie noodle soup (freshly made noodles yum)  scallion pancakes (used to love them with the beef when i was still a  meat eater)  turnip cakes  side dishes  jellyfish with turnip  spicy beef & tripe  seaweed & garlic   the steamed vegetable dumplings are delicious  love the chives  but not the best i've ever had  this might not be the fanciest restaurant in flushing but you'll have a satisfying meal that won't break the bank!tip  they allow you to bring your own wine
food  7 10service  6 10ambience  6 10price  $$reccomendation  wonton w  spicy peanut sauce  "fried bun" w chives & egg overall everything was pretty good  i thought the xiao long bao was aiight  i've definitely had better but that "fried bun" with chives & egg was bomb af  the service was just like any other chinese restaurant  kind of trash  if you don't know how to speak any mandarin then just point to the items like a fool like how i did  not a bad place to lay in the cut 
this review is for my visit in 2015 i have heard about this place for a while before i got a chance to give it a try  there was a little wait when we arrived  the line moved pretty quick though  the steamed pork buns or xiao long bao was definitely good with thin skins  tasty soup  and well seasoned meat  i have also tried salt soybean milk for the first time which had little shrimps inside and tasted interesting  scallion pancake with sliced beef was pretty good too but a little oily 
came on a sunday morning and we were seated immediately  ordered 4 items soup dumplings   thin skin  very rich broth  pretty sizeable with lots of pork on the inside  thinner skins means more flavor from the pork and soup  seafood fish cake   fish cake not overly chewy mixed with shrimp  mini scallops  fish fillet  not oily and on the blander side  which i liked cause chinese dishes tend to be too salty sweet soy milk   comes hot! not overly sweet here and went well with the fried donuts service was quick  the food came out as they were ready and the servers refilled our teas pretty frequently  everything here comes hot hot so be careful not to burn yourself 
was craving some juicy xiao long baos on a cold winter friday and finally headed to nan xiang after the numerous reviews on social media  my boyfriend and i ordered scallion pancake with beef  pork steamed buns  crab and pork steamed buns and sweet soy milk  all the food came fairly fast  the soy milk came in a huge bowl  warm and slightly sweetened  it was perfect  the scallion pancake was so so flakey and crispy  it was all that i've ever dreamed for in a scallion pancake  yes it was oily  but it was so flavorful you would forget the calories  must get!!! now onto the main  the xiao long bao  every single bun was bursting with soup  endless soup  the soup and filling were not overly salty or oily at all and it was just so so so enjoyable  i'm already looking forward to my next time back!!!
my new go to place for soup dumplings! i love this tiny place located in the busy section of 38 ave  and prince  food is good  4 stars because place is super tiny  and they only take cash 
i came here after seeing many good reviews here online and hearing the front desk of the hotel i was staying at nearby recommend this spot! the restaurant is quite spacious compared to most places around the area and there was no wait  the waitstaff do seem curt but they're quick and get the job done  plus  i know i'm coming here for the food not the service! i had the crab and pork soup dumplings and both were delicious! i do like the crab ones better since i think it has more flavor so definitely worth spending the extra $1  i was also craving fried dough (youtiao) and soy milk to dip in which was exactly what i expected    came out fresh and warm  can't go wrong with that! i do think this place is just as good as joe's shanghai but with more tables and no wait  at least in terms of soup dumplings  as for the rest of the menu  i'm not sure  but if you're craving some xiao long bao  this please would get the job perfectly done! cheap  fast and delicious 
really great place  this is a flushing treasure i highly recommend  sometimes there is a wait because it's so popular but trust me when i say that it's worth it  the beef dumplings are my favorite and the beef roll is king the area is flushing and it was very interesting to visit  feels like china haha 
one of the best xlb i've tried! texture and flavor of the pork xlb is perfect and i want to to try the crab flavor next time  also tried one of the best spicy beef noodle soup  their noodle soup is not oily or heavy like all of the taiwanese beef noodle soups i've tried  the beef is tender  the broth is light and hearty  and the best part is the use of longhorn peppers for natural spice instead of adding spicy pastes oils! definitely worth the trip to flushing and i will be returning to try more next trip 
nan xiang sets the standards for all nyc soup and damplings   it a good dampling place  with convincing you have to have dumplings everyday )nothing fancy  no fancy sitting but a good damplingi have had a lot of dumplings from all over the city taste all from different chefs and people this place makes something better  that makes me go there just for the dubmlig soup   well it's not like in china of course  it's totally different here the dumplings there was a young guy when we walked in and he was sweet enough to help us and choose the taste we like as you know the dampling hard to choose i also love the soup bowl they use it's cute and huge )
cash onlypretty good chinese food in flushing  came on recommendation from my taiwanese pharmacist  i was in the area for the us open  and decided well i'm rarely on this side of town so might as well make a trip down to flushing  its been about 5 6 years since i was last year! more on flushing itself in another post  (its changed so much!) came with a man friend who  is not asian but puts me to shame when it comes to how often and how much asian food he eats  my mother would be embarrassed  but we ordered 2 trays of xlb (soup dumplings) for him  1 pork and 1 shrimp  and i was incredibly excited to see that they had pan fried bao (not sure what the english name is) on the menu so i ordered a plate for myself  how i rate pan fried bao  crispiness of the skin on the bottom  juiciness of the meat on the inside  how well the meat was cooked inside  these bao's were 2 3  the meat was kind of still tender and pinkish inside (edible  but not as well done as i like them to be)  the bottoms were incredibly crispy! and juicy inside  so so yums stole of my eating partner's pork xlb and was delicious  hard to find good xlb in the nj ny area  so if you're craving xlb i would recommend coming here! pretty fast in seating people  we came on a sunday afternoon around 2 pm  close by to the 7 stop and close enough to spot dessert bar or tenren for you to get your sweets in!
warning  they might overcharge you  double check your bill receipt i ordered for takeout and when i came to pick up my food they told me my order total is $12 50  it was not until i came home to realize that the woman at the cash register decided to round up my bill and kept the change  my receipt said $12 46  i'm not going to call them to complain about 4 cents for gods sake  but you have been warned  if they're doing this to several customers i would imagine they are actually pocketing a good amount of change  i found this incredibly unprofessional 
long wait even at weird hours  so many tourists but we still waited and the food was pretty good so that's a plus  soy milk is too sweet but that's personal preference  fried dough is standard but rather pricey here (supply and demand tho)  every thing else was good and i have no complains  service was pretty swift and food also came pretty fast  overall a solid experience with good food  nothing special but no hassle  issa yes from me

the staff was slow to actually give us our food  then they got the order wrong twice  i ended up finishing my meal before my colleague even got his  then to make things worse i got a stomach ache thirty mins after the meal 
haven't been here for about 6 years  still cheap  delicious  might be too oily but pretty good quality  cleaner than i imagined 
long wait so be prepared  however  they also have a lot of tables available so it does go by pretty descent i would say average 30 45 minutes their foods are amazing  xiao long bao is flavorful  soupy  thin skin  does not easily break upon picking it up  beef pancake was super oily and crispy  its probably so bad for your body but it was something that you have to try  the vegetables are light and fresh  fried noodles are not my palate but others enjoyed  to me it was too much oil and soy sauce  service was good  typical of chinese servers to rush you out in a way  but used to it  i would definitely come back!
what amazing food for such a good price!  the soup dumplings are beyond delicious just like everything else on the menu  wish they had a bigger drink selection though
i ventured out to flushing with a friend this morning for some dim sum and stumbled upon xiao long bao  and we were both so happy we did we had quick service  great tasting food and all at a very good price  these aren't the best soup dumplings in nyc  but very solid and the egg chive pancakes were delicious  we also had the fried udon noodles which were great  four dishes and it all came out to $23    we'll be back!
great little restaurant with some of the best scallion pancakes and soup dumplings  the scallion pancakes were super flaky and crisp  while the soup dumplings had delightfully thin skin and were wonderfully juicy  also ordered the pan fried buns  which were delicious  but i felt there wasn't as much meat in the bun as i had hoped the ambiance was a bit lacking  but it felt like your average chinese restaurant  overall  great restaurant and great prices  i'll definitely be returning!
ever since i introduced xiao long bao or soup dumplings to my girlfriend  we have been on a mission to seek and eat the best bao in town  ny is famous for their bao and chinese food in general  the store has a modest decor and all the customers are chinese speaking  the menu offers translations for those of you who may not be familiar with the chinese vernacular  of course we order a round of pork xiao long bao but a few other items also peak my interest  i also request a bowl of spicy beef noodle soup and the scallion pancake with beef and hoisin  the scallion pancake is amazing with a perfectly crispy slightly greasy exterior  with tender slices of beef and sweet savory hoisin  probably the best prepared scallion pancake i've had in over a decade  they are typically saturated in grease but this one was not  delicious the beef noodle soup has sliced mild green pepper  beef and green onions  the broth is warming and savory  the noodles are chewy and springy  great noodle soup! now the main event  the xiao long bao for those of you who are not savvy to bao eating technique i'll give you a quick lesson (i'm not an expert but i get by)  use chopsticks or the tongs to gently pinch the top of the bao (thickest part) to very carefully transfer it to your plate  perhaps with a soup spoon underneath to give a false sense of security (it will not save your soup if it breaks)  careful because if the skin sticks to the bamboo steamer it may tear  once there place bao on your spoon  bite a small hole on top side to let steam escape and drink a bit of soup  with the vinegar added to the sliced ginger  use the tiny spoon to administer vinegar and ginger directly into your dumpling to your taste  now eat that bao and repeat  delicious  one of the best bao i've had come enjoy some xiao long bao and eat it like a pro  don't cry if you loose some soup though  it's sometimes unavoidable  atmosphere  4 5food drink  5 5price  5 5service  4 5overall  4 5 5
i have to keep things honest  this place is average at best  this place doesn't have the best soup dumplings  i'm going to have to try kung fu instead when i'm in the flushing area next time to compare 
it's an ok place  expected a better food experience  the food isn't terrible but not great either  the waiters are not attentive and the seating arrangements (tables and chairs) are an after thought  they just dumped tables and chairs there without having a planned layout  felt like they were not clean either  i wouldn't go back 
i know the debate between joe's shanghai and nan xiang  who got the best xiao long bao  is never gonna end but personally  i'd choose joe over this place  and here's why yes the xiao long bao is great  i think the filling (for crabmeat and pork) is pretty much the same as joe's  but the difference is the dough  i prefer joe's because it's thinner and hence  chewier  but you'd probably like nan xiang if you like it thick and more bao like  yes the beef noodle soup  the noodle itself is fresh and you can feel like it's really handmade  but they put a lot of jalapeno into the soup which i dislike very much so    one more thing  the side dish that i ordered  cucumber garlic salad  was so not fresh it was soggy  if you want this kind of beef noodle and side dish  i suggest going to dunhuang lanzhou beef noodle on 37th ave  trust me you'll see  of course  you can't beat the price here and plus it opens pretty late so i would still come back i guess 
scallion pancakes and soup dumplings     enough said! they are definitely worth getting  in fact  those are what i come to this place for anyway  this place is very popular for their soup dumplings  but i am sure they make other dishes too  for the soup dumplings  i would recommend the crab meat with pork (only $6)  obviously  its juicy and hot  so don't eat it whole  the scallion pancake is thin and crispy on the outside but chewy once you start eating it  cucumber with garlic is a pretty refreshing dish as well  the service is fast  especially with the dumplings  the place is all cash  ​unfortunately  but again  its chinatown so cash money all day eerday!
this place has really good food  and it's so inexpensive  i enjoy coming here because the place is spacious and like i said before the food is really good  i came here with a friend the other day and we got an order of their panfried "u don" (it's not really udon it's more like lo mein)  xia long bao  (pork soup dumplings)  egg and chives steamed bun  and the scallion beef pancake  i didn't think that we would get so full from those four dishes that are usually seen as appetizers  but we were stuffed  although  a little greasy the food was delicious and packed with flavor  wait time is usually about 10 minutes or less depending on what you order  soup dumpling take a little longer though  the one thing i will say about this place is that their sign is not in english  so just giving you guys a heads up  this place is the giant restaurant on the corner with the red sign and a bunch of people outside of it  also the wait staff is pretty friendly  but it can be a little challenging trying to get their attention because they're constantly moving back and forth between tables  but overall  i still really like this place and i will definitely continue to frequent here whenever i'm in flushing 
came to flushing to get some xlb  heard that kung fu had the best ones but i think they moved? was not down to walk 1 hour so we ate at nan xiang instead  we ordered the classic and the crab xlb and they were just    okay  the wrapper was too thick for my liking and the flavours are okay  i don't know  can't think of anything else to say  literally nothing stood out about those xlb 
last fall  my friends and i went here for dinner  we had to wait for about 20 minutes before we got seated  we ordered * 烤麸(fried gluten)* pork xlb* steamed vegetable dumplings* pan fried pork buns* shredded potato salad* pork and vegetable wontonsthe gluten was a bit sweet  the skin of the xlb was a bit thick  overall  the food was good but not spectacular 
cash only!cons  i came here to try the soup dumplings because  hey it's in their name and i've heard good things about it   turns out it was just ok   the soup is thick with a lot of fat blobs   everything else was great!  scallion pancakes with beef were really good along with the rice cakes and pork dish  the jellyfish was "diluted" with other things but it was relatively cheap for an appetizer 
they are truly the best at what they do  all the reviews and articles are right  you found the place  just go  worth the wait every time  i've tried all the soup dumplings flushing has to offer and nothing holds up to nan xiang! my biggest recommendation besides the dumplings would be the crispy pan fried noodles!! super delicious!
i had one day left in new york and my friend suggested we make a flushing trip for our lunch  he suggested we stick with the xlb here  so we went with an order of crab meat and one of the pork  these soup dumplings are massive and take some skill just to pick them up without breaking  while i expected much more out of the crab meat ones  the soup of the pork dumplings were delicious  beware of the long lines  so plan accordingly 
service is lacking here but i expected that  the food was disappointing  we had the beef noodle soup  noodle was over cooked  xiao long bao was huge  i wished it was smaller  it was hard to eat due to the size and the outer skin did not have the chewy texture i really prefer  the pan fried dumpling was probably the worst  it was so doughy and also so big  i'm surprised at the strong reviews  the pictures look better than it tastes 
this is the best place for xiao long bao which is soup dumplings or steamed pork buns in the us  i do prefer their steamed crab meat & pork buns more than their steamed pork buns  their scallion pancake with sliced beef is also very crispy and flavorful as well  their pan friend pork buns were just okay  it's nothing special  we also got their rice cake with shredded pork and the flavor was good too  but nothing special  overall it was still a good meal but can't compare with the soup dumplings in taiwan 
a fairly basic place but very good  the shengjianbao is definitely one of the better ones i've had in nyc  which is not known for having good shengjianbao in general  the wrapping was crispy on the bottom and not overly thick or doughy  and the filling was fresh and soupy  the xiaolongbao was quite nice as well  the broth was good but not exceptional  and the meat was fresh for soymilk you have have sweet and savory options  i went with the savory option  which is more like a tofu soup; not bad i would say the fried rice cake was excellent  the rice cakes were browned just the right amount  and the vegetables and meat were quite fresh we also had some cold dishes  the fried bean gluten was rich and oily but not overly so  with the right amount of seasoning  the cucumber with garlic was crisp and refreshing 
tasty and inexpensive shanghainese food  my friends and i came a bit earlier (around 6 15pm on a saturday) and waited only a few minutes to be seated  by the time we were done an hour later  there was a long line of people waiting outside  so i'd definitely recommend coming earlier if possible we ordered a variety of dishes  steamed pork xiao long bao   most popular item on the menu  these xlbs were full of hot soup and deliciously cooked pork! these were my fave  steamed pork & crab xiao long bao   similar to the pork xlb with a subtle crab taste  not too different in my opinion  handmade steamed dumplings   disappointed that these were pretty tasteless  definitely needed extra salt vinegar on them  pan fried pork buns   average pork buns with a thick and sweet skin  fried bun with chives & eggs   pretty good  is it weird to call this something like a chinese veggie empanada?  shanghai shao mai   never had sticky rice in shao mai before! definitely would order this again  cucumber & garlic   simple but delicious cold appetizer all in all a nice and cheap meal (~$40 for 4 people)  just note that it's a cash only restaurant 
food here is awesome!!! i love the spicy cucumber cold appetizer and the spicy beef and tripe appetizer  i must get them every time i go  the soup dumplings are delicious and come out much quicker than at other soup dumpling restaurants  also the crispy noodles are very tasty  overall you can't go wrong with any dish  everything is inexpensive and worth the price  only downside is they only accept cash!!! and expect a wait but they have expanded so more table space 
we were super excited to try this place after seeing the great reviews on yelp and all the pictures  figured it would be a long wait as restaurant was packed and long line of people waiting outside  but only took 10 minutes  thankfully food was pretty good for the most part the scallion pancake with beef  phenomenal  a must try and probably the only reason i would return  fried dough   we each had a bite and didn't want more upon noodles with beef  noms  would order again pork xlb  these took forever to get out and by that time  i was stuffed  they have good flavor but they are heavier than ones i have had anywhere else  pork & crab xlb  so much crab  so worth it  again i was stuffed by the time this came out   next time will order these first before everything else  i usually don't care for the crab soup dumplings because it tastes the same as regular  but here you can definitely  taste the difference  we won't order the regular pork ones next time  service was atrocious  it took a good 10 minutes before we were served tea after we sat down  we asked for water three times (with different people) over maybe the course of 30 minutes as we were super patient and were told "wait a minute" in an annoyed tone each time  by the third time  i was just annoyed myself and said this is my third time asking and finally someone brought it  unacceptable  the frustrating part is that we asked for a water and a coke at the same time and they brought out the coke immediately but took us half an hour and multiple inquiries to get the water 
the food menu is limited so i get pretty much the same thing i order everytime i go  the food and beer prices are very affortable  i always get pork soup dumpling  beef cripsy crepe  and either chicken or beef rice cake  fried rice cake with chicken or beef is a bit on the oily side   they have tsing tao  corona and budweiser for beer selection  i would never drink their tea or water offered    not clean  bring your water bottle please  unless  you have no option 
cash only!!!!service was surprisingly good for an asian restaurant    i'm not sure if this is the norm in new york  but in houston  you only see your server once and you often have to flag them down to get water   check   etc  sometimes  you may even have to do all of those yourself  our water was constantly kept full and the server was very attentive and took our orders immediately  now to the food   scallion pancake with beef and hoisin sauce    dude  i'm craving this so badly right now  i may even be drooling  this was so good!!!! it was so crispy and the beef super chewy and delicious  i would go back just for this i also liked the rice pancakes  but my so said he has had better    this was my first time trying these  so i really had nothing else to compare it to the xiao long bao was also very delicious!!!overall  these were big portions for a very good price! the only "bad" thing is that they are cash only  however  the servers speak english and they are super attentive and the food is great  5 stars! can't wait to come back!
delicious pork soup dumplings  better than din tai fung  must try if you like soup dumplings 
wait wasn't bad   supposedly 10 minute wait   they forgot about us and never called our number   we mentioned it to them and they fixed it right away   service was ok i liked the crab pork xiao long bao more than the pork xiao long bao   my friends stated the xiao long baos have less crab this time   spicy beef with tripe was good  cold  and tender   the tripe was so tender that it fell apart when we bit into it  the spicy oil temporarily left our tongue numb   the pan fried dumplings were good 
this place is definitely overhyped  the soup dumplings are too thick and the staff is rude and unfriendly  the last time i ate here the staff kept staring at me and gave me dirty looks 
best soup dumplings in nyc  imo  been to a few around queens city and must say their soup broth is amazing    cash only!  can get packed on the weekends  cheap as hell  soup dumplings are about $6 i believe for the pork ones  asides from their soup dumplings  i would recommend the scallion pancake (with beef or without)  shanghai udon noodles  rice cakes  fried dumplings   beers are cheap  $3 50 for a tsingtao  food comes out relatively quick  on my recent visit noticed that they are open late on weekends (1 am)  might be new hours  i don't recall them being open that late previously
best dumplings i have ever had!   took two stars off because of the crowded feel of the tables and the place is really hard to find  pro tip   pork dumplings and scallion pancakes    also  parking is available in a lot hidden behind the church   i believe it's a paid parking lot 
limited menu  cash only  but decent xiao long bao  small disclaimer  i was born in china  but i consider myself a die hard fan of the drier baozi filling in beijing as opposed to the soupy goodness in xiao long bao  however  i must yield when i eat authentic chinese food as the restaurant proudly displays  nan xiang xiao long bao is a michelin recognized restaurant and their signature dish is the xiao long bao  there are two major options  ones with crabmeat and one without  to be perfectly  perfectly  honest  they both taste the same  except one looks prettier with the golden sprinkles  as for the other dishes  we tried the fried tofu curd (which cost around $8 10  but honestly tasted no different from the ones in $2 cans)  the fried dough  and the assortment of pig ears and tendons  those pig ears and tendons were cut so thinly that we could see each other across the cartilagenous goodness  although  i'm more of a thicker cut kinda guy  the soymilk is true soymilk  not the silly commercially available ones in the store  this is the good stuff  we ended up ordering additional scallion pancakes  which took forever to arrive  and at the end  we kinda regretted it because it was definitely one of the greasiest items and was cooked with enough lard to make my cardiologist blush  at the end of the day  it's good xiao long bao  probably some of the better ones outside of boston  i'd recommend it  and it's fun to watch to chefs make them in action! parking however  is a big pain in the buttocks 
this is a cash only restaurant  go figure since the restaurant's name isn't even in english  and like any chinese restaurant  they immediately serve hot tea as you're seated  needless to say  their soup dumplings and noodles are da bomb! i suppose there's a reason for the superbly high rating  the shanghai shao mai  which comes in 4 pieces  were pretty interesting  i don't recall having rice inside at other places i've been to  it was good  don't get me wrong the steamed pork bun that comes with 6 was the best soup dumpling ever! the soup was just super good  i remember thinking to myself  "man  this is really yummy " it's rare that i have these wowing moments when i take a bite out of something  plus  the reviews on here rave about it as well the dried noodle with beef & shredded pepper (under the noodle soup section  weird  i know) was seriously delicious! i'm a total noodle lover  and this was a maz ing! the significant other also agreed even though he tries to stay away from carbs  the ratio of noodles  sauce  meat  and veggies were just right  they didn't over do the oil base bc i've had similar dishes where it's just unbearably oily at the bottom  nan xiang xiao long bao is located in chinatown btw 
the name is evocative of a casual eatery in shanghai that is all but mediocre to the old of shanghai  and appropriated here by a spot that is not totally shanghainese  and surely not actually related to the original?we got sticky rice cakes with mustard green  scallion pancakes with beef filling  and vegetable dumplings i didn't love the texture of the rice cakes and the excess of grease and the visible charred pieces of rice cake  that's not how you do it  but it was okay beef in scallion pancakes tasted like peking duck sauce on bland scallion pancakes with some slices of beef and green onion  you're supposed to salt the pancakes too!!!vegetarian dumplings seemed remotely relevant to shanghai  reimagined as chinese cuisine is hardly ever vegetarian  i appreciated that they were filled completely and purely with shepherd's purse  a quintessential shanghainese vegetable (or a weed is it?) hot soy milk was good too but came in a plastic bowl with the chinese print that is traditional on ceramic bowls  ceramic bowls would be safer  both in terms of bpa leaching and the waiter accidentally spilling because bowl is too light service isn't too professional no refills for tea  cash only and short change you by a few cents  probably makes a good amount of money doing this to every party  waitstaff bickering about how to split tips loudly in the eating area  and bowls and spoons aren't too clean don't get tap water here  it smells like the bathroom  definitely get hot tea overall kind of whatever mediocre but not sure where else in the vicinity of nyc to find this food so i'll be back the food here is evocative of food i've had in the past and is just a shadow of what could be that just momentarily fills the void    
definitely one of the best places for xiao long baos  the soup dumplings are made fresh when ordered so expect a 10 15 minute wait for the buns  i ate at other shanghai places for xiao long baos but i keep coming back to this one  especially when i am in flushing  it's fresh and the soup in the buns are full of flavor  we ordered the pork soup dumplings and a scallion pancake with sliced beef  the scallion pancake with sliced beef is a great appetizer  even though it came after the soup dumplings  it's a scallion pancake wrapped with a good amount of sliced beef with shreds of scallion and hoisin sauce  it's a mixture of sweet and savory and the sauce isn't too overwhelming  my boyfriend and i only come here for the soup dumplings  we had their shanghai lo mein before but it wasn't that's good  super oily and they do not give that much either  the place is old fashioned and we had dirty tea cups for a couple of times now  but they didn't mind when we asked to switch our cups  service isn't the best but isn't horrible 
this is your authentic chinese restaurant if you're looking for one  the entrance room looks really small and it's as if you can't fit a lot of people but they have two rooms off to the size to accommodate people  service was average (pretty above average for a chinese place honestly) food came out pretty quickly and it was delicious  portion sizes for the entrees were smaller than expected but the appetizers were larger than i expected  overall i had a really good experience here!
really good soup dumplings  but not the best in flushing  the side dishes are all pretty good as well   shanghai stir fried noodles was great tasting but really greasy  but rude service  kinda dirty interior and tables makes me not want to go back  and cash only! sure michelin gave you a nod  but i think you need to step your game up a bit 
visited this place yet again! couldn't resist not passing up great soup dumplings in ny  we had some time to eat so my friend and i decided to eat some hot pork soup dumplings before we leave  definitely delicious on cold days  coming in a bit before lunch time it got crowded with a 10 25 minute wait depending on the size of your party  we had 6  we ordered about 5 rounds of soup dumplings  noodles  tripe  fried dough and 3 bowls of warm soy milk  since it was crowded  they had forgotten our other 4 rounds of soup dumplings  anyways  the star of the show were the soup dumplings  they come out steaming hot and juicy  there is no particular way of eating them  just as long as you don't lose the soup! there are silver tongs provided to lift them out  the only reason for 3 stars is because of the longer wait time than expected  our tea cups had some residue on the bottom and that our order was forgotten  we just asked for water cups drank soy milk instead  my first visit didn't have these issues  however  it might be from the place being so crowded  it would have been 4 stars from my first visit    definitely try the fried dough dipped in their warm soy milk! the place is a bit small especially with it being on a busy weekend  when i went here a while back  we came in on a weekday and not around lunch time  it was nearly empty so we had no trouble  this place only accepts cash  so please come prepared  other than that  if you are in the area  try it out!
the steam soup buns are great and deserve a 4 star  but the service is terrible  long line on the weekend 
came here with a few friends as we really wanted some soup dumplings  the restaurant has a good amount of seating  as expected  another asian restaurant with not so great service  took forever to get someone to refill out tea and get other items  here are the items we got   fried bun with chives  not bad  but nothing special  scallion pancake  was crispy and a good amount of scallions  not thick and not too oily  pan fried pork buns  wasn't a fan of this  the meat wasn't too tasty and buns were thick  braised beef noodle soup  this soup was very odd tasting  not your normal beef noodle soup  the noodles were okay  though   soy milk  i enjoyed this!  pork xlb  the xlb are so large here  the soup is pretty good inside of them but the skin is a bit thick for my taste  the meat inside is okay   crab meat and pork xlb  this xlb tasted funny to me  i did not enjoy the added crab meat overall  food here is not bad  i would come if i was really craving for this 
pretty easy to get to from the 7 subway once you get to the main st stop  on a saturday morning  walked in and got a table pretty quickly   got the traditional black tea which treated my throat well on brisk morning   decided on shanghai pan fried u don noodles and one of the crispy dough breads   i was extremely satisfied with the price of food and what i got out of it   the u don noodles were cooked to what felt like perfection and i loved the sautéed veggies   if you have ever had fried dough  its a middle eastern dessert breakfast food where you will make dough which gets stretched out  fried and coated in sugar   the dough tasted similar to these  just without the sugar which i think would've been a great addition because i just ate oily bread  i mean it was still good bread but it would have added another element of flavor to it   service  they treated me exactly what i expected of them  i thought they would seat me(check)  bring me my food out in a timely manner(check) and refill my tea water if i asked them(check)  i have been to other asian restaurants and they are not typically known for the greatest service but if you have the expectations that i have  you will be happy with it overall  great u don noodles if i am ever in flushing again for what feels like an appropriate price 
finally got to try this spot! everyone talks about the infamous soup dumplings    well at least one person did we had the beef scallion pancakes  soup dumplings  and fried dumplings  the beef scallion pancakes were a1  i could've easily ate two orders alone  the fried dumplings were so crispy and full of meat  honestly the soup dumplings were mediocre  i think my expectations were too high  still good though overall  great food  chill spot  and affordable prices 
at lunch time this place gets packed  even during the week  tables near the door are crowded by people waiting for a seat  the soup dumplings are amazing  i'm rarely impressed by crab xiaolongbao  but these were delicious  as were the pork  definitely my go to place in flushing for xiaolongbao 
i know  these are supposed to be the best soup dumplings in the area  but i've come twice already and still find them to be just okay  i love me a good soup dumpling and these are good  but they aren't the best  regardless  if you're looking to get your fix  this place will definitely do the trick  no frills type of place   expect to share a community table if you're a small party and coming in for dinner  but they're super quick with the orders and everyone is there just to eat and go  your typical flushing restaurant   not the cleanest place  but a good bang for your buck 
i went to this restaurant out of convenience; it was right next to my hotel in flushing  thankfully  this restaurant is also pretty late  even when nearby stores closed  the food here is pretty average  and their menu is rather limited for a chinese restaurant  however  they prepare the food extremely quickly; your entire table's order will literally come out within ten minutes  moreover  it is decently priced and not too expensive! the food would be more enjoyable if it wasn't too ready; we ordered a noodle dish and could literally see the oil dripping down the noodles  other than that  the staff were very attentive and we were in and out of the restaurant within an hour!
i love the authentic food at this place  and i don't use that word often  their soup dumplings  pancakes and cucumber salads are delicious  gets crowded over the weekends 
best dumplings i've ever had  it's always my go to spot for a quick lunch or dinner  prices are great they have a great assortment of soups and noodles too 
out of all the xiaolongbaos i've eaten  these were the best  filled with broth and pork covered by a thick coat of skin  these xiaolongbaos filled me up  if you go flushing  nan xiang xiao long bao is the place to go!
stopped by with my friend around noon wednesday for some dimsum and overall i was not disappointed  seating was prompt and menu was simple  waiter couldn't quite speak english so he couldn't answer us when i asked whether they have any vegetable dish of the day (chinese people usually ask and restaurants can usually make something up)  we ended up just going with the soy peas  cabbage  and shredded bean curd dish  along with pork & crab xlb  and seafood crispy noodle  xlb (3 5)   not bad  thin skin and good  hot broth that was not overly greasy  but it was not spectacular like some other joints like having incredibly sweet and savory crab meat or having extremely thin skin  soy peas and bean curd dish (4 5)   strangely addictive  it's just mild and savory but was a great compliment to the soup dumpling seafood crispy noodle (5 5)   this one actually stole the show  it was perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of thickness in the soup  with lively seafood ingredients that weren't rubbery and limp  on top of fresh crispy noodles  i think we licked the plate clean and could've had another round if not for our self control  and as with any ny area chinese restaurant  i also rate cleanliness of bathrooms for you guys and  it was surprisingly clean in the men's  check came pretty quickly and there was no nasty attitude given for chatting up and having a leisurely lunch  i would likely explore other dimsum places around here for sure  but would stop by again if i can't find any other places of interest 
absolutely one of my favorite spots for soup dumplings! nan xiang is known for their soup dumplings and rightfully so  i try to make the effort to come here every time i'm in flushing because the food is so good and the price can't be beat  if you come in the early morning  there is no wait but if you come during the lunch time   there is quite a bit of a wait  they have so much selection but i always find myself ordering the pork soup dumplings (even if it's early am   because really   i can eat these any time of the day)  soy milk and beef scallion pancakes  the soup dumplings are prepared and cooked to perfection  you can see the ladies preparing them on the side and behind the front desk  the meat in the soup dumpling is flavorful  tender and juicy  the skin is just the perfect texture   not too thin  not too thick and they don't break easily like other restaurants  i've enjoyed everything i've tried and haven't had a bad experience with the service at all  the staff is efficient in getting your food at a reasonable time  fyi cash only 
my go to place for soup dumplings in flushing! its tasty  filling and affordable  what more could you ask for? (cash only btw)  they have been consistent throughout the years  but my most recent visit sent me running to the hills (or in my case  the restroom)  our group of six arrived on a weekday and we were seated immediately  which is great because there's usually a bit of a wait  we all ordered pork soup dumplings ($5 95)  an order of pan fried dumplings ($6 50)  pan fried udon ($6 95)  and the popular scallion pancake with beef ($4 95)  the soup dumplings were great  the first bite when you break into the soup dumpling and sip on the soup is phenomenal  the skin isn't too thick  broth and pork was so flavorful  i always pour some vinegar on the top of the dumpling  and it just ties everything together so perfectly  the scallion pancake with beef is definitely an appetizer to share with another person  it's scallion pancake wrapped around beef with the sweet sauce they use in the peking duck buns  with pieces of scallions  it's very crispy and tasty but it's a little on the salty oily side  so it does turn some people off  my only complaint for this visit was the pan fried udon noodles  the noodles were cold and rubbery when it arrived to the table  the sauce was already clumping together  on top of that  we found a strand of hair on the top while transferring the noodles to our plates  we decided to ignore that because mistakes happen  a minute later  we see two more strands of long hair which is just disgusting  we called the waiters over and informed them of the hairs in the noodles  the waiter was unapologetic and just asked us in a very monotone voice if we wanted another one  when we responded yes  he just lifted the dish from the table and walked away without saying anything  another waiter dropped off the new pan fried udon noodles a couple minutes later  i would love to return but please wear hairnets to prevent this from happening again to us or other customers 
i've come to this restaurant a couple of times now and every time it's been completely crowded and we always have to wait for a seat  the most recent time i came was on a saturday afternoon around 3 pm  due to the time i wasn't expecting a completely full restaurant but i was wrong  i came in with a group of 10 and we waited around 20 30 minutes outside for our table which wasn't too bad  when we went in the server came out to get our food order quickly and delivered it right away  service itself was expected for a busy chinese restaurant in flushing  so it was just ok  we ordered a big array of food to share with the table we got fried bean gluten  spicy beef and tripe  rice cakes  fried noodles  pork and cabbage dumplings  scallion pancake and scallion pancake with beef  we also got hot sweet soy milk to share  fried bean gluten  i love the taste of kao fu and am always happy to have some but the flavor is hard to always get right  however  this dish was great and we even got an extra order of it for the table! spicy beef and tripe  really good as well  flavor really helped to compliment the meat and tripe  rice cakes  i'm usually not a big fan of rice cakes but this one was well cooked and the mixture of the veggies with it was good as well! fried noodles  the fried noodles were yummy  the veggies in the dish were well cooked and really complemented the dish  dumplings   the dumplings were just ok nothing about it really stood out  scallion pancake  great scallion pancake! scallion pancake with beef  was disappointed with this one  the beef flavor was just ok  not really the best  a bit too sweet from what i was expecting  the restaurant itself was also not the cleanest but the food for the most part (apart from a couple dishes ) were delicious and well worth the journey in from the city!
after trying this and joe's shanghai back to back  i can confidently say this one is better wait  came a few times  both with waits about 20 30 minutes   it looks long but if you have 2 people  it's never too long because the tables turn fast   you might want to stick around for them to call your number because it moves so quickly atmosphere  typical chinese restaurant  nothing fancy  wooden tables and chairs all crammed into the restaurant   there are 2 sides of the restaurant plus a back area so they can actually fit a good amount of people   i believe it is cash only so beware of that food  obviously people come here for the xlb   my other favorite dish is the rice cake with pork and preserved vegetable   xlb   what makes these xlb great are the skins   they are delicate  soft  slightly chewy and thicker than the ones at other places like joe's shanghai   they are on the "smaller" side but i think that's what helps keep the skin in tact and not break and also gives it that great flavor   there is not quite as much juice as joe's and it's probably a little less oily and intense  but still good   the pork are great  have good flavor and are tasty rice cake with preserved vegetable and pork   not sure what it's called in english exactly but it's pictured on the menu   i'm used to the ones from other shanghainese restaurants with a brown like gravy but this one actually has no sauce   rice cakes are oval shaped thin rice "noodles" or "patties" that are also known as "dduk" in korean   they are chewy and tasty and my favorite   this dish isn't overwhelming with sauce and is cooked simply with the pork and preserved vegetable  which resembles a type of mustard   it's green and slightly salty sauteed   kind of like sautéed pea sprouts   very good and tasty  my favorite dish to get when we go other than that  the green onion pancakes are good and i've seen people get the chasew bao type buns that are lightly pan fried at the bottom overall  i would definitely recommend coming here when in flushing 
recommend if you're in the area for a filling meal at a decent price!the most memorable parts of our meal were the chive & egg pancakes and soup dumplings  and if i had to choose between the two  i'd pick the chive & egg pancakes! it was crispy  but didn't feel too oily  sorta like an empanada stuffed with veggies & some egg and vermicelli waiter was slow to take away our finished dishes and didn't refill our tea (maybe once at the beginning and that was it)  it was also hard to flag her down at the end of our meal to get the check  also  since we sat near the back kitchen  we saw them microwaving something inside a ceramic bowl   a soup? and then serving it to the next table over    so i don't recommend ordering that if you are skeeved out by microwave use in a restaurant overall  we had a decent meal and the price made it a good deal  cash only!
i think this was one of the best meal we had in the east coast! went here with my cousins and husband for dinner  thankfully it wasn't busy at all so we were seated right away  we ordered some xlb  omg  it was soooo friggenn soupyyyyy and yummy! the soupiest xlb i've ever had  lol hands down it beats dtf dumplings  we also got the pancakes which was ok   parking can be hard to find  but we got lucky with street parking  cash only 
the nanxiang soup dumplings are always amazing  i love the soup and the texture of meat 
some people say nan xiang is overrated but for price  consistency  and convenience  this is one of the better places for xiaolongbao and chinese snacks  recommend the xiaolongbao (both signature and with crab)  the beef scallion pancake  the spicy beef and tripe  and the rice cake with shredded pork  skip the soup noodles in general   there are much better places in flushing if that's what your craving (go to the food courts) there's often a line but it moves quickly  service is not amazing (you definitely have to be assertive to get the servers' attention) 
i stand by my words when i say that the xlbs here are some of the best i've had  if anything  they are definitely worth the trek out to flushing because they are way cheaper and way better than the ones you find in manhattan our party of two arrived around 11 and were seated immediately (this was not the case for parties that arrived around the time we were leaving   around 12pm)  we ordered one basket of soup dumplings and a bowl of beef noodle soup  they were already sold out of the brisket  so we ended up getting the spicy beef noodle soup sans chili oil   the soup dumplings really held up their shape  and none of them ripped as we transferred them to our spoons  they were also full of delicious broth that wasn't too gelatinous or too watered down  they did take a while longer than most other items to prepare  i noticed that tables that only ordered dumplings had to wait a long time before they arrived  thankfully  we were able to get a start on our noodle soup as we waited for the dumplings  we really enjoyed the chewiness of the noodles and the heartiness of the beef broth  it was definitely a good choice for what started out as a chilly morning! for $15  we had a very satisfying meal for two!personally  i didn't have an issue with the attitude of the servers  if the food is good and service is efficient  i am sold!
my favorite shanghainese restaurant in queens  i usually order the xiao long baos ( both the crab and regular one)  last night i tried the beef scallion pancake and it was amazing! the pancake was crispy  the beef was tender and they used hoisin sauce which made it sweet  i love their warm soy milk  some people prefer cold soy milk but it taste much better when it's warm 
the table of four next to us stiffed their servers  "no tip " the customers said  "because we had to ask for water  and we didn't have spoons " are you kidding me  cheap o tourists? do you understand what was just given to you? you just got a group meal of some of the best xiao long baos in nyc for under $40 and now you don't want to tip? that's like someone giving you a pirate's treasure chest full of gold and you're mad because they didn't smile  the servers put diamonds on your plate and served them to you at $6 50 a pop  and you're mad you didn't get spoons? eat those diamonds with your hands  you sillies  also  just think about it  these servers bring these hot and steamy trays of delicious pork soup dumplings to your table without burning themselves or you in the process  and a 10% tip is just $0 65 per tray  that's the least you could do  i mean  i always tip at least 20% because i'm classy like that  at joints like this  the food is so cheap  it's another $4 to make it 20%; the servers are working for pennies here  nan xiang is my favorite place to get pork dumplings in nyc  there  i said it  nowhere in manhattan can you get this quality of dumplings for the price  the delicate  perfectly balanced noodle skins wrap the juicy pork that is just loaded with savory soup  (no  they're not as good as din tai fung  but they are not far off)  the green onion pancake is just okay  a little too deep fried for my taste  it's better with the beef in it  because it balances out the fried crispy texture  the garlic cucumbers are good and refreshing  the pork and pickled cabbage noodle soup was good  but probably needed more pork and less cabbage  broth and noodles were nice though  the beef noodle soup and the soy milk are all just okay  nothing spectacular  but can definitely satisfy a craving  skip  jellyfish (mostly has other veggies to compensate for not having enough jellyfish) so  just to recap  don't expect good service  don't expect them to bring bowls with your soup  but  expect soup dumplings that warm your heart (and are pretty easy on your wallet!)
been here two times and both times loved it!as my first and most recent soup dumpling experience  i know and see why this place has over 2k reviews! usually there can be a wait during regular meal times  but the location is so big that it's very fast and you don't have to wait long  food  5always always always perfect and delicious and fresh  the the size of the dumplings are great  adn the pancakes are also very big and stuffed! i love this place because of the food  that's it  come here from xiao long baos and you won't be disappointed service  4can't always be great because the servers are running around everywhere  but they are very quick and good at their job  wouldn't hurt to come around a bit more often with those water pitchers though ambiance  5it's your typical asian restaurant  it'll be chaos and food smelling all the time  be thankful you have a seat and some food to eat 
big fan of this place! time and time again  nan xiang is not only the best soup dumpling restaurant of the five boroughs  but they are always consistent with their food  big caveat  the wait times can be awful  for about three people   this is my usual order  2 orders of the crab and pork soup dumplings  beef tripe  soy milk  scallion pancakes  and some noodle dish (ie the crispy noodles)  the crab and pork dumplings are their specialty   you can't go wrong with them  the soy milk is my favorite drink here  it's served warm in a bowl  and slightly sweet  wish they sold this at grocery stores in manhattan  the beef tripe is my favorite dish at nan xiang  there are other places in flushing and chinatown where they do beef tripe  but it's never the same as nan xiang  their seasoning for it is absolutely delicious  this is a must try! all of this would be about 35 40 dollars (for three people  it's just slightly north of $10 per person)  the only downfall for this place is the wait times and that prices are rising since it's becoming so popular  a lot of people on yelp complain about nan xiang for their service  but it's an authentic chinese spot  their service is never going to be good  accept that  judge this place (and most authentic foreign places) on their food  not their service 
one of my favorite breakfast brunch spots in flushing  the crab  pork soup dumplings are amazing and i keep coming back for more  i also highly recommend the savory bean curd  the fried noodles as well as the scallion pancakes 
came for the famous soup dumplings which were very juicy and the skin was thin  noddle dishes were about average 
i love this place for soup dumplings and more! the food is delicious and the price is reasonable! every time i come here  the food is consistently good  i always come here when my friends or family come into town  just a heads up  the place is cash only  like many places in flushing 
cash only establishment   lines outside the front door  however  took us at most 10min wait  line moves very fast this place several tons of delicious food  their soup dumplings are made fresh by a team of chefs  once you get seated  you are given delicious hot tea  we had their soup dumplings  it took a while for it to come out as they were made fresh  the broth is very delicious and fatty  they also have pan fried soup dumplings  those are very hardy and takes time to finish we also ordered the soymilk  rice cakes and tofu skin  all dishes were good  they also serve beef tendons  bamboo shoots  and pig ears  all those dishes are great for 7 dishes  it cost us less than $30  not too bad  overall  i will come back here again  will probably try their beef dishes and noodle so
surprised to find out that this is a 1 star michelin restaurant! decided to go here and recover after a night of debauchery  i'm convinced there is nothing better than eating soup dumplings asian foods on a rainy day place is cash only so come prepared  we came at an off peak hour so the service was lighting fast  the waiters aren't exactly the friendliest  but i think this curt service is pretty standard and expected in chinatown and flushing  food is really cheap and allows for your party to order "family style" without breaking the bank  menu is not large but has just enough to satisfy all your cravings  we opted for the soup dumplings  bean curd gluten  udon noodles  and soy milk with the toasted bread  i'm not a huge soup dumpling person in general so i didn't really care but my friends absolutely loved it  i really enjoyed the bean curd and udon  i would definitely love to come back and try some of their other dishes as it was already sold out by the time we came 
this is the best place to get soup dumplings hands down  the soup is the best in town!
no doubt the best soup dumplings in new york! i only discovered nan xiang a few years ago  but omg this place is amazing  and totally deserving to be on the michelin guide the soup dumplings here are perfection  the skin is the perfect thickness   not too thick that it tastes doughy  but not too thin that it breaks the moment you pick it up  the filling inside is so juicy and flavorful  and there is so much soup inside! i always get the crab and pork soup dumplings   i think it has that extra flavor which makes it better than the pork alone  other soup dumplings places seem to either mess up the wrapper  the soup  or the filling  but nan xiang has perfected every single element of their soup dumplings the other items on their menu are quite good as well  i'm a big fan of the shanghai fried udon  i normally wouldn't order this dish  but my friend got it once and i am now converted  it is a bit oily  but it is not overwhelmingly flavorful or saucy  even better are the cold appetizers; my favorite is the fried bean curd  i can't really describe what it is  but you totally have to try it out  the tripe and pig ears are good also  but not too different from other places i am not crazy about the scallion pancakes that everyone else seems to love  it just tastes like an oily mess in my opinion  but the vinegar helps to cut through that i usually come at weird hours so i rarely have to wait   the only time i waited was during a weekend for lunch which is totally understandable  service is prompt  and this is cash only so make sure you have some bills on you 
the food here taste delicious  but i wouldn't recommend coming here in big groups or on the weekends  it gets super crazy on the weekends with the line out the door  if you want to try it  come here in the afternoon  although  the afternoon doesn't taste as good as the mornings pork soup dumpling 6 ($6 50) i loveee the soup dumplings here  i think out of all the dim sum places  the soup dumpling is spectacular pan fried dumpling 6 ($6 50)  this was not that worth it  i think if you went to a 4 for $1 place  it would be so much better spicy beef & tripe ($8 95)  it was seasoned and done right  definitely have to try it if you come here  scallion pancake w  sliced beef ($4 95)  i love love love this! the pancake was hot  crispy and savory!! all in one  the beef almost taste like the peking duck bao  iced soy milk  not to sweet and very cute  they sell a lot of this and they have cute prints on the lid don't expect to really get that great of a service at any asian restaurant  they are cash only! when your in any of the three chinatown  always remember to bring cash  more than likely  they will not take card 
after coming here  i now know why this place is very popular  the wait is pretty long especially during the weekend  you can see waiters and waitresses rushing back and forth with sweat on their brows while attending the customers their food is amazing  so fresh and so delicious  from dim sum to regular meal dishes  the quality of their food is superb!  their prices are very reasonable for their quality  definitely come try this place out  but if you come during weekends  expect the shop to be overly crowded  loud with hectic waiters and waitresses running around 
nan xiang has a small and simple menu  but are good at what they make  it's been been around for a long time and due to the overwhelming business  they've expanded to three rooms (they'll start closing down the third room when it is nearing closing time)  the line can get pretty long during peak hours since it is a touristy spot  but it should move rather quickly  when you arrive  you'll be given a number (most people choose to wait outside) my favorites are   pork soup dumplings  beef scallion pancake  fried dumplings  kao fu (from cold appetizers)  jellyfish (from cold appetizers)these two dishes are good as well  but i order it moderately because it can be a bit too oily for me   fried ricecakes  seafood crispy noodleprices are pretty affordable! there is a public parking lot across the street  but it gets extremely crowded  if you drive then you're better off parking at skyview mall a couple blocks away for $3  for 3 hours with incremental increases 
delish xlb in flushing!!  the xlb were big and filled with soup   we tried the pork xlb  pork and crab xlb  pan fried pork buns  ans shanghai shao mai   definitely get the xlb   would skip the shanghai shao mai (they were basically sticky rice wrapped in the dumpling wrapper  instead of the traditional leaf)   service was slow non existent  though   expect to flag them down for everything 
great food  not to be missed  soup dumplings are top notch  scallion pancakes are lightly fried and delicious and the cucumber  garlic  cilantro salad is terrific too (but  not if on a date!)  had another type of dumpling also  very good  worth the wait (most times you'll wait to get a seat) 
my friend recommended this place  wait was upward of 25 30min for a saturday lunch  reminded me slightly of din tai fung  except dishes were saltier than desired  make sure to order the xiao long bao (duh!) and scallion pancake with beef   both were exceptionally delicious and the highlights of our meal  the scallion pancake  albeit slightly greasier than desired  was crispy  and the meat was tender and greatly enhanced the dish by providing a textural gradient  the xlb was fresh (the ladies in the front of the store can be seen making it) and the broth was sweet and savory  mmmmmm! we also ordered a lomein  soybean milk soup with fried dough  and this other fried dough dish wrapped in rice (frankly this last dish reminded me of a sex toy); all these dishes were quite standard mundane  saltier than i desired  and left me chugging tea non stop  the total? quite affordable; worked out to be approximately $30 40 for 3 people  overall  would definitely recommend coming to this place to check out the fresh xlb and scallion pancake; i can't say the same for the other dishes  glad i stopped by  and would probably return for the two dishes mentioned!
i always stop by here when i'm visiting flushing!def order the soup dumplings  they do it right  and at an affordable price  there's not been a long wait each time i've come  i'd also suggest the big chive fried dumping i would not suggest to get the savory (salty) soybean milk  it's just sweet soybean milk with added salt  i would love to have had it with the small dried shrimp  or green onions  or pickled veggies  or pork rinds  or sesame oil    any of those  but it was just plain with salt still a hit! i'd def suggest giving this place a visit!
probably the best xlb i've ever had in nyc  way better than restaurants in chinatown manhattan but idk how it compares to others in flushing though  the sticky rice shu mai  garlic cucumber and boiled chicken were also tasty!! i'd come back the next time i'm in flushing 
this is probably the best xlb i've had so far  i can't decide if i like the pork or the one with crab  both so good  they come out so  so hot! i don't know how they get so much soup in there  the soup is wonderfully rich  like joe's used to be  you can probably get at least three spoonfuls so you'll need to take a bite off the top and pour the soup slowly into the spoon  the skin is thick enough so it doesn't break but not too thick  i also like the bean curd soy bean cold appetizer and the scallion pancake  this will definitely be my go to place when in nyc 
the lost star was mostly from the subpar service  the food  so of course we usually order soup dumplings when we go here  compared to a few other places i have tried soup dumplings at i liked this place better (however i am still exploring and trying to find the perfect soup dumpling place)  i personally like the slices of ginger that come on the side  which i think adds some flavor to a somewhat bland dish  would recommend putting the dumpling on the spoon to catch the soup that bursts out when you bite into it  besides the soup dumplings i've tried a few of their cold dishes like the spicy beef tendon  spicy beef and tripe and the sliced pig ears with spicy sauce  nothing mind blowing here atmosphere  no special decorations  just  typical chinatown decor that looks somewhat like a cafeteria  service  well   they forgot my friend's order altogether so that's not so good  we got tired of waiting for that dish and left 
loved this place  the soup dumplings were phenomenal!! i would take the trip from jersey just for this  the sweet sticky rice  and the thin fried noodles  the service could be better  but the food speaks for itself  you can tell there's love going into those delicious dumplings 
truth be told  i'm not a big fan of chinese food   it's ironic since i'm chinese american   my girlfriend decided where to eat that night and she chose the popular "nan xiang xiao long bao"  it may be a popular restaurant to get great dimsum dishes but it was a little too oily for my tastes   i ordered 1  vegetable noodle soup  2   pork xiao long bao3  beef scallion pancakes4  shanghai pan fried noodles5  sticky rice mushroom shumai   i thoroughly enjoyed the vegetable noodle soup the most   even despite not having having any meats in there  it still became my favorite dish there   it didn't need much else since the broth had great flavor already   it was also not very oily which was a huge plus   the pork xiao long baos were delicious as always   you really can't go wrong with that one   the beef scallion pancakes was pretty good   it was thinly sliced beef with drizzled hoisin oyster sauce wrapped within a scallion pancakes   the shanghai pan fried noodles was decent with shredded pork  chinese veggies  and thick noodles   unfortunately  it was a little oily for my preferences  my least favorite and most disappointed dish had to be the sticky rice mushroom shumai   whenever i was young  i'd become ecstatic when i'd get to try this dish that i had no idea what it was called   it was so good that i'd buy these from chinese supermarkets and make it myself in my kitchen   it would taste great when i would steam it and eat it   unfortunately for nan xiang  it was the most dry tasting shumai i have ever tasted   a huge disappointment since i edified it to my girlfriend as something that i loved to eat 
we tried a bunch of dishes here  spicy beef noodle (this could have been spicier) dumplings  buns  sesame pancake  everything was really good and service was great as well  will be back next time were in the big apple 
heard this place was a tourist trap  but my friend and i wanted to check it out anyway  we ordered the pork soup dumplings  cucumber with garlic  and scallion pancakes with beef  honestly  they were all pretty decent and had good flavor; also hot and freshly made  only reason i'm giving it 4 stars is because i've had better of the same at other shanghai nese restaurants  basically a bit more crispiness  a bit more complexity in flavor  and a bit of improvement in presentation would have been a 5 star tourist trap? maybe  but still decent 
i was in new york for work  and someone from the office recommended me to come to this place  i never carry cash on me and when i first got to the restaurant there were signs posted everywhere saying "cash only" i wanted to try the food so bad that i immediately went on a hunt for an atm  20 dollars can go a long way here! i ended up getting 4 different orders and they were all amazing! be careful everything comes out blazing hot and you may want to dig in right away  but you will burn your mouth off!
my favorite place ever to get soup dumplings  i have tried many different soup buns from many different places and there is nowhere that is as good or affordable as nan xiang xiao long bao  the place can get busy and is pretty much a no frills type of restaurant but i don't come here for any of that  i come here for the best soup buns! and the scallion pancakes too
my friends and i visited nan xiang xiao long bao in flushing after exploring nyc all day  and had a great experience  the interior is warm and well lit  with ample seating and a bustling staff  two of my friends had been here before  and suggested we order scallion pancakes for appetizers and the crispy dough (my girlfriend and i didn't want to fill up before visiting a dessert place)  our waitress was polite  if a bit rushed  and quickly put in our orders  the scallion pancakes came out first  and they were delicious (the perfect mix of flaky and savory)  the crispy dough quickly followed afterward  and tasted like a thicker version of classic funnel cake  what really impressed me was how inexpensive everything was; we barely paid $10 for so much quality food! that being said  be aware that this place is cash only; make sure to snag some bills before dining  overall  i highly recommend visiting this restaurant for a group dinner  since its food quality  convenience and pricing are impressive!
this is not the place for atmosphere or service  but after my first service i'm certain to return to check out the various dumplings and noodles  the pork and vegetable wonton in spicy sauce and peanut sauce was predictably top notch  but the bigger revelation was the shockingly good fried bun with chive and egg  i didn't expect this much flavor or juiciness from such a simple sounding inexpensive item 
quality of the restaurant differs from time  today i went there i could barely finish a order of their soup dumplings i can usually finish two orders easy  customer service is ok at time and other times are below standard  best dish here is the soup dumplings and good soy bean milk
nan xiang xiao long bao has always been my favorite shanghainese restaurant in flushing  located on prince street next to many restaurants  the space is average size  and always busy so expect to wait for a table  fear not  the wait will be worth it! shanghai is known for their xiao long bao  which is soup dumplings  here are my must have  crab pork meat xiao long bao & pork xiao long bao and pan fried udon with beef  love it! also most people recommend the scallion pancake!in terms of service  it is average could be better  it is always busy and everything is a rush for them therefore  just waving down a waiter will take some time  i love the xiao long bao here better than joe's shanghai  therefore this will always be my go to spot whenever i am in the mood 
where do i even start  the service was fantastic  very kind staff  yes they know english  and very informative  prices are very good  and for the star of the show  the food  this has to be one of the best shanghainese style restaurants i've been to in a very long while  the food is so good  had the soup dumplings and they are out of this world  also had the shanghai shu mai(forgive me if i spelled it wrong) and other dishes as well  i had 0 complaints for the food  the complementary tea is also very delishes  i have eaten at many places in flushing and this one by far is my favorite  yes most of the time you may need to wait  but the wait is fairly quick and highly worth it  i will be coming back 
really good stuffed scallion pancakes and xlb   the wait wasn't even that bad  and it wasn't packed to the brim   good soy milk and crullers you tiao worth a visit or three!
i was extremely disapointed  for starters  cash only  and no sign at the door for that  in fact they have a sign that lead you to believe tgat they in fact take cards  now i had to run to the bank and get cash  when i came back it was almost like my waitress forgot i was there  so i waited a long time and i had already ordered before leaving to get the cash  the food came  i got the crab and pork soup dumpling and the scalion pancakes lets break it down  scalion pancake  very good  however for the wrong reason  it is delicious because it is so deep fried that yoi can taste the oil and see it crab pork and soup dumpling  save the fact that i just realized that i do not know how to eat a soup dumpling ( just learned the hard way) the 6 dumplings presented to me were 5 pork and 1 crab and i was very upset at that  if im paying an extra dollar for the crab  holy wow that is one expensive soup dumpling  also it was so hot that it burned me and nobody warned me of that  the service was meh  i was left alone for unescessary amounts of time  when i needed things i needed to flag someone  so  in my opinion  the food is not everything  it tasted good  yes  but to me for the wrong reasons  i think that this place has good potential  however i think what is killing them at this moment if the floor  if the staff was a little more engaged and the food a but more on point theu can have something awesome here  dont get fooled but whatever you read  the experience you will have may let you down big time  so if you come here have very realistic expectations 
how have i not reviewed this place yet?honestly  my go to xlb place  it's probably one of the best places in nyc for xlb  if not the best  food is always consistent  my favorite things to get here are the crab & pork xlb  fried bean gluten and the scallion beef pancakes  it's probably the only things i get from here  i've tried the other things like rice cakes  noodles  etc but those are just mediocre at best  the prices here have raised significantly over the past few years which i am sad about  this use to be the cheap good eats but now it's not so cheap  the prices keep rising  ( why is it that a fried bean gluten is only a couple cents away from an order of xlb? ridiciulous! also  cash only! don't expect the service here to be good  you get your order and that's it  the staff doesn't care about your feelings like most chinese places  i remember the first time i came here  the staff forgot about our food and we waited an hour before they "remembered" that we were there    i would understand if it was busy but we were one of the only customers there  no apology  nothing  over time i've learned to just deal with the horrible service since the food is that good 
10 10 would recommend  pros  great prices  generous portions  great flavors  plenty of seating  fast service cons  literally none i came here around 3pm on a saturday and it was still packed which definitely says how popular this place is! our group of ~10 was seated within 10 minutes and the food came out less than 10 minutes after we ordered  we had the juicy pork buns  rice cakes  and a bunch of other dishes and the bill came out to be $100 flat for the 10 of us and we were all decently full  will definitely be back if i'm ever in flushing!
hands down the best scallion pancakes and soup dumplings i've ever had  the scallion pancakes are chewy in the middle but have a perfect flaky exterior  the flavor is so simple but so good! the soup in the soup dumpling is amazing and then the dough itself is perfect  truly amazing! i also highly recommend the lo mien  the noodles are so fresh  i already want to go back!! it be a must stop every time i go to new york from now on 
great thing i have to say from this place  my mother is very picky when it comes restaurants with asian dishes  she was 1000% happy with the customer service and food 
my friend recommended this restaurant and i glad i was able to try it out! i was told this place gets pretty busy and that you will have to wait in a long line  so my friends and i purposely went in later at around 8 30pm and got seated right away! we ordered the beef scallion roll  the pork soup dumpling  the crab soup dumpling  the shanghainese udon  and the beef noodle soup dish  i've been to din tai fung on several occasions  so i had super high expectations for the xiao long bao's here  everything was made super fresh as you can see them make it in front of you  i highly recommend this restaurant if you're craving for some good authentic chinese food in flushing!!
the average wait is 30 to 60 minutes during weekend  the food are very tasty and affordable  the steamed crab meat & pork buns is a must order dish  the dough is very thin but magically able to hold the soup inside 
historical restaurant in flushing  their soup dumplings are bomb  i was born and raised in flushing  and their taste stays the same since when i was little 
this place was a little disappointing  i tried them the other night expecting some really great dumplings based on these reviews  someone told me they were better than " joes shanghai" they were very wrong   in my opinion at least  i love joe's but i was tempted to try these and compare the two  hands down  no comparison  they were in its own category  don't get me wrong i enjoyed them but i kept wanting them to taste like joe's and they fell short   if you want to try this place don't go to joes first because  then you will be as disappointed as i was  scallion pancake with beef was really good though 
wait wasn't too bad (15 mins on a weeknight for a table of 4) and everything came out super fast  also  it's cheap  service kind of sucked but who cares? food is delicious  i shared soup dumplings  scallion pancake with sliced beef and pan fried udon noodles  it was enough food for the 4 of us and i think the damage was around $25  obviously it's a bit of a hike from manhattan  but it's a great spot to eat at before an event at citi field!
we have been visiting this place for many years but yesterday in my take out order my chives pastry had a piece of rubber band in it  disgusted and disappointed we will not be going back 
on a rainy thurs night  my friends and i were having dinner and when they recommended this place  i think "hmmmm i guess i can risk having my tongue burned by a xiao long bao tonight " i usually get so excited by food  i forget to let them cool down first!they told me that this place has gotten so popular  that it's gone from just one store front to now three  i was praying there was no wait  lucky for us  we were seated immediately  my friend recommended the hot soy bean milk and i was thoroughly intrigued  i've never had it hot before and the fact that i was drinking it out of a huge bowl made me want it more  for the three of us  i think we definitely over ordered  the waiter even gave us a weird look but o well  the xiao long bao here was definitely satisfying  full of soup that was perfectly seasoned with a nice exterior bun  i don't know if i was super hungry but the scallion pancake tasted amazing to me  expertly fried without that feeling of oiliness that i sometimes get from other establishments  we also ordered the sauteed udon which was pretty standard  i liked their pan fried pork buns but they were a tad bit oily  i also tried their pan fried pork and chive dumplings which i thought was only mediocre  i prefer the ones from vanessa's dumplings more  overall  it was a super delicious and hearty meal  remember guys   it's cash only 
cheap and tasty we had ordered the crab meat soup dumplings  as well as the scallion rice cakes  both were good  they're generous with portions as well  overall  not bad!
i have always heard that this is the best soup dumpling restaurant in queens  i came here to see if it was or not  when i got there  it was a full house but only needed to wait 15 minutes to be seated  one of the waiter was slightly rude  he wanted rolls his eyes whenever we requested some thing but not a big issue  the soup dumplings on the other hand was great but not the best 
small restaurant with quick service  servers aren't very approachable but the food is phenomenal  the cold beef pancake (forgot what it's really called) is really good and the soup dumplings are delicious! their rice cake is one of the best and the shanghai fried noodle and flat noodles are also very flavorful  it is a little too salty for my tastes but still delicious!
the service here has considerably declined over the years  it takes so long to get their attention for extra water  tea or just to get the check  i recently went there and there and they forgot to give us chopsticks  spoons or even cups for water  we only noticed after our food came and had to wave them down to ask for utensils  and i frequently notice that my cup is always dirty  i'm going to be avoiding this place from now on  no matter how good the food may be  it can't make up for their bad service and dirty cups 
the xiao long baos here are second to none  there's a reason it's been michelin recommended so many years running  the place is fairly standard inside as far as chinese cafes go  but the service is prompt and the price is fair xlb (soup dumps)   these guys have more or less nailed these  the flavor was ridiculously good  with the combo of the soup  meat and casing being perfect crispy noodles with pork  seafood and fish   again  they do crispy noodles right  i've been to so many places where they're either soggy  or near burnt  but this was the perfect blend  toppings were also great  with the shredded pork being mixed with cabbage  enoki mushrooms  shrimp  and white fish spicy beef pepper noodle soup   contrary to the wording  not actually that spicy  but the soup does a great job of taking on the flavor of the green peppers and shredded beef  the noodles are all house made  and have a great texture and bite to them definitely worth a trip 
it's a no frills restaurant and the only thing you order is the xiao long bao  okay enough humor it's a good place to get that and a bunch of other side dishes such as noodles and the scallion pancakes which is really good  the pricing is cheap too  just remind to bring cash
i feel very disappointed after hearing claims that nan xiang has the best xiao long bao in nyc  what? did yall get new chefs or something? the xiao long bao when i went were way too big with very thick skin  all touching each other in the bamboo steamer so that they broke apart easily when picked up  ugh  yeah  prices are really cheap  so maybe worth a visit if you're in the area  definitely not worth a trek to flushing  beef scallion pancake w  hoisin sauce was gud tho 
hands down great food & service  the soup dumplings( both pork & crab meat) are so delicious  i also recommend the chive bun which is very flavorable and healthy at the same time  not to mention  free  unlimited tea to drink! good  cozy environment  it gets packed after 2pm  but wait times are no more than 10 min  no need to spend fancy to enjoy a great  filling meal  for a chive bun  2 orders of soup dumplings (6 per entry)  and beef & scallion pancake  and bottomless tea all for under $25  is an amazingly cheap deal for 2 people! cheers to that!
this place is really spacious and i came here on a friend recommendation for their soup dumplings  heard it was one of the best so had to give it a try  needless to say they were half correct  i mainly enjoy joe's shanghai dumplings  but they were able to top joe's with their crab soup dumpling  it contained more flavor and was definitely delicious and on point  but don't simply take my word for it give it a try yourself
hands down the best spot in queens for soup dumpling and scallion pancake  it is so goood  i usually order two batches of soup dumpling (6pieces) and one order of scallion pancakes  and if i'm extra hungry  pan fried udon noodles  i tried the soy milk before but it was disgusting  not sure if it's because it's fresh and not sweet  which is what i'm used to  but it didn't hit the spot for me  the service is a hit or miss  they're usually so busy that they can't accommodate to everyone but still  that is no excuse  price is definitely a plus  everything is super cheap and affordable 
fyi  cash onlythis was my first soup dumpling experience (yay)! there was quite a wait  but we took it as a good sign  obviously we had  in order of best to "meh" + scallion pancake with sliced beefthe best thing we ate! zomg  beefy with a savory oysterish sauce!+ hand made steamed dumplingsmy second favorite  these had a thicker dough  but i really enjoyed the greens mixed in + steamed crab + pork bunsthe filling was rich  as was the soup broth  the meat combo was great + steamed pork bunsso good!   fried doughhuge and petty good  but a bit plain for my tastes  sui mai very meaty and juicy  but a bit bland  they also tasted a bit different than i'm used to   at first i thought they were undercooked  but they weren't our pre tip total was $32 service was bad at the beginning (10 minutes for anyone to come over)  but i guess that's typical of chinese places  overall it was a great first soup dumpling experience!
omgwhy did i come all the way to flushing to eat?a quick business trip as the wife had 2 days of training (in the coldest days of the year  of course)we stood in line in 20 degree temperatures       brrrrrrrrrin a nutshell 1  pan fried dumplings (lots of juice  almost soup dumpling like) and meaty2 soup pork dumplings   omg  (no more to add  just take my word for it)3  scallion pancakes   i'm not normally a fan  but theirs was light  flaky  crispy; not dull oily and flat like every other place   just trust me on this one again!cash only  and you have to park in a garage next door (unless you get dropped off  which i recommend   you'll be like jerry and elaine in the soup nazi episode   you'll have to sit down after eating the above!)
i've been delaying writing this review because i seriously cannot remember how the food or service was  came here after my boyfriend ran a race at flushing meadows  and i must have been so preoccupied with feeling proud of him for his time  that checking this place off my to visit list after years seemed like no big deal  i do remember that the turnip puff pastries were fantastic  but he couldn't eat them because they had pork  i also remember that they forgot my order of youtiao and soymilk  which were what i came here for  but i was too stuffed to even ask 
the pork dumplings were delicious  huge portion and worth your money  the soup and the meat taste very clean  and i really enjoyed eating these  if i had to compare it to joe's i'd say they are about the same  with this being a little lighter and cleaner  this is a place i'd consider bringing my grandma  because i think she would approve of these we also got the green onion pancakes  which looked and tasted a little over fried in too much oil  with some soysauce  the flavor came out and it was pretty good service  it took us 40 minutes to get our one plate of dumplings  i'm not sure if they forgot our order or something  because the table next to us  who were seated 10 minutes after us  received their 6 orders of dumplings before us  when we asked the waitress  she didn't even respond or say "let me check"  she just walked away  we asked another waiter and 5 minutes later someone came back to tell us that i'll be out in one minute  it wasn't especially busy  so i don't really understand what took so long in responding to our question  we were patient enough 
the things we ordered  soybean milk  fried dough  turnip puffs  beef wrapped in scallion pancake  and soup dumplings  all under $20 and the two of us were stuffed! a price to quantity ratio that would be close to impossible in the city  the quality of the food stacked up to these cheap prices as well  the soybean milk tasted authentic enough and fried dough was a little stale  but good enough to satiate a craving  i was most surprised by the turnip puffs   something i would not have ordered if my friend hadn't  flaky exterior and a flavorful turnipy filling  i was expecting the outside to overwhelm the inside with blandness but i was proven wrong! would definitely order these again  the beef wrapped in scallion pancake was solid  my only quip being that there would have been more meat  soup dumplings were some of the best i've ever had   thin delicate skin  delicious broth  and ample filling  one star deduction as some of the food was served on rather grimy looking plates and some of the staff were just sitting around on their phones constantly  but honestly that's pretty typical service at a chinese restaurant anyways  a definite must visit if you're in flushing!
so good! had the steamed pork buns  scallion pancake with sliced beef  shanghai pan fried u don  and the rice cake with beef everything was amazing and very affordable prices also! will definitely be coming back on my next visit to new york
just flew in to queens  ny from miami  i received a strong recommendation from a family member to eat here at "nan xiang xiao long bao"  i was told to try the steamed pork buns and the shanghai pan fried u don because they are "amazing" amazing they were  from the broth inside the pork bun to the texture of the u don  my pallet was truly enlightened  service was great and food was as speedy as these nyc streets  great place and i'll be back very soon!
i'm always looking for places that do xiao long bao (xlb) well  which brought me to nan xiang xiao long bao  i actually flew into la guardia to check this spot out with my tight travel schedule  it was only a few miles from the airport and close to a train station to get to manhattan  perfect!best xlb that i've tried so far  yes  i've tried all the other well known spots  nothing on the west coast comes close to the xlb here  the meat to skin ratio is awesome; plenty of meat with a thin skin  this means that you have to be careful when handling these delectable pieces of heaven because if you're not  you'll be spilling some precious soup broth  1 order comes with 6  so order accordingly  i had dinner plans  so i only ordered 1  which was a mistake  next time i'm ordering 2 3 for myself service was fast and efficient  but don't expect friendly social service you might get at other nyc restaurants  cash only
bumping up to 4 stars for the price  i ordered pork xiao long bao  pork buns  dumplings  shanghai udon noodles  and beef scallion pancake all for only $35  incredible !otherwise this would have been a solid 3 5  everything was tasty  but did not wow me for the amount of reviews and kudos this place has  soup dumplings were also just par  not amazed  joe's shanghai still has the best according to my taste buds  also the restaurant could have been a bit cleaner  not sure if it's because i went on a friday night around 9 30 pm  but there was discarded plates and food just hanging around on a cart by the bathroom  bathroom was also very wet everywhere and not hygienic 
a flushing staple!!! at this point i've tried over half the menu and haven't had a single thing that wasn't excellent  the scallion pancakes are flakey and chewy at the same time  and the stuffed scallion pancakes are even better  pan fried noodles are so damn good i could literally eat a whole plate of the them by myself  of course the soup dumplings are the real star here  flavorful and delicious  i came here twice this week so you could say i'm a fan  also conveniently located across the street from a parking lot so parking wasn't an issue for us 
very solid  but not best in class for me  last time we were here  we got soup dumplings  scallion pancakes (one order with beef  one without)  fried pork dumplings  pan fried udon noodles  and shao mai  all very good  but i wasn't blown away by anything  and it's a decent amount more expensive than shanghai cafe  which remains my standard bearer for both quality and price 
amazing xiao long bao! definitely one of the best ive had  the rice cake with shredded pork was also so good with the perfect balance of sweet and savory  the beef with tripe was pretty solid as well it seemed like most of our food was cold though  ( we got the soymilk and it was super watery and the shanghai udon stirred noodle was pretty tough bc it wasnt cooked fresh  our waiter gave us quite the attitude too  so i give it 4 stars overall!
i came here because of all the great reviews!! soup dumpling is pretty good  but what i'm most impressed is the cold dishes  cucumbers and tofu as pictures attached  it's refreshing and tasty!i tried the spiced oil wonton and beef green onion cake  they were a little different taste than what i am used to  i don't recommend them  chives cake is great!overall  the food and price is great  service is slow but bearable 
just adding my 5 star review to this restaurant's giant collection of similarly glowing  happy ones  the serving sizes are great and the food is delicious  i've loved nan xiang since my parents brought me here years ago  so much that i asked for my 17th birthday dinner with my family to be here on top of the crab and pork soup dumplings  try the seafood pan fried udon noodles 
our go to for soup dumplings! food is consistently good  only negative is that the soup dumplings can take a minute since they are made to order  it's always busy but the food is worth the wait 
only get the soup dumplings  nothing else here is worth a try  the service is fast but weird  there is a women sitting at the reception that acts like a madam  she doesnt help with anything   just seems to count cash  the soup dumplings were good  the crab ones were the best  i dont want to talk about the other things because they were quite disappointing
you can't ignore the signs  when something is michelin rated as many times as this place  you'd be silly not to drop in whilst visiting flushing  this was our last stop on dump tour 2017 and i was feeling full  but that did not stop me    i went for the spicy pepper and beef soup noodle and the pork soup dumplings  they bigger than your average dumpling  and the all the flavors that come out of that sweet sweet bun are a winning combination  in my opinion these buns are up there with the best  top 3 easily!!!the spicy pepper and beef noodle soup was also pretty delicious  could have done with some more vegetable as it was literally pepper and beef but beside that  an enjoyable dish  this spot is deffo worth the wait if there is a queue  if you're a fan of soup dumplings you will not be disappointed!
the soup buns are more light than joe's  shanghai down the street  these are the 2 main competitors  i'm  shanghainese and must say that these  soup buns are fantastic  the restaurant  always has a wait  there's  outlets around for a quick phone charge though  i usually get the spicy  appetizers   numbs my tongue  their pan fried noodles aren't  worth the money  neither are their rice cakes  this is usually  the restaurant i go to right when i arrive home from college breaks with my suitcase and all  not a soup bun you can just make at home  i recommend the regular pork soup bun ($6 50) which comes with  6 pieces per basket  i see a lot of non asians when i come here  it is evidently the spot to go to  the bathroom is decent here  4 stars because the staff should  be more attentive and shouldn't  stick people at a table in the doorway in the winter  and the bathroom  needs some cleaning  they make their soup buns well  that's  what  matters!
it's always when i have expectations that i seem to get disappointed  even with great reviews  i need to walk in like yelp doesn't exist & that i know nothing of an establishment  service   below average  i love the city and everything it has to offer  but what its lacking is some awesome service  the server didn't check on us once  they took our order and dropped off our food   everything else we had to go hunt him down food   about average  there were 5 of us and we ordered a bunch of different things for the table   scallion pancake with slice beef (3   5)  shanghai pan fried u don (3 5)  steamed crab meat & pork buns (4   5)  pan fried dumplings (2 5   5)  spicy ramen (2 5   5)  everything was just pretty bland   nothing stood out too much  if i ever went back  the steamed buns were soupy but had a good amount of meat  so they were decent  there are so much better places around though!!!
over 2000 reviews must be good  and indeed it was   sf bay area just recently opened din tai fung which is totally legit  i only been to the one in seattle and they call it juicy dumplings  they juicy   at nan xiang  they are a little wider and slightly thicker on the skin   the broth and pork filling was absolutely devine   probably best meal of the week in nyc   had both pork and one with crab pork   green onion pancake  simple but chewy oily good flavor   hot soy milk  legit   handmade dumplings clean   stir fried rice cakes perfect as well came on a thursday at noon  no wait but place was full in minutes with people waiting   this area of flushing is the real deal chinatown of america  everything is good here 
delicious xiaolongbao! so juicy and flavorful  we got both the regular anb ones  the other dishes were okay  we got spicy beef  stir fired noodles  cucumber and a dried tofu dish  everything was so cheap  for three of us it was a little over $30 
i found this spot as i was looking for a new place around flushing that had soup dumplings  this place had over 2 000 reviews so i figured it would be the best  i was wrong  i don't know what all the hype was about but i didn't enjoy any of the food   at all  i tried the scallion pancakes  pan fried udon noodles and the soup dumplings  the scallion pancakes tasted like dough and not in a good way  i usually like them thinner and crispy but this one was plain and thick  not a fan  the pan fried noodles were ok    just very bland  they look a lot better than they taste  now  the soup dumplings were good if you aren't bothered by fishy scents and if you like yours with more crab pork and less soup  however  the smell of the crab was so fishy and overwhelming that it was making me a little sick  there was barely any soup in it either and it was really disappointing  won't be coming back here again    i'll stick to my favorite spot at joes shanghai a few blocks away 
they open early and the food is fresh and hot   nothing else to say but damn good food ok ok  someone asked for more details  this is a hole in the wall  they've done well enough that at some point they've expanded  waitresses are moody at times  the prices are very reasonable  you can easily get an assortment for $20 and be full  i work the over night shift and want dinner at 8am  plates cups can be greasy so keep an eye out  i haven't been here during peak hours so i don't know about the wait time 
we arrived hungry on a saturday afternoon and we left an hour later completely satisfied  started the meal with a delicious and savory plate of cucumber spears topped with slivers of fresh garlic in a sesame garlic sauce that had me slurping from the bottom of the dish  followed by a bowl of pork and veg wontons in spicy sesame sauce  multiple orders of the best crab and pork soup dumplings i've ever had  the broth was rich and unctuous  the wrappers thin but not fragile  and the after bite  a wee tender ball of pork and papery wrapper  was like that extra long hug you didn't know you needed but are so glad to be receiving  for a little variety  also had bright and springy steamed vegetable dumpling that  when topped with the slightly smoky chili paste  were a whole other and equally delightful experience  i wished my stomach to be larger  it didn't happen  i had to leave  but i will be back 
hmmm i got to say their soup dumplings and chive pancake was great! you can skip the beef scallion pancake and pork bun  it was just so so   
i was intrigued by this place because its one of the most popular spots in flushing and serves food from my hometown  shanghai  i had high hopes for this place because of all the good reviews  and to say the least  i wasn't let down  i also wasn't amazed because nothing here was extraordinary  i ordered the beef tripe  wine chicken  and soup dumplings  the beef tripe and wine chicken were a little too cold for my taste and the wine chicken was a little too wine y  however  the soup dumplings was better here than the joe's shanghai  and it's a lot cheaper  the vibe here was really chill as everyone was just trying to get meal in   i recommend coming here if you're craving a quick meal  but for better shanghai foods  i very much recommend going to kung fu xiao long bao 
the quality of food has gone down   we ordered take out on a monday night  first of all  the lady who picks up the phone barely knows english   had no idea what i was saying   1  food is super duper oily after i specifically told them less oil2  poor food presentation skills !!! see attached pic3  ordered beef scallion package  scallion pancake was drenched in oil that was still raw and there one a thin layer of beef  gross4  gave us broken crab soup dumplings and broken shanghainese crab soup dumplings 5  i called them back to let them know that the dough of the scallion pancake was still raw and the lady who picked up the phone literally said " well i don't work in the kitchen what can i do  there was no apology  i will never come here again  way too many better restaurants in flushing
came here a while ago  but till this day my family will probably never go to this restaurant again the reason was the waitress that was helping us  she took forever to come take out order  too forever to get our check and took forever to give us change back  it was a saturday and honestly it wasn't that busy  so we had no idea why it was taking her so long to get everything done i am a very patient person and so is my sister  but it really took too long and got both of us irritated  on top of that the tone of her voice was not pleasant at all and got us even more irritated with her i will say the food is good  but if service here is bad  i wouldn't go again no matter how good the food is this happened almost a year ago  so you can see how customer service makes a difference 
ain't nan thing wrong with the place  my family and i managed to finagle our way to a table at this place for an early saturday dinner and we were not disappointed  we got a bunch of dumplings  salted soy milk (kind of like a soy milk congee)  rice cakes  and numerous other carbs  the menu contains an extensive list of unique and highly tasty sounding dishes i'm now a big fan of the veggie dumplings  unlike a lot of other veggie dumplings there's none of that cellophane noodle  it's actually made of greens (i couldn't decipher what) and paired with dipping sauces makes for a pleasant vegetarian experience while the rest of my family were thoroughly enjoying the classic xiao long bao (soup dumplings)  i recommend trying salted soy milk for a unique experience and to see if you enjoy it  it's very soy sauce heavy  but i personally enjoy that  there's also a number of greens on the menu that i don't often see available at other restaurants and am tempted to return just for the veg 
what is a trip to flushing without dim sum?  this place did not disappoint   we ordered the scallion pancakes  soup dumplings with crab  shu mai and noodles   all were delicious   service was surprisingly good   definitely worth the trip!
are you somewhat new to new york and think you've found "authentic" chinese cuisine in new york's chinatown? maybe you've discovered the soup dumplings at joe's shanghai  well  whether the prior is true or not  you haven't tried delicious soup dumplings until you've tried them at nan xiang  if you've never taken a trip out to flushing  you're in for a nice surprise  this is new york's true "chinatown " and with no shortage of great dumpling spots  nan xiang is your only true spot for soup dumplings  nan xiang is budget friendly (read  cheap)  michelin rated (yep  it's true!) and while small and it may appears to have quite a wait for a table  they essentially have three split dining rooms  so  plenty of tables and we didn't have to wait for one more than a few minutes at most  in addition to the soup dumplings  the scallion pancakes were also worth trying  just a quick hop from manhattan on the 7 train and you'll be there in no time! definitely worth a visit!
tourist trap  not as good as people claim  seriously  customer service sucks  this is what i order steam bun  it's ok  i had betterfried pork chop  too oilybeef noodle soup  not much meat  too much bell pepper in soup  not much flavor or noodles  try a different place  tons of other places in flushing for steam buns  people only come cuz it got overrated online 
nanxiang  xlb haikufamous soup dumplingcarb fat meat soup all in one can eat this all day
delicious food and amazing customer service! always a lovely experience  the soup dumplings are a must 
pork soup dumplings   beef scallion pancake  black fungus   these are the definite must  have items on the menu! this place is kinda a free for all  but in the best "i'm in flushing" kinda way! cash only  delicious  hot  perfect  go!
been wanting to try this place forever but was not tryna deal with weekend brunch crowds  i made the trek out here at around 2pm on a sunday and was quoted 20 minutes but they seated our party of 2 within 5 minutes  this place is pretty big but the hype is real so it will probably be packed at all times kao fu   solid portions and tasty! great starter as you wait for your freshly steamed dumplings sheng jian bao   i personally prefer sjbs to xlbs but the ones at nxxlb were disappointing  they lacked the soup that makes sjbs so amazing  would skip these and just order another basket of xlbs  crab & pork xlb   star of the show hands down  this was easily the best crab xlb i've had in nyc  they were plump and bursting with crab flavor our food + 1 soymilk came out to under $30 including tax and tip  would i wait an hour for this place? probably not  but it's definitely worth making a trip to flushing if you're trying to eat during an off hour [cash only]
we often come here to this little casual restaurant to get delicious chinese street food   the price is very reasonable and there is plenty of seating even though it's quite popular with the locals   i'd definitely recommend the crab and pork xiao long bao and you really can't go wrong with most of the rest of the menu either 
hands down the best dim sum place ever! the pork steam buns and crab steam buns were awesome  the dumplings were good too  def worth the hype  customer service was amazing  went in on a friday night and expected to wait 20 mins but we got seated within 5 mins  10 10 food10 10 customer service
soup dumplings are delicious!! the meat is juicy and flavorful  the dough isn't too thick and doesn't break  the soup is hot (be careful) and not too oily or salty  we have also gotten udon there  but go to are definitely the soup dumplings  prices are reasonable  there is almost always a wait on weekends but it moves relatively quickly as there is a lot of seating 
i was thoroughly disappointed by the soup dumplings here  after seeing all the great reviews and how famous this place is for their soup dumplings  i expected so much more  i've had way better soup dumplings in many lesser known places  the two dishes that i really enjoyed were the beef scallion pancakes and the jellyfish  we also got an order of turnip pastries and bean pastries  these were okay; better than the soup dumplings  i guess you could come here to try these "famous" soup dumplings for yourself  but they're not as good as you may think 
come for the soup dumplings  but skip everything else  i loved the pork soup dumplings  but everything else we tried was pretty bad  the udon noodles were a skip (super greasy and not too tasty) as well as the seafood noodle ish soup  all not so good  but the soup dumplings = superb; they would earn 5 stars  4 stars because everything else we tried was lackluster place is cash only  the broth and pork inside the dumplings is so comforting  a bowl of warmth in your heart in a dreary world that's no longer dreary because you're eating these dumplings  so  so  good  service is alright  the tea they serve with your order is great  the prices are great  but once again    if you want my take  order the soup dumplings   maybe some other dumplings to share  but i'd skip on any of the other meals 
some people might say that din tai fung is the gold standard for xiaolong bao shanghainese dumplings  that might be true for the original location in taiwan  but i can say for certain that nan xiang xiao long bao beats them at their own game at all other locations  and any other restaurant i've been to it's located along an unassuming strip of restaurants on a relatively quiet street in flushing  we were seated right away (it was monday)  and subsequently started ordering food right away seafood crispy noodle   great  but thought that the noodles should have been a bit more crispy scallion noodle   deep flavors  especially with the charred scallion  when i think of "wok hei" and the flavor it imparts  i can't help but think of these noodles pork + vegetable wontons in spicy sauce + peanut sauce   delicious  if you're not a fan of spicy food  don't worry  this is fine  it involves more of a numbing oil that gives it a little bit of heat as opposed to a deep  sweat inducing spice  i recommend that you save the leftover sauce  because it will make the xiaolong bao taste that much better pork xiaolong bao   to this date  the best i've ever had  i've had xiaolong bao at countless dim sum joints  multiple din tai fung locations and everything in between  nothing tops the ones served here  one thing i noticed is that these are larger in size and feature a lot more soup  the  meat and flavors inside the dumpling are unreal  and are complemented well by both the vinegar and the spicy sauce from the dish above  if you want a perfect bite of food  it really doesn't get better than this my only gripe about the restaurant is the time it takes for food to come out  perhaps i came on a day that wasn't as busy as it usually is (even though it seemed full)  so they weren't constantly steaming dumplings  but if i were in flushing chinatown for any reason  i'd find each and every excuse imaginable to come eat here 
while everyone here goes for the soup dumplings  (which are definitely melt in your mouth incredible)  my favorite dishes are the scallion pancakes (be sure to ask for it with the brown sauce) and the crispy  pan fried noodles with vegetables  the food is heavy and you might need a nap after  plan to go straight to bed when you leave here 
cheap and classic  their pork chop noodle is a classic shanghainese style  worth the try 
one of the best taiwanese restaurants i've been to  i came at 9am on a friday so it was pretty empty  we were seated right away  i ordered the udon noodles (very well cooked and flavorful)  warm soybean milk with fried dough to sip in  pork soup dumplings  and scallion pancakes with beef  the scallion pancakes were the highlight of my meal  they were crispy  flavorful and stuffed with meat  if you're in the area  stop by!
good quality soy milk and soup dumplings  and also very good price  there might a short wait if you come at proper dinner time at weekends
the food  it's pretty good  especially for the price  this is my third trip to this place  and it still hasn't lost its luster whether you're ordering an appetizer of jelly fish  or getting the sweetest and flakiest scallion pancakes  this place never fails to satisfy your taste buds the food was delivered in a timely manner  but after the plates are served  the staff summarily ignore you  lol  nobody at my table had a refill of tea  it would have been great to be 'checked in' on at least twice throughout the eating ritual regardless  it's still an overall awesome experience 
cash only  pork and shrimp xlb all the way! here's how it works  sit down  order xlb  eat xlb  drink tea  pay  leave 
for the price you are paying  this is a great affordable soup dumpling place  pretty big place  plain with no decorations just white walls  quick and friendly service  good food only suggestion is to keep utensils dried and more clean and bathrooms can improve (cleaner floor  better soap holder  hand dryer needs an upgrade) you get what you pay for  in the end this is a $ place  what more do you expect?
i thought the xlbs were okay   i'm not sure why everyone is raving about it  they were large but the broth was a bit bland quality 3 5price 4 5
xiao lon bao used to be my favorite dish to bring my family to enjoy it flushing is so many food restaurant nowadays，but xiao long bao still is good to try  try nan xiang，let us know what is？
i came here on a saturday evening (a little after 5pm) and we were seated pretty quickly  especially for a large party of 10  (note  we did call ahead ) it was definitely busier when we left   people were waiting outside to be seated we ordered a few of their dim sum dishes  which also came out quickly  we had to ask for tea and refills later scallion pancakes   they're okay  but they pale in comparison to the beef scallion pancakes  which are basically a beef version of peking duck (see below) scallion pancakes with sliced beef   get this  the scallion pancake was crispier and filled with beef  hoisin sauce  and green onions  if i came here and only ordered this  i would be happy  best dish of the night!pan fried dumplings   nothing special  not very "pan fried " when i eat pan fried dumplings  i want to be able to see that they were pan fried (the browner  the better!)  these were so pale white that they could be passed for steamed or boiled  they also ate like soupy dumplings  except that instead of being filled with soup  it was filled with grease steamed vegetable dumplings   kind of bland  needs soy sauce soupy dumplings   we got both the pork and crab pork buns  they were a good size and loaded with soup  good flavor  but i wasn't a big fan of the skin   it was too sticky chewy for my tastes  overall  the dumplings came off of the platter without a big mess  but some of the baskets were leaking broth before we even dug into them the meal was satisfying and we all felt full afterward  it's a great value for large groups  which is why i give them four stars 
my best friend loves coming here for soup dumplings and won't stop coming here  i personally believe the soup dumpling skin is really thick here compared to kung fu xiao long bao  nonetheless  the food is really good here we ordered crab and pork soup dumplings (4 5)a little too drypork soup dumplings (5 5)always a go to choicerice cake with beef (5 5)good portions with mushroom and lettucescallion pancake (5 5) must get  the bread is cooked too fluffiness
yum! came here starving after a long drive from boston  normally our go to place is kung fu xlb  however they had just closed when we arrived  nan xiang is open late (till 1am) and had good reviews  so we went  ended up getting the two types of xlb  1 pork and 1 crab pork  the dumplings were so incredibly juicy and full of soup  more soupy than most places i've been to  the meat was good as well  the only criticism i would say is that the skin could've been a little thinner  although they probably make it a bit thicker in case it punctures and all that flavorful soup comes running out (worst thing that could happen)  we also got the shanghai pan fried udon noodles  which were pretty damn basic  since it really only had 3 ingredients (noodles  pork  and a couple slices of bok choy) +soy sauce  if you're familiar with chinese cuisine  the taste is exactly the same as "gong chau know hoh" which is the flat noodles with beef commonly served at dim sum  i really enjoy just eating noodles without a lot of ads ins though so it was good enough for me 
if you like really well made dumplings this is just the place  the place are kind and the dumplings are stupid tasty dont go here expecting to get dumplings and maybe some noodle and a side of sautéed veggies or whatnot   this is just dumplings and did i mention they are wicked good??
i have been coming here for quite some time now and i have go to say  the food is sooo good   the soup dumplings  the beef scallion pancakes  the noodles  fried dumplings  i've had it all! the thing i will never understand is why the service is soo bad   if they were to work on their service i would give them 5 stars   tip  they only take cash*oh! i forgot to add that i couldn't order a drink because they had no clean cups  absolutely unheard of!
when in flushing  we frequent this joint for their famous soup dumplings and warm soy milk accompanied with fried dough  sometimes all i need is a simple and tasty meal  the service is not the fastest but doable given they serve the food  fairly quick  during my recent visit  the fried dough (yau tail) tasted like it has been sitting around for a while  it wasn't as crispy and fresh as my previous visit  i minus one star for stale fried dough  overall  i will return for the soup dumplings and soy milk 
the fried dumplings are to die for  the best i have ever ate  the fresh made to order noodle soup is ok  but you have to go and try there dumplings 
the scallion pancakes are authentically great   well  the real chinese ones might be a tad more oily  but i can understand why that wouldn't work for locals  the soup dumplings were excellent too   warning  grab them by the top with the pincers  else you risk breaking them and losing the sauce  soup    and be watchful  they come super hot  so you'll need to time your approach carefully  too early and you might burn your mouth  too late and you'll lose the hotness of it  plus the interior can be much hotter than the exterior  enjoy the delectable challenge !
maybe best soup dumplings in flushing  sorry joe shanghai  okay and a must is the cucumber garlic appetizer and this thick noodle platter  i haven't eaten anything that wasn't good her  prices are fair  order the fried dough for dessert i promise you won't regret it  this place is always packed and for good reason 
came here before it used to be super good quality has gone down recently  the meat is not smelling great  service is rude
nan xiang is known for having some of the best soup dumplings in nyc  and they really deliver on this! i've been here several times already  and the xlb are a hit every time  on my most recent visit  i came for breakfast (they are one of the few places in flushing that open super early) and was seated right away  there are plenty of pre prepared side dishes ("little eats") that you can order  and i opted to start with the tofu edamame mixture  which was dressed so nicely with a slightly tart vinegar and was ever so slightly spicy from a few pieces of chili  delicious!! we also ordered the savory "tofu brains " a mixture of silken tofu and a light broth  the broth was not too salty and was ever so slightly fishy from the little shrimps that were included  but overall not my favorite dish  and then of course  the star of the show  the soup dumplings! we opted for the crab pork dumplings  and the filling was absolutely delicious and seasoned perfectly  the crab imparted the perfect amount of sweetness to the pork  my only complaint was that some of the dumpling skins didn't hold up very well and sprung a leak  but in terms of flavor  they were all on point! also  the prices here are more than reasonable  and you'll get great value for your money 
the food here is well priced  and consistently tasty  it's good for a quick bite on your own and for larger groups  i enjoy their "breakfast menu" and soup dumplings the best 
food is 5 star  they deserve it  and the service is 0 star  service is very bad  and it is cash only 
nan xiang xlb is a solid all around shanghainese restaurant  but i'm not sure it lives up to the hype  the soup dumplings here are good  but i've certainly had better elsewhere   i came here with my family and ordered the crab and pork soup dumplings  the scallion pancake with beef  crisp red bean pastries  crisp turnip pastries  and jellyfish with turnip   the beef scallion pancakes and red bean pastries were the standout items in my opinion   the scallion pancake was crisp without being too oily  and the hoisin sauce complimented the beef really well   the red bean pastries are something that is hard to find  even in chinatown   the soup dumplings didn't impress me  though   they tasted like your standard xlb  and the broth was a little too oily for my liking   i also couldn't taste the crab flavor   overall  nan xiang is a good place to start if you've never tried xiao long bao  but i wouldn't feel compelled to seek out this place in particular   they have plenty of other delicious items on the menu  though  so if you do happen to come here  give the other dishes a try 
this is a staple in flushing china town  i come here often for the rice noodles  pork and mustard greens  i also love the scallion pancakes 
food is good as usual but service is different story  took me multiple time to ask for ginger for the dumplings where they should automatically serve alone  then took me few times to ask for a check  store was only half full at the time 
after trying so many soup dumpling places in new york city  this spot has to be one of the best! i would be coming here more often if it wasn't so far from me  the soup dumplings are juicy and flavorful   you can even see the workers freshly wrapping the dumplings and steaming it  i would also recommend ordering the scallion pancake or scallion pancake wrapped with beef  the stir fry noodles were also pretty good but was a bit too oily and didn't have enough vegetables  overall  you can't go wrong with coming here for delicious soup dumplings for a reasonable price  just make sure you remember to bring cash since they are a cash only establishment 
in general  the food served is so so  not as delicious as so many reviews have indicated  the service  however  is terrible  during the entire time i was sitting there  no one refilled my tea even though i asked twice  also  a lot of things on the menu cannot be served  ex beef noodle  the waiter took order of so many tables that the food was not served based on who came in first   i really cannot imagine how such a terrible place could get a 4 star on yelp   
check it out if you are looking for authentic soup dumplings(xiao long balls)with reasonable price!i spend about $11 with soup dumplings on a set of 6 soup dumplings with crab and salty soy milk  i got sooo full! the wrap of the soup dumplings is not too soft  so you don't need to worry about breaking it  the soup inside has the taste of crab! stuffing is big and yummy!however  if you really care about the environment and the level of clearness  it may not be the right place for you  maybe you can do takeout  my table is absolutely not clean  so i had to wipe it again by myself food is fast  and staffs remember what you told them no matter how busy they are 
came here on a sunday afternoon around 3 30 expecting a long wait  but was seated within 10 minutes (2 people)  i wish we came with more people because there were so many things on the menu we wanted to try!we ended up with the crab and pork soup dumplings (of course)  shen jian bao  chili and pork noodles  shumai  and scallion pancakes soup dumplings were amazing   crab taste was very apparent  which i liked but my boyfriend not so much  skin was perfectly chewy and didn't fall apart super easily  shen jian bao were also really good  there was also soup inside  and the meat filling was very flavorful  my favorite part was the crispy bottom of the bun scallion pancakes were just okay   too fried and oily for my taste shu mai was great  loved the generous filling of glutinous rice chili and beef noodles were nothing special  wasn't even spicy unfortunately  and the meat had a strange texture overall this place was very good and worth a trip app the way out to flushing  their famous soup dumplings did not disappoint  though some of their other menu items fell a bit short  also they are cash only so come prepared!
came here on the weekend  i think some time in between breakfast lunch and dinner  i only had like $5 worth of cash (this place doesn't take card)  so my options for ordering were limited to basically fried dough and soy milk  they were pretty cheap for a sit down restaurant  so that was decent  the fried dough was also very good  probably the best i've had in nyc thus far  however  since i ordered it at like around 11 am  i wasn't surprised to find that it was a little cold  i guess this place  like many places which serve fried dough  only do it once a day  and then leave them out to sit for the rest of the day may be back  but honestly going to real restaurants which don't accept card is a real pain cash only
i was craving xiao long bao but had to get the veggie dumplings instead of beef or crab because everything else contains pork or is pork based  i think the dumplings contained cabbage and some other veggies i didn't like  it was bland and i hate cabbage too rant   i couldn't find only beef dumplings anywhere in flushing which is deeply saddening  after looking through the entire food court for beef dumplings  an employee finally told me that chinese people don't like beef  she failed to explain why as she's not fluent in english  which is not her fault  she was nice though other rant  i fail to understand why asians and some arabs use cabbage as a substitute in salad or any other dish? cabbage cannot & will never be lettuce  yes  i'm a lettuce lover  especially iceberg lettuce  i hate cabbage unless its kimchi or cooked desi style 
great go to spot  solid  affordable comfort foods with quick service  bring cash!
proper soup dumplings on a good block of flushing to go food hopping  i would recommend getting a couple of steamed ones and definitely give the fried ones a go  the fried ones will take a pretty long time  and the wait to sit is usually quite long which is the downside of the spot  also  pretty important to note that this is a cash only spot 
my favorite spot for soup dumplings! too bad it isn't in the city or i'd be here very often  the pork soup dumplings are my favorite here   piping hot soup in a thin wrap with pork  the pancakes and the udon are my next go to orders  i also tried the shanghainese shu mai; almost a sticky rice dumpling  nice to try but don't think i'll order again 
got the pancake and not really a fan  as someone who has the original before  this is a little too salty at various spots in the bite (seems like the salt weren't mix in well during the process) and it was too doughy in the middle (taste like the dough was under cooked while the outside is crunchily good)  got the pork chop noodle  which i'm also not a fan of  the pork chop came separate and it's super oily  the only thing that came out well is the seafood noodle  which also went a little on the salty side 
soy milk was good (it's sweetened) xiao long bao was good  came out fresh and hot (they won't taste good if they have been sitting for a while) sheng jian bao had too much bread compared to the amount of meat inside (e g   meat to bread ratio too low) overall pretty authentic but it's weird they also mention they have northern dishes right under the store sign which makes me question the authenticity 
best soup dumplings! delicious food  beef and string beans  noodles everything is delicious  service was fast and friendly  if possible i would like to visit again 
really good scallion pancake  nice crisp  good thickness and moist inside  pea shoots were tasty maybe a bit oily and salty but good  nice xiaolong bao skin  the cloth on the bottom of the steamer is fabric and makes the transfer much smoother  good salty bean curd and milk 
really fair pricing for better chinese food than chinatown!loved the beef scallion pancakes and shao mai  the skin of the shao mai was really thin just how i like it and the sticky rice tasted really good  unfortunately didn't have a chance to eat the xiaolongbao because my friend doesn't eat pork  but i'll definitely be back!the seafood crispy noodles were a disappointment though  they were very bland in flavor  the fish and noodles were good  just lacked flavor 
wonderful service   the staff was very friendly  i recommend everyone to stop by for a quick bite
nan xiangny queens flushing12pm friday 23rd september 2016four starsit was good but not that good  tiffany tried to convince me that they had a michelin star but i am pretty sure their b food safety rating would automatically eliminate them from contention  they are however michelin recommended which holds some but not very much significance  we were seated immediately  the warm soy milk was too asian for me  the sticky rice with chinese minced beef jerky was good  the beef noodle soup had some amazing noodles  they were thick  chewy  and fresh  the small strips of beef were dry and mediocre   i want these noodles with xi'an foods spicy tingly beef   today's the soup dumplings were good   the wrappers were a bit fat and soggy but they were pretty thin   the junction at the top was very thick and chewy   the meat had a nice combination of fatty and lean meat  the soup was warm and delicious  the service was decent 
authentic and delicious at the right price with extra props to their crab and pork soup dumplings and spicy beef noodle soup  convenient metered parking lot across the street 
good eats! very popular spot for soup dumplings  noodle soup  scallion pancakes and other delicious dishes  staff is friendly and quick to get food on the table 
not incredibly sure if it's worth the hype  but you definitely cannot go wrong with a visit here  i really only came from the rave reviews and the nice michelin man welcoming me in on the window  but i wasn't disappointed  my pork dumplings were fresh and tasty  and maybe not the best i've ever had  but very good nonetheless  they were pretty busy so i was happy to have gotten a table on a friday night  service was no frills  quick  and dependable  a really good choice for some asian food 
favorite and best for soup dumplings  can't go wrong here  i've been at least a dozen times  sometimes they forget my order  take too long to take my order or give us a receipt  i get they are always busy  i still go for the great food 
i been wanting to come here and never did because of the long lines  so my boyfriend and i were meeting friends around the area  before that  we wanted to grab something before meeting them  when we went in  the lines were okay   not to bad  so we got our number and was told that it will be 10 mins wait  that's not bad at all  so we waited and waited for about 20 mins and we were still not seated  so they called number by number order  and suddenly skipped our number  we were like wth and asked them what about us   they told us because there was only two of us so we have to wait for a little bit  wth  i do not understand the long lines  they were few tables that were empty and don't understand why can't we be seated  anyway  not to long after we got our seat after 30 mins of wait and we were told 10 mins  so whatever  i'm just excited to try the xiao long bao and other stuff  the service is so terrible  the server was so rude  i asked for hot tea and he said i have to order first  wth lol  i cant read chinese character and  on the menu it didn't said unsweetened soy milk so i  asked the server if there's any unsweetened soy milk   i don't know if the server tried to be smart ass or what not and he told me to look at the menu  wth lol  whatever i'm hungry  so we ordered  crab and pork xiao long bao  beef pancakes  some handmade dumpling and rice shumai  to be honest  this place is so overatted  the food is okay and not that great but it's cheap tho  i saw a lot of good reviews and i was expecting more but i am not wow  maybe when the chinese restautants gets popular the quality sucks more  will i come back again? no  thank you  i rather go to the food court instead  the place is overcrowded and felt cramped when we waited inside  so uncomfortable 
came here for a snack and ended up devouring a full meal   i don't regret it the least bit  ordered the scallion pancakes  pan fried noodles  fried dough  and way too many soup dumplings  everything was hot and delicious  both service and prices are classic chinatown  lackluster but cheap  i typically just go to manhattan's chinatown to get my chinese food fix  but this place is worth trekking to flushing for  it's a cheaper version of joe's shanghai  essentially!
i've been here several times  from brooklyn  and it is worth the long drive  during peak hours there is a line so be prepared to wait  i really like their varied menu and their soy milk i've been told that it's actually made on the premises  my favorite items are the soup dumplings  scallion pancakes with beef  all the buns and shao mai  you can't go wrong coming here 
my hubby and i live in brooklyn  and the subway ride to flushing  queens is a schlep  one we happily make for nan xiang xiao long bao  we recently met a couple of friends there and the four of us shared steamed pork buns  steamed crab meat & pork buns  handmade dumplings  seafood crispy noodle  and scallion pancake with sliced beef  everything was freshly made  absolutely delicious  and the prices couldn't be more affordable  my only less than happy constructive criticism would be for the restaurant to do a better job of keeping the bathrooms clean  they were  hands down  the filthiest restaurant bathrooms i've ever seen 
we saw all the great reviews and just had to try it  and were greatly disappointed  there were some great dishes  but overall the food was bad enough that we will not be returning  both the sweet and salty soy milk were okay  stay away from the fried bun with chives & egg  scallion pancake w  sliced beef  and chicken with wine sauce (was not even cooked all the way!)  some of our party liked the vegetable dim sum  but majority of us found it a great disappointment  we absolutely loved the scallion pancake  jellyfish with radish  and crispy noodle with beef  the service was great  but the staff do not speak great english 
the positive i enjoyed the crab and pork soup dumplings they were well made  and you could watch them being made to order by a couple female chefs in a room near the dining room  the scallion and beef pancake was yummy but the sauce inside was a bit on the thick side for me  i was not a fan of the shao mai at all  the service here was absolutely terrible and the waiter were beyond rude and dismissive  we sat promptly and it took us over 10 minutes to finally get someone to come back and help us  mostly because the hostess saw us looking around for help and yelled from the hostess stand if we wanted to order  the place was empty which made no sense as to why it took so long  the dumpling were good  i don't know if i'd say they were the best in new york  but the service definitely doesn't have me wanting to come back 
always packed here but i must say i love their soup dumplings and im very picky about my pan fried dumplings but here its great!
the food is a solid 3 5  the zombie quality service and cleanliness last time i was in drops it down to 2 for a long time this was my classic spot for xiao long bao  my last visit though  the quality of both the pork and pork crab soup dumplings were just ok  the wrapper should be thin and with ideally 18 folds  these xlb were thicker and doughier and made for a chewy rather than silken texture  the soup and fillings inside were above average  michelin and other guides point this restaurant out for soup dumplings  and i would agree that this place is still currently one of the best places in nyc for them given the soup quality and the low price  i pretty much liked most other items on the menu better than the xlb here tho  the food is very inexpensive and this place stays open later than most during the week  so i'll probably return and just skip the xlb next time i'm in the area other notes   grab a ticket number inside and head back outside to wait  buy a drink  the water is comparable to pond water  brace yourself for shit table service  cash only 
best soup dumplings in the city  don't tell anyone cause lines get long   hot soy milk is great and plate of pure gluten is even better 
the soup dumplings may be almost the best in flushing but finding parking around here and service makes it difficult to fully enjoy the food there  the main draw here are no doubt the soup dumplings  they will usually only have that and a few other smaller dishes   at least morning and the day  if you want a sit down classic chinese sharing meal with plates of food  then look elsewhere  if you crave soup dumplings and other small dishes  this is the place  the only gripe i have with this place is the service  the lady in front isn't the nicest person and sometimes really grouchy but don't let her get to you  that's just how some people are  once you are seated down  it's all up hill from there  note  there are 2 types of soup dumplings  1  classic pork  2  shredded crab meat  and one order contains around 6 dumplings  your first time? grab an order of both   unless your allergic  then get the other one  enjoy!
i practically come here every time i go to flushing now(5ish times in the past 6 months)      items you must order  scallion pancake w  sliced beef & wontons in spicy peanut sauce(not wontons in soup)   havent had that can't get enough x3
we love their juicy bun and their hot soy bean milk  but  find their other noodle dishes very greasy  their cold selections of appetitors are delish    i was a bit  shocked that they don't have rice dishes  ask if they can prepare cook it and told that they only cook what's on the menu   i will only  go back because my husband loves their juicy bun  do not expect good service 
cheap and good  the soup buns are only $6!!! the inside is cool as well  you can see them making the food and it's pretty big  3 sections total  i always get their ice soy milk and the fried rice  nice place to eat good chinese food  great place!
service is horrible food is decent   got 2 xiao lung bar (one pork and one with crab meat)  skin was not too thick and was able to hold a lot of soup and moist meaty filling   tripe and beef was delicious and numbingly spicy   sweet rice dumplings were also good so why 2 stars?  we got a soy milk drink and when they brought it  there were food on the lid   what did they do? wiped it out with their hands in front of us and walked away as if nothing happened   when we asked questions they either avoid us or come to us in an annoyed facial expression after we ate and paid  they actually stopped us asking for more tips    we had tipped them the amount we thought appropriate for their lack of service  if they want more tips  then please act the role of a good server  smile  and do a better serving job!even if the food is decent  with this kind of attitude and service  i would rather never come again 
i've been eating chinese food my whole life in the nj ny area  this is by far the best chinese food i've ever eaten  i was in the flushing area of queens for a concert and went to yelp to find some food for a late dinner  im glad i decided to come here  we ordered crab dumplings  seafood soup  and pork in fried noodles  now they make all the pasta for the noodles and the dumplings in house  and you can tell  the dumplings tasted so fresh and delicious we didn't even need soy sauce for dipping  im used to jersey dumplings where the pasta is almost rubbery  these dumplings where lite and melted in our mouths  the broth for the soup was phenomenal  even better than a typical ramen place  the seafood in the soup was very fresh tasting and the shrimp was perfectly cooked  there was noodles in the soup and my wife finished them all that's how i know the pasta was great because she didn't typically eat carbs  there was other fish in there but we didn't know what kind  but it was still great  my pork and noodle dish was perfect  not to saucy and gunky like your typical chinese take out place  this place has long lines and 90% of the people who eat there are asian so you know its great authentic food  if your in the area and hungry def try this place you won't regret it 
get the soup dumplings! i advise you to order the spup dumplings asap  i ususally order them first and order rhe rest of my food afterwards because of the long wait time for the soup dumplings 
decent chinese joint in flushing that is open late everything is pretty average here and i usually stick with the small plate choices that they have in the prepped food trays   i like the fact that they have a decent amount of choices   although  somehow i always end up getting similar things   the xlb and dumplings here are ok; nothing out of this world  i ordered fried dumplings that came out within seconds   i mean it literally   seconds    were they really for someone else   ?  didn't care   ate them anyway service is pretty sparse and you may have to throw a spoon at someone to get a little love and attention   don't worry   spoons are plastic   ain't gonna hurt nobody   
i feel other reviewers have done a great job expressing how great the soup dumplings are  haven't seen enough praise for the beef chive pancake  they use a great sauce with it and its truly amazing  also i don't understand what everyone is talking about in regards to the wait  i have been a few times and it wasn't an issue  i went even today in peak waiting time on a holiday and we waited about 10 15 minutes but it was very organized and the staff very attentive and helpful  not only the best dimsum in flushing but the best in nyc 
this is my first time to eat shanghai food  xiao long bao is very special  i think i might come back 
came here on a saturday afternoon and there was a 15 20 mins wait for a party of 3  we ordered 1 pork soup dumplings  1 crab meat with pork soup dumpling  shanghai shao mai and shanghai pan fried u don to share  the shanghai pan fried u don came out within 5 mins after placing our order whereas the soup dumplings took over 30 35 mins to come out  i understand that the soup dumpling takes longer to cook but there was another party of 8 that place their orders after i did and received their soup dumplings first  everything was alright but i've had better soup dumplings else where  i would not recommend the shanghai shao mai because the shrimp pasta made it taste a bit off 
if you are in queens or willing to go there this is a must ! the wait can be long at times but well worth it ! the soup dumplings   both steamed and fried   are delicious 
as with many of the busy places in flushing  the food is stellar but the service subpar  the waiters and waitresses aren't the nicest or friendly  but dude  those soup dumplings! little hot pockets of soupy happiness that will make you forget about that surly host  don't go during prime time because you'll always wait  we've gone a few times friday around 8 30pm and easily snag a table for two  spicy shredded beef noodles in soup  pan fried pork buns (yum!)  dumplings  and stir fried shanghainese style rice cakes are our go to  )
came in after seeing they had a little following on yelp    went with soup dumplings and noodles    both were great with a nice scoop of chili paste     prices are reasonable and service is friendly
best soup dumplings around  every time i'm in ny i stop by here  they are open early and late too  6 pork soup dumplings for $5 95 and the ones with crab for $1 more  i've also had their soy milk cold and it is really good too  not too sweet with too much sugar  the scallion pancake is also really good  overall they are preparing good food and for a good price too 
soup dumpling is definitely a recommended dish here   we tried this and could not stop on just two case and had to order more   great place  very busy at night so i do recommend to drop in reserve at once   i don't think they accept phone reservation but i would recommend to call in to check the statues before going 
legit xiao long bao and northern chinese food  was quoted a 25 min wait on a weekend for lunch but ended up waiting only 10 minutes for table of 2  service is quick but they seemed short staffed so there were quite a few tables empty even with a line outside  we ordered hot soy bean milk in both sweet and salty  i grew up drinking sweet soy bean milk so it hit the spot  i never tried the salty version before which came with the fried dough that you usually eat with congee floating in it  it has the same consistency as the sweet soy bean milk but just blander  it was salty at all  pan fried udon   i love shanghai noodles because they're not too salty and the fact that the noodles are nice and chewy  the dish was mainly noodles with a little pork and bok choy mixed in  shanghai siumai   these are siu mai with rice inside instead of pork and shrimp  i've never tried this version and actually prefer it over the dim sum version  replace scallion pancake and beef scallion pancake   both good but i preferred the regular pancake without the beef  xiao long bao   very good  came with 6 pieces
delicious xiao long bao  waitresses are very attentive and prices are reasonable  i will definitely be back on my next trip to ny
the best soup dumplings in ny  skin is super thin and holds the soup  our go to order is the pork soup dumplings  garlic cucumber  spicy beef tendon  pan fried pork buns  and beef and chili pepper noodle soup  service is quick but not the friendliest   they just want you in and out  expect a wait on the weekends  cash only 
food still great but get rid of the cashier girl  her apathy and lack of class is beyond rude and annoying 
my favorite soup dumpling place of all time  it is cheap  quick and delicious! highly recommend the shanghai pan udon and the scallion pancakes with beef along with the soup dumplings  i always have a good meal here  and it never lets me down  i would say try not to go on sundays since it does get very busy here and there can be a line!
like so many people i came here for the soup dumplings  being a big fan of joe shanghai's soup dumplings  i decided to give it a try because my friend said they were better than joe's  i thought the dumplings were as good but not necessarily better  in other words  they were delicious!! and i would recommend getting the soup dumplings here  i also ordered pan fried dumplings  which were good but not as good as the soup dumplings  i believe this place also got a michelin mention  so expects lines  i'm giving four stars for the dumplings  the broth inside was very flavorful  it's definitely worth checking out 
yummy taiwanese breakfast style place  but expect a long wait on weekends  i love that it has savory soy milk  fried oil sticks  and soup buns  the main star of the this place are the soup buns  of which my favorite would be the crab & pork ones  the soup is delicious and the meat is tender  while the skin is nice and thing  but not broken the savory soy milk is regular hot soy milk with vinegar to curdle like tofu  then various fixings are added in  i like to get an extra order of the fried oil sticks and dip them into my soy milk  this should also be done if you order a bowl of the sweet soy milk i enjoyed the beef wrapped in fried scallion pancake with an oyster sauce  the only issue with ordering this is that i always feel like a ball of oil afterwards  the little random cold dishes are a hit or a miss  i've had the cucumber which is nice  but kind of soggy  the wood ear mushrooms are delicious 
oh hello delicious soup dumplings  nan xiang is my all time favorite joint to get soup dumplings  they're consistently well made (if you dine in the main area  you can watch the pros make 'em)   never overly salted  because let's face it  too much salt will kill a meal; good meat to wrapper ratio; and the soup   so good their scallion pancakes with beef are quite tasty as well  they're especially good with the garlicky cucumbers in the side  the cucs are refreshing compared to the (greasy) scallion pancakes  the only downfall is that you have to wait a while for the soup dumplings to come out! but that's what you get for great quality 
the last two times my boyfriend and i visited nan xiang xiao long bao we were pretty satisfied with the service and the food quality  but third time wasn't a charm  we came around 2 3pm on a saturday afternoon and it wasn't very crowded  nor busy  they usually give customers a number while they are waiting to be called  but we didn't receive any number until 5 10 minutes at the restaurant  we sat in a different dining area section that we typically do  we knew exactly what we wanted to order  so we ordered away  other customers after us were sitting a few tables away from us too  but they all received their orders faster than we did  we were already starving  but after 15 20 minutes (already 2 30pm 2 45pm) our food still didn't come not even my cold soy milk which doesn't take any time to make  as i've ordered soy milk before  we flagged down our waitress to ask her about our food and my boyfriend told her that everyone that came at the same time we did or after got all of their food except for us  we tried to flag down someone that appeared managerial  but his back was turned to us most of the time  our waitress didn't have a real reason as to what caused our food to take forever and she also seemed to be avoiding us the third or fourth time she came to our table  she brought a plate of garlic cucumbers as a sign of an apology  but it didn't help much and we also didn't eat it  after a 30 45 minute wait  my soy milk and our rice cake  soup dumplings  and scallion pancake finally arrived! the food was good quality as always  but honestly i lost my appetite after a major delay in our food arriving to our table  i am quite sure that our waitress put in our order late or gave some of our food to another table  as the other customers looked more like tourists  i used to like coming here for good soup dumplings  but after this service and experience   no more 
i was looking for soup dumpling near me  foods are very reliable price and taste was greet! i will definitely come back
i do like the menu with pictures  and the restaurant is spacious the xiao long baos here are a little bigger than the ones i'm use to  just a tad  and they are juicier  for the average price of $1 piece  they come in an order of 6  instead of 10  which is nice  the tongs are a nice touch the beef noodle soup lacks in taste and the noodles texture type didn't go well to bring the experience together  i would have preferred a thicker noodle (maybe torn noodles) and a richer broth  i've had mama lu's  roc  and 101 noodle express to name the larger taiwanese chains to compare beef noodle soup (from los angeles)  the green beans in the soup was confusing  maybe it's a variation i just wasn't use to i ordered the soy milk with the youtiao   for a typical taiwanese experience  but the hot soy milk   didn't taste fresh (maybe a porcelain bowl would have made it taste better   i don't make sense as it spilled on me when i tried to drink it)  come here for the xiao long baos    but flushing has so many places selling them  i'm not sure you need to stop by this place for them verdict  3 5 stars  but i feel the beef noodle soup could be so much better    it's a taiwanese staple!
came in the morning and gladly saw only one person ahead of me  i asked the lady in the front for a table of one and she nodded  i waited for about 15 min  until someone else came in and ask for a table of two and the lady at the desk and gave them a ticket number  so i asked her if i should have gotten one too but she kind of just ignored me  the service is not that great  it took forever to get me seated and even longer for the food to come  i got the soup dumplings  which were fairly good but i wouldn't come back just for it 
the soup dumplings and noodles are to die for! their scallion pancakes are also amazing!!!!! actually everything here is amazing and cheap! whenever i come i order a bunch of different things and share it amongst the table so we all get to try something new! absolutely love coming to this place! also there is a municipal parking lot across the street which makes this location very convenient!
i heard about this place for soup buns  everyone said try this place and i finally did  the place is small  i got there at 2 45 and there was people waiting to get a table  restaurant is cash only  waited 15 mins  ordered soup buns one pork and one crab meat with pork  very very tasty  the crab meat better than the pork buns  also we ordered seafood pan fried udon noodles and a ordered of veggie dumplings  the noodles portion was small but tasty  the veggie dumplings needed additional seasoning  a lot of greens in veggie dumplings  very plain  i should've gotten another crab pork soup bun  i definitely would come back 
nan xiang is my favorite xiao long bao spot in flushing  the service is pretty good even when the restaurant itself is packed  we got a dozen of the crab meat ones  the pan fried dumplings  and the scallion pancake  the price for all of that was fairly cheap as well! i'll be back very soon 
i was brought here by a friend who swore by their soup dumplings  i would imagine a restaurant with "xiao long bao" in their name must have the audacity to really know how to make a killer xlb  anyways  it was friday night at 6 00pm and there was a half full (or half empty   whatever floats your boat) restaurant  our party of 4 was greeted by the kind host (who can speak english and chinese) who also sat us down when you come to a place with "xiao long bao" as part of the restaurants name you are basically forced to try their signature dish  wow  these were the soupiest soup dumplings i've tried in the nyc area  i was "wowed"   which normally takes a lot for someone like me  if you've read my other reviews i on dim sum or soup dumplings i've given nearly everyone a 3  nan xiang xiao long bao surpasses those restaurants and earned itself a 4  why not a 5? i wasn't "wowed" by the service or cleanliness of the restaurant  though the cleanliness is enough to be acceptable by the health department  it seemed like the back of the house was kind of dirty (concerning for a health freak like me)  in addition the service was sub par for a relatively easy friday night  we ordered the scallion pancake  pork soup dumplings  and crab soup dumplings and it took what felt like 20 30 minutes  besides the slow service and the unsanitary appearance  the food was absolutely amazing  i am definitely coming back to show friends!
i don't think this is the best soup dumplings  but they're definitely very good  i think i have an issue with the fact that they're not hot enough when they're served  so the soup starts to coagulate and doesn't taste as good  the scallion pancake with beef is definitely a must  they also serve tao foo fah aka taho for filipinos  i think it's listed as a soft soy bean curd  cash only but don't expect to be spending too much as everything is pretty cheap!
the level of consistency here is pretty amazing   i had this like 6 years ago and had a similar solid experience  get the pork soup dumplings and scallion fried pancakes  make sure to eat the dumplings the authentic way by dipping it in the black vinegar  holding it in a spoon  and drinking the soup  service is what you'd expect from a chinatown joint and it's cash only but we're here for the food 
it's really hard to not order everything off the menu here   everything is freshly made and super authentic  don't be scared off by a line  the wait moves very quickly and it only took about 20 minutes to be seated on the weekend  definitely do not pass on the soup dumplings   get several orders! they are the best i've had in nyc and maybe all of america    i also loved the salty sticky rice rolls (fan tuan)  spicy beef & tripe  and the stir fried rice cakes with chicken  the iced soy milk is also super tasty  all the food here brings me back to my visits to shanghai  and the prices aren't too inflated either  service might be a little slow hard to grab their attention as with many chinese restaurants  so don't be afraid to speak up if you need something highly recommend!!
definitely must try  we went and not one server spoke english so we just pointed at things and they brought them to us  the power of hand gestures  everything was fresh  piping hot  and delicious  the service  friendly  even with the language barrier  the place stays packed  so expect a few mins wait  its totally worth the wait  and then our check came and we thought it was a mistake  we couldn't read the language so we told her   we ate so much  this can't be right  turns out  it was correct  sooo cheap  and immediately added to our rotation  don't know how they do it  but we're mighty happy they're doing it 
i came here twice with people who heard how hype this place was  i came and left both times in a disappointment  xiao long bao was average  didn't find the soup to be tasty  shanghai noodles  the noodles were very firm and salty scallion pancake  was crispy (the only thing i kinda like)cold beef flank and slice meat  was good  it had enough spice to it  i wouldn't get out of my way to come to this particular establishment 
went here after work to have dinner with a few close friends  in the cold weather winter we were in a mood for soup dumplings  this place offers two versions of soup dumplings  one is just pork and the other is pork and crab  we decided to try both to see which one we liked better  all of us agreed that the pork and crab soup dumplings had a more rich and complex flavor than the pork ones  we decided to order another two rounds of the pork and crab soup dumplings  of course to eat soup dumplings  don't make the rookie mistake of biting into the dumpling  make sure you rest the soup dumpling in your soup spoon and use your chopstick to poke a hole in dough of the dumpling to let the broth seep out into the spoon  then sip the soup until the dumpling is empty and finally eat the dumpling  i only docked the place a star since they don't have a huge selection of other dishes in addition to the soup dumplings  service is okay  but could be better 
one of the most reviewed and well rated restaurants in downtown flushing   decided to meet up with my aunt for a catch up early dinner before the rush  our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs but since everything was so fairly priced  we sampled a little bit of everything  cold sweet soy milk   authentic chinese soy milk  nothing like the boxed stuffs in the american grocery stores  smooth and chilled   thirst quenching! crab and pork soup dumplings   best of the best! fist sized   stuffed with fillings  so so juicy  and bursting of flavors  pan fried dumplings   these weren't served until we were half way through all the other foods but they were definitely worth the wait  the pan fried skin   crispy yet chewy  the filling again was stuffed! shanghainese noodle   a bit too greasy but still very yummy  the noodle was perfectly chewy  there were lots of veggies and shredded pork mixed within  beef scallion rolls   too much of the sweet soy sauce  the beef was a bit tough  not as good as ones i had in other shanghainese restaurants  red bean puffs   we weren't sure what to expect based on the chinese and english name  tiny sweet bean filled puff pastries   the skin was a little too thick  filling was lacking the sweet red beans  nice try but wouldn't get them again  overall    service was standard chinese  foods were for the majority hits! traditional shanghainese cuisine done right 
this joint serves shanghai style dim sum  they don't have the steel carts being wheeled around  however what they do have are pre prepared cold dishes you can find in most of the shanghai nese restaurants  in addition  they also have the traditional dumpling fare including soup dumplings  pan fried dumplings  dumpling soup  i'm a fan of wheat based chinese foods  so this was a nice fit if you're really looking for the traditional chinese breakfast  especially in the north   try the fried dough with warm soy milk and add a side of salt soy bean curd 
very horrible service waitress is horrible and no manners  bad experience on chinese new year day!shorty after  2 guys look like from ny dept walked in and told all the customers to leave immediately and do not worry about the bill 
came back again today for lunch  and i must say that the visit was perfect  we ordered one streamed pork bun  pan fried pork bun  scallion pancake with sliced beef  braised beef noodle soup  and rice cake with shredded pork and preserved mustard to go  this was my first time ordering the beef noodle soup  and it's great i did  the soup was tasty and not very spicy (despite the intense red color)  the noodles weren't overlooked and the beef was very tender instead of ordering too much and getting too full like last time  i took it slower  i also didn't eat more than two bites of the scallion pancake because too much oil makes my stomach hurt in addition to avoiding a stomachache  the service was also very pleasant  though the interactions were brisk and efficient    as they typically are when eating at authentic chinese restaurants    the wait staff was pleasant  my girlfriend and i waited a bit for water because the restaurant ran out of clean cups  but the waiter seemed apologetic  it was all good  five stars for this visit!
i heard this place was famous and my boyfriend was very eager to take me here  i always had the rule of thumb that you would know if the restaurant is good and authentic if you look at their clientele  that being said  it looks like they are more catered to the general american public  we ordered the the pork soup dumpling  vegetable dumpling and their beef pancake  pork soup dumpling   good and savory but only for the first couple of dumplings until the pork "after taste" comes  vegetable dumpling   it was very dry and bland  beef pancakes   definitely have had better  the beef cut was too thick and dry  the pancake itself is too thick and they smothered it  with sauce to try to hide the "dryness" of it  i wish i could recommend another place close by but if ever you find yourself in los angeles califonia  101 noodle in san gabriel valley will surely hit the spot for beef pancakes   din tai fung will satisfy your soup dumpling cravings 
four of us came here on sunday for lunch around 1130 and didn't have to wait for a table  got seated in the main dining area when you walk in  although  it seems they've expanded quite a lot over the years  we ordered two baskets of xiao long bao and a handful of other side dishes  (a bit too much food to be honest) while all the dishes came reasonably quick; the xiao long bao took a while  so try not to fill up on the small appetizers  overall  everything tasted great and was reasonably priced  the one star lost is due to the lackluster service and you kind of get the feeling they are just trying to turn as many tables as possible 
love their soup dumplings and it's cheap  it's a cash only place  and people complain about servers not being friendly  but i don't care i'm not trying to be their friend just pass me the soup dumplings so i can eat
i love soup dumpings and this place does not dissapoint  i remember coming here as a kid with my grandparents and we would get the soup dumplings  beef scallion pancake  fried dough and sweet soymilk  that would be the best breakfast ever! i've come here a few times this past year  and i've noticed that they don't make the beef scallion pancake as well as they used to  but it's still good  if you ever come to flushing  this place is a must try  the soup dumplings is juicy and delicious and the soymilk just makes everything better  must try!
i try their soup dumping during their first few months of opening  that was really really good! the outer layer was very thin  but just enough to hold the filling when you pick up the   dumping and put it on your spoon  the service was good  the cashier was nice  so they should have my 5 stars   until people start waiting  and they become famous   now  i get attitude from the waiter or waitress when take more than few minute to order  the soup dumping outer layer is so thick  i actually talk to the manager about that  and he respond that the thick layer will be easy for most of the people eat it without losing any soup  and i don't really believe it  that's should be easy for them to make the thick layer instead of the thin layer one good thing is they still able to keep the taste for the soup dumping  for other foods  the taste is about standard or maybe even below standard  but who cares  i believe people come here are for the soup dumping only one last tip for everyone  don't order the crab meat soup dumping  the reason is they don't put much crab meat and there is no big difference and you can't really tell  so don't order the "over price" crab meat one  just stick with the regular one 
i like to come here after getting a happy ending cus it really is like the icing on the cake or cherry on the whatever they say 
came here last night around 7 15pm with my girlfriend and it appeared to be quite busy  we were first on waiting list and just stood off to the side of the counter after being told we could sit next  then another couple came in and got seated before us! we asked the hostess why they seated them first after we had came in first and she said "i don't know" then i asked her in mandarin she suddenly seated us a table immediately which was empty the entire time  last night we got the pork soup dumplings  crab pork soup dumplings (had literally crab shells in them which i had to pull out)  scallion pancake with beef  fried bean gluten (looked old)  and the spicy beef noodle soup (shouldn't have ordered)  after putting in our order our food came pretty quick but they gave us the wrong scallion pancake so we had to send that back  overall  i'm only coming here for the scallion pancake with beef and the prices are great  but that's not even worth the under average service  i'd rather go to their new competitor shanghai you garden two blocks down for soup dumplings 
this spot is usually my go to for xlb (xiao long bao) and  i've been going here for quite some time but this bad review is for that particular waiter that usually works on the left section of the restaurant  among a few things that we ordered was the scallion pancake with beef dish  when some of the food finally arrived to the table  he puts down the scallion pancake (only) dish  i notified him that wasn't what we ordered and he replied back (in mando) saying  "it was made already and i can't take it back but if you want to add in an order the scallion pancake with beef you can " (  !?) i've never gotten that customer service before where the waiter doesn't fix his own mistake and tell us to pay for another one  that's just very disappointing 
i come here with my brother often but not as often as we used to  we order udon noodles  beef roll and two orders of pork soup dumplings  it's reasonably priced and the staff are quite courteous 
came friday right before noon and beat the busy lunch time rush  good amount of seating and fast service  1) steamed pork and crab soup dumplings   (5 5) the soup is very flavourful and the dumplings held a crazy amount of soup in them  one of the most delicious ones i've had2) beef noodle soup   (4 5) handmade noodles with clear flavour not too intense  not very spicy which is perfect for me but watch the green peppers  beef is very soft to he point of being too soft if that's possible  3) beef pancakes   (4 5) great flavour and new take  the crust is like you tiao and deliciously crunchy 
solid food at great prices!! the xlb is perfect; the meat to soup ratio is spot on  and the dumpling skin is just the right thickness  an order comes with 6 and costs $5 95 (+$1 for crab+pork filling)  the cold appetizers were delicious (try the fried bean gluten; trust me  it tastes way better than it sounds!) the noodles are average and not much better than ones you would get from a fast food joint  skip this  and go for the items with the bizarre names they also have a great breakfast menu  which we were allowed to order from at dinner time  the scallion pancake with sliced beef is the best i've ever had! a super crispy and flaky pancake with juicy  tender meat in the center  a little oily though  but that's prob why it tasted so damn good  1 star for being cash only and for having flimsy  dirty laminated menus that have seen better days 
unbelievable food    and you can eat the whole menu for $30   i still dream of this place regularly   traveled from suffolk county today pork buns  beef rice cake  cucumber salad  beef udon  scallion pancake  beef & chili pepper soup 
came here after a long day of moving into my new apartment in astoria! i think we came on an off day and time (lunch on thursday at 3 45 pm  anyone?) so we were seated right away  i was with my chinese speaking family  so communicating and ordering with the wait staff was easy and enjoyable  i'm not sure if my experience would have changed were i not with my family  but i'll give them the benefit of the doubt (they even asked to what family we had left in china taiwan  what they were up to    chinese culture  y'all)  we ordered our food  getting a shacha (asian sauce) beef stir fry noodles  beef noodle soup  beef green onion pancake roll  steamed char siu buns and a couple of soup dumpling orders to split in our party of four  our orders actually took longer than expected  for there not being that many people in the restaurant but everything was solid and pretty authentic  i really liked the soup dumplings  get the pork and cabbage ones!! probably some of the best i've had in new york  unfortunately  they did forget the char siu buns that we'd ordered so we were left sitting at the end of our meal waiting for the buns    i think we waited about 15 minutes before my dad gave up and asked for the check  they asked if we wanted to wait a little bit and have the buns boxed and we could take them to go  but we declined  overall good eating experience though  i'd go again if i were in flushing but wouldn't make the long af trip out to flushing to go again  would recommend to anyone looking for nan xiang food (or authentic chinese) in flushing!
these soup dumplings are amazing  it is perfectly made each time and is packed with flavor  there are many restaurants in flushing who sells soup dumplings but this is the only place that really satisfies my soup dumpling needs  absolutely a place to try out when you are in the area  the pork soup dumplings go for $6 50 for 6 which is a pretty solid deal  they have other great selections but i only get soup dumplings when coming here  the wait time is usually swole around 7 9 pm for dinner and 12 2 pm for lunch so get there alittle early to beat the line 
a no frills dumpling and noodle joint that really hits the spot  the decor    well  there isn't any  and the great service    well  there isn't any of that either  but if you're looking for delicious shanghai style noodles and dumplings that are made to order  this is the spot! i always order the shanghai pan fried noodles and the steamed pork dumplings  the pan fried dumplings are also good but i find the steamed to be more moist  the menu is very simple  a two sided laminated sheet has some pictures and the back is the list with prices  they come around and refill your hot tea for free which is nice if you don't order a beer cash only is the only downside
wow  just wow  i've been going to joe's for years  and i'm disappointed that i've never encountered this establishment  13 10 shanghai pan fried udon ($6 95) 5 5   the noodles were pretty greasy and kinda lacked flavor  but the bok choy mixed well with the noodles  and the small beef strips were a great addition  definitely recommend due to its great price and amountscallion pancake with sliced beef ($3 95?) 7 5   uhhhhhh get this please  no regretsshanghai shao mai ($2 95) 2 5   tastes pretty bad  i don't recommend this to be honestcrab and pork soup dumplings ($6 95) 6 5   tastes sooooooooo good  make sure you eat this while it's hoti came here for the reviews  left with a full  satisfied stomach  between 3 people  we all ended up only paying $10 each  amazing  life changing  a revelation  definitely going to come here at least 4 times a month
i was getting my car worked on in the area  saw all the reviews on yelp so i decided to stop in  the place was pretty busy but i had no issues finding a seat  i ordered the crab & pork steamed bun and shao mai  it was real good  hit the spot   i'm coming back here with friends in a week or so to try some of their other items  glad i found a new spot for grub  also it doesn't hurt that it was inexpensive =)
a bit disappointed the last time was here  xiao long bun  which are usually fresly made  steamy hot and juicy  were just average  i think the waiter waited too long to bring them to the table as they were cold when we got them  don't expect much of a service  evdn though they have a lot of waiters and waitresses  it takes forever to call tgeir attention and get something  other food is just average 
short versiongood  great xlb  tasty scallion pancakes  a variety of shanghainese specialties  in general all their food is great bad  cash only  service is hit or miss  long wait  long versionthere is a great variety of food here  my father is from shanghai and loves his shanghainese breakfast food like salty soymilk and fried cruller  they do both very well here  their scallion pancakes is also very good  crispy  fragrant  and good portion  the xlb is actually not the best i've ever had  that goes to kung fu xiao long bao  but these xlb are no slouch  the skin is not as thin but the meat is very flavorful  there's sufficient amount of soup in the bao  unless you really  really like crab stay away from the crab xlb  it's not really worth the extra money for a small taste of crab meat  they have expanded but the wait is still sometimes ridiculous  try to come on a weekday and bring cash    lots of it 
finally came here for the first time on a saturday around 4pm which is an odd time   too late for lunch and too early for dinner so there was no line! the soup dumplings were ok   the best i've ever had? no  better than joe's? i don't think so  but i do appreciate that these were bigger  bigger dumplings = more soup! we also ordered a pan fried noodle dish with chicken  this was also just ok  chicken was a bit dry and the noodles were more wet than crispy  overall  just ok for a cheap and fast meal in flushing 
this is my go to place for soup dumplings  its perfect to eat them especially during the winter  it tastes even better when you pour soy sauce and a piece of ginger inside of the dumpling  i always order scallion pancakes and sprinkle sugar on them  must try them!!
delicious soup dumpling  i like the crab and pork way better than just the pork soup dumplings 
utterly fantastic  great food  lots of choices  reasonably priced and very convenient  i was most impressed with the glutton tofu  oh my gosh! you can't tell it's tofu! great pan fried noodles too  big thumbs up!
soy milk and you tiao  chinese fried dough is the best combo for breakfast  it's one of the most traditional chinese breakfast  i am also a big fan of chives pancake  chive is a green vegetable with a special aroma  since i don't eat red meat anymore  i don't order xiao long bao anymore  i like to order the cold dishes  cucumber and seaweed  very refreshing  the price can't be more decent 
this place is legit  we finally had a chance to visit flushing during our trip to nyc  we came to nanxiang after eating at joe's steamed rice rolls (which was also amazing)  although we were so full after joe's  we still ordered 2 orders of xlb and pan fried pork buns  not sure if this nanxiang is affiliated with the og one in shanghai  this location doesn't disappoint if you are looking for authentic xlb and shanghainese food!
food comes almost immediately (dumplings take long though)  everything tastes really good  only thing that's kind of annoying is that it's cash only  service is ok  not great especially not during peak hours  but that's normal  good place to grab a quick lunch 
it was   okay  scallion pancake just tasted like grease  steamed buns and dumplings were okay   the broth was a little too fatty for my taste  udon noodles were the best part 
i've been a regular here since they only had two store fronts and getting tables fri sun nights were an absolute struggle  glad to see they got another room to feed all their soup dumpling loving customers! i never been to a soup dumpling place better than nan xiao long bao and their cheap price seals the deal  i also usually get the lettuce and pork noodle soup but the size of the bowl shrunk since 4 years ago  but i honestly don't mind because you still get your money's worth  service is not the best but i go for the food not the service try their breakfast items too! i sometimes get the red bean puffs for dessert and they come out steaming hot and crispy 
woke up early cause of day light saving so we went here for breakfast  omg!!! it's delicious!!! even our picky eater kids loved their soup dumplings  will definitely be back!
not as good as chinatown ones  taste is not strong enough  just as normal as other street stores  many ppl wait in line just cuz the famous name and long history  but i don't think it keep the performance standard hight
the soup dumplings and the beef scallion pancakes were a++  the pan fried dumplings bordered bad  practically no meat inside  the shanghai shao mai are apparently popular  but fell flat  but still  i can tell the place delivers with the monday night crowd and large menu  and the two dishes that were better  i absolutely loved 
the food was okay   in comparison to the other restaurants in flushing   the soup dumplings were the best thing from this place  the pan friend noodles are alright  the service was okay forgot to bring the dumplings but he was nice about it    besides that everything else was okay  
i have been here sooooo many times and i never leave disappointed  the service is very fast (unless they forget a part of your order  which has happened to me more than once and is the only reason why the lose a star)  order both flavors of soup dumplings (that's why you're there  right?)  scallion pancakes  and rice cakes  none of the other dishes are worth your time  quick service  extremely affordable  and delicious food  as they say in basketball  this place is a slam dunk!
i came here for dim sum thinking they have a lot of varieties to choose from but it wasn't the typical dim sum  the food was alright   nothing special  my friend and i came out full but not fully satisfied  while exploring the area  we were like we should have ate here or here or here but it must be me   because this place gets really pack  must be the noodle soup   that looks good  didn't order it but it looked good 
if you ever have the chance to visit  you must order the beef pancake  it is soooo good!!! the hype about the soup dumplings are true  they melt nicely in your mouth and the flavors are wonderfully situated  love the food here  soups  noodles etc 
this place seems to always be packed and it has a great reputation  the soup dumplings are really good and i'm a huge fan of the beef scallion pancakes  the service is pretty good and the prices are not bad one downside i have  though  is that one out of the two times i've been here  my spoon smelled very very strongly of a bathroom odor  the second time  my spoon was fine but my friend's had that same smell  even after asking for another spoon  it smelled the same  i'm not sure why no one else smells it  or maybe it just isn't as strong to them as it is to me however  it did have an impact on my experience  the second time eating there was much better than the first 
came here on a saturday around 5 45 and didn't have to wait for a table for 2  we weren't super hungry  but wanted to eat something before we headed back to manhattan  service was meh   it took us forever to get seated because the hostess just seemed to ignore my presence for 5 minutes? the servers were nice  but not really attentive; we had a back table so we had to keep trying to flag their attention  we ordered  cucumber and garlic   this is the perfect appetizer when you want to order something lighter  the flavors are subtle  yet satisfying  the pickled cucumber reminds me of a home cooked meal  we didn't expect it to be as good as it was scallion pancake with beef   a normal scallion pancake stuffed with beef and peking duck sauce  you can't really go wrong with that combination  but i found that the whole thing just tasted like the sauce  not bad  but not particularly impressive either  xlb   good  but not blow your mind good if you've had a lot of xlb in the past at places like din tai fung  i've definitely have xlb with thinner skin before  the soup inside was flavorful total came to $20 after tip  i'll probably be back to fulfill any xlb cravings unless i find somewhere better 
shhh shh  it's okay  nothing lasts forever nan xiang is still an acceptable option   on par with joe's shanghai   for soup dumpling newbies wanting a 小籠包 experience that probably won't suck  the wildly popular restaurant has expanded into either of the spaces beside it  the menu is entirely in english with photos  and waitstaff are more than ready to jump in in english if your chinese falters for a second but as far as the *best* xiao long bao in nyc? alas  no more  the xlb had always been inconsistent  but the majority of my visits are now disappointing  the dumplings are still huge  filled preposterously with lovely gelatinous broth    but the skins have been too thick  never as tender as they used to be  considering an order is more expensive than others in the area  it's no longer worth it i didn't mention in my last review that all the noodle dishes on the rest of the menu are actively bad  we used to order noodles here solely to fill up (can't eat a meal consisting only of soup dumplings!) but i realized eventually that i've literally never enjoyed them   bland  greasy  often just starch and sauce  i'm giving up once a bright spot on the menu  even the taiwanese breakfast has become subpar  the 油條 (chinese cruller) is half the size it used to be  the soy milk served tepid  the scallion pancake beef roll features a thoroughly blistered pancake  deep fried at such low temperatures that it's oil logged  worse  the paltry amount of sliced beef inside is an insult  i don't think beef needs to be the center of this dish  but come on  nan xiang  you've brought in tons of revenue from good press over the years  at least try to deserve it they're still cash only  they're still busy no matter the time of day  and i'm sure they won't miss my business 
the food has been good 2 out of 3 times i've been here my last eat was crispy seafood noodlessteamed pork dumplingsfood is satisfying but not something to write home about i wouldn't say these are the best soup dumplings but they taste very good waiters are there to only order your food and bring it to you  they don't check to see if you need anything more after that nan xiang is open a bit later than other restaurants in the area  so its not a bad choice if you're out and want some decent food  just don't expect great service 
cash only  don't expect good service stick w the soup dumpling and handmade (smaller 8 pcs) dumpling  i didnt like the siomai it's fake  rice and  no meat  fgats dissappointing
have been here a few times previously and went again this past week while in flushing  huge thunderstorm hit on a wednesday evening so no lines which was a good thing  had to order the xlb  the pan fried pork buns  the beef wrapped in scallion pancake  rice cake with pork and sour cabbage which are our go to dishes  all are very good but my favorites are the pan fried pork buns and the beef in scallion pancake   can't go wrong here although the service can be quite slow and they only take cash   so be ready
came here for dim sum menu on a sunday afternoon and was pleased with the food and flavors  this place is strictly about the food and you're in and out  you're not going here for decor or fancy linens  although they can improve on the area by the bathroom  where boxes were exposed to the customers that are seated nearby  the food comes out very fast and it would be helpful if they refilled your tea without having to ask for it or look for a server to refill my cup  the scallion beef pancake was delicious  the pork buns were good  the spicy beef noodle soup was amazing and so was the crunchy noodle seafood  i didn't have to wait long to get a table 
shanghainese is our "flavor of the month" it seems   can't get enough of it we were in the area and decided to try nx    based on the stellar yelp reviews   not much i can add after almost 2000 op eds before mine    other than to say i don't think the food was 4 or 5 star outstanding  the soup dumplings are definitely worth a taste    they are flavorful  "soupy" and texturally perfect    as advertised   but the shanghai shiao mai were very average (shanghai in ft  lee yelp com biz shanghai re… does them far better    more mushrooms  better texture and up tempo  seasoning)   the tea was little more than hot water  disappointing in any chinese restaurant service can be brusque and it is cash only    probably why everything is so cheap    and parking in the area is a bear on sundays   our fried bun (more like empanada) with chives and egg was mostly chives with a dash of egg  lightly fried but with an unpleasant  burned oil after taste that lingered  the crispy noodles with beef and mushrooms was a pleasing study in contrasting texture and flavor   but the saucy beef and mushroom mixture was overly thickened with corn starch and set up unpleasantly with clumps of jello like goo if in the area  i would go back to nx for the xlb    and maybe try a few other dishes    but the limited menu and missteps will probably keep me in nj or chinatown when the shanghainese mood strikes me top tip   use the parking lot in the prince tower    $6 bucks for 2 hours   better than municipal parking with little hassle 
tl;dr  freaking amazing food  freaking horrible service  but you're not here for the ambiance  you're here for the foodgot seated pretty quick  no wait  to be expected as we were there ~10 30 on a thursday morning  still a decent crowd for that time of day though  i'm pretty new to the xlb game but i think i found the all time champs  the xiao long bao here are excellent  even better than din tai fung in my humble opinion  the crab in the xiao long bao is super generous and the dumplings themselves are rather big compared to other xlb places  they're stuffed full of a savory  perfectly seasoned generous pocket of meat with a deliciously soupy  body warming broth inside  everything is so juicy; your eyes will roll to the back of your head when you take your first bite  a must get for sure  if you absolutely have to pick between the two  get the plain pork xlb  while the lump crab flavor was excellent  i found the texture to be ever so slightly distracting from the overall mouth feel  but i'm being nitpicky; just get both of them  doesn't matter if you're eating by yourself  doesn't matter if you're already full  doesn't matter if you're broke  just get both types  worst case  take it home and heat it up and relive the awesomeness again    other dishes we got  scallion pancake with beef  i found a lot of people raving about this but i found it over hyped  yes  it was pretty good but would i order it over a second round of xlb? nah  the hoisin was just a little overpowering  the pastry a little too dry  especially paired with that type of meat  i think it was beef flank  cooked that way  it tends to be dry and chewy  maybe get it once to try it but i found myself wishing i had order more xiao long bao instead  we also got fried dumplings  my so ordered this despite my reasoning that we were at a soup dumpling restaurant (the guy really loves his fried jiaozi)  i regretted my protest after i tried one  i ended up fighting him for the last one  o o  these fried dumplings are probably the best ones i've ever had  incredibly crispy on the outside yet incredibly moist on the inside  they seem to have the same filling as the xlb so they have the same excellently seasoned meat  the best part? there was broth on the inside!!! not as much as the xlb but holy crap  it elevated the dumpling  imagine  biting into a crispy  perfectly doughy crust and then finding a small explosion of delicious pork and juice in your mouth  ;) i liked these almost as much as the xiao long bao so yeah food's good  but service was not  i'd give service probably 1 5 stars  we saw our waitress maybe 3 times  once to bring out tea  once to order food  and once when we got the food  didn't see her to get our check  had to get up and tackle someone else down (not really) but after awkwardly saying excuse me and raising my hand awkwardly for 35 minutes at various staff members  i really had to boogie out of there  but whatever  5 star food and 1 5 star service doesn't equal 4 stars but whatever  food's that good!
this place is a slice of china right in the middle of nyc  this place is authentic chinese food  mostly dumplings  noodles  and dim sum  the service was fast and friendly  with a never ending cup of oolong tea  they had a deep selection of everything  we went for the crab dumplings  scallion pancakes  and seaweed salad  the seaweed salad was crispy and fresh  perfectly marinated  the scallion pancakes tasted like onion filled indian fry bread  crispy  sweet and perfect  we also got some smaller dumplings that seemed to be full of a grain  like bulghar  the prices were quite reasonable  especially considering the quality of the food  the restrooms were inoperable when we came  the waitress suggested that i go a few doors down to the liquor store 
xiao long bao and green onion pancakes pleasantly satisfied my party on a cold and rainy day  my party of seven had come mid afternoon after flying into nyc  the rich broth was perfect for warming us up  the skin of the dumplings were tender while springy  the bing (green onion pancakes) were quite oily  so i would not order it again  the staff refilled our tea plenty of times during our visit 
the staff doesn't have a very good attitude toward customer  but their food is okay  they have pretty good breakfast
the food tastes great here!! but the service is bad!!! no staff care about serving us hot tea! our buns and shumai came in first  when we almost finished the buns and shumai  and after asking the waiter again and again  our soy milk finally came  our appetizer the cold dish came in last! we asked for our check  and again it took them so long to give us  the bad service ruined everything! it's not just a bummer  it's horrible experience!
this is my favorite xaolongbao in new york! (walking distance from 7 train)fun hang out with your friends and slip on the juicy and flavorful dumplings  the place has three different parts for seating with so many different menus  cold appetizers  dumplings  and noodles the people who work here are nice!! for first timer  they have english menu with pictures on one side and more menu on the other side  also  if you are having trouble with anything  dumpling are really delicious and cheap!i usually get cold appetizer  spicy bamboo shoot! it has a sour and tangy flavor on top of spicy oily sauce  the main part is the soup dumpling  you have a choice between just pork or pork and crab meat  both are so good! if i'm hungry or with many people  i get scallion pancake with beef  oily and crispy outside with tangy yet oyster y sauce and beef inside is something to start off your meal right service is not the best but you come here for the food not the service  there is usually a wait here if you come on friday or weekend but usually it is not too long  make sure you remember that "cash only" so bring enough money pay for your food!!
the noodle soup kicks ass and the prices are so good  i think the xiao long bao is a little weak compared to joe's  but then joe has a secret they put lard inside  shhh     girls will like joe's less usually because it is less greasy 
best xiao long bao in nyc  also the beef wrap was tk die for  superpacked on sat  get their a littlelater to get a seat 
met friends here for dinner  i enjoyed the company certainly and the soup dumplings  and the price    but that's it  all other dishes were rather salty or oily  the staff were nice though so a definite plus!! we were also not bumping into the next table as it's common in flushing    again a plus   )
3 5 stars  came here after hearing and reading about all the hype of this michelin recommended spot in flushing  ordered the scallion pancake with sliced beef  the spicy pork and vegetable wontons in peanut sauce  and the famous pork soup dumplings  the scallion pancake that so many on yelp bragged about was disgusting   an overly greasy pile of dough with a razor thin slice of beef and some hoisin sauce  it was something you would get in a ghetto americanized chinese restaurant  however the bad food ended there  the spicy pork and vegetable wontons in peanut sauce were fantastic  and the sauce was the star of the dish   and not overly spicy  the pork soup dumplings (which every packed table ordered) was great  i'll split hairs here and say the dough was a tad too thick  you can actually see the soup broth in other soup dumplings offered at other places in flushing  but these soup dumplings were big  super soupy  and is the reason why this place is known in the area  cash only 
one of the best dumpling spots i've had in the city  unless many places in flushing or in the city  this place stays in touch with their chinese roots  no fancy music  no overpriced bullshit  no over the top decorations to draw in people  just really good food for a good price  they have a very wide selection in their menu  i had a few different varieties of dumplings along with the steamed pork buns  it was all very good  the service was relatively quick and good as well  highly recommend 
although the food is pretty good the host at the front is extremely rude  she doesn't acknowledge you or welcome you when entering the restaurant  also the cleanliness of this restaurant isn't very good  bathroom is disgusting  the top of soda cans are dirty  the floor need to be swept and mopped  and if you can see inside or the kitchen it isn't very clean either  also this place only takes cash to avoid paying there fair amount of taxes so they are getting over on the government and the community 
this review is for the breakfast  namely the you tiao  fan tuan  dou jiang  sheng jian bao  and cong you bing  being a taiwanese american  i simply love taiwanese breakfast  and there really aren't that many options in the area  so i found this place via yelp  the food is definitely quite good  and prices all reasonable  only thing is i came at 10ish in the morning  and they didn't have any fan tuan or sheng jian bao available  so i ended up waiting 20 minutes for them  cashier gave me a tip to call my order in ahead of time next time  which i did  and was very happy with it!tl;dr  call ahead for your breakfast orders otherwise you might wait for the yummy fan tuan and pan fried dumplings!
worst service ever  ordered pan fried pork buns  took a bite into it and saw that the meat was raw  returned it expecting to get a new order  receive my same order (bite mark still visible) just refried  and probably cooked with other buns  at least give me a new order since i couldve been severely sick with the raw meat you tried to serve me also refused to sit my family and i at a preferred table for 8  when the restaurant was completely empty and not busy  and we didn't want to sit by the bathroom kitchen 
this is my second time visiting this place and was the worst experience  food is good  service was horrible  we left the tip we did since all our server did was bring the food and was never to be seen again  the server was so quick to take the checkbook away after we put our cash in the checkbook as we were about to leave  our lady server comes back to us in a nice tone that we didn't leave enough tip  this whole experience  she probably said less than 15 words to us  her tone was especially nice when she found out our tip was not enough i never write reviews on yelp  but this experience really made me mad that they would do that tip is for service  and overall our service was not great please do not demand tip from your customers 
had to get the soup dumplings (they were very good 4 5)   also had the pan fried dumplings (4 5)  chicken in wine sauce (4 5)  cucumber in garlic (5 5)  perhaps a little too authentic for western pallets  but plenty of options to satisfy everyone 
i love this place  i come here for the soup dumplings but i also love the beef pancakes and the spicy beef noodle soup  i fell in love with soup dumplings at din tai  fung here in seattle and i ended up finding this gem of a place in nyc when i wanted my friends there to try them  i try to go to this place every time i'm in ny  the service is very professional  you'll get everything you ask for but don't expect smiling faces  great food  great price
this rating is strictly for the beef noodle soup   i found the noodles to be soggy and likely reboiled   arghhh   what a waste of noodles!  can really make or break a bowl of beef noodle soup   the soup was light and very enjoyable   nice and dark   the beef was tender and broke apart easily   did not see tendon as an option   i am willing to try again as they were packed   this rating doesn't reflect their soup dumplings which are to die for    their soup dumplings and vegetarian steamed dumplings are top notch  but i came here strictly to try their beef noodle soup    there cold dish bar is great   love walking over and picking appetizers  the marinated seaweed and the jellyfish are killer    be prepared to wait will definitely return  i also realized that i did not capture a photograph of the beef noodle soup   i shall return!
the food was amazing  the pork soup dumplings was very juicy  definitely a great place to go with family or luncheon with coworkers  try the crab pork soup dumplings  careful when eating though  the soup was burning hot inside the dumpling 
this is a staple stop for me whenever i'm staying in the flushing area  the prices are super good and the food never disappoints  i almost always get the shanghai noodles and soup dumplings  i also love the hot soy milk and crispy dough to dip in for breakfast  last time i tried the scallion pancake with sliced beef and it is now my new addition to my regular order  a bit on the greasy side  but still a tasty dish overall!
this place used to be better now everything is just pretty greasy and oily and you need extra napkins to wipe your mouth and hands are usually always get the shanghai nice noodles but now they put less meat and vegetables inside the noodles looks like they're getting cheaper the chicken soup used to be very flavorful with chinese herbs and now he's just he's like they throw in a bunch of salt  after you had a meal in this place you really need to chug down two bottles of water cause your mouth will be extremely dry and thirsty  the soy milk is also very water down 
incredible food  we especially enjoyed the pork soup dumplings   the spicy beef & tendon   fantastic!  our first time eating scallion pancake with beef slices very flavorful   we will definitely be back before our trip is over 
i really want to give this place 4 stars but the quality has gone down in its xlb  i'll start with the food  i came with a group of 6 and we ordered multiple orders of the pork xlb and the crab xlb  the xlb came out piping hot which was exciting but the skin texture was much too thick for it to be a xlb  it tasted like a dumpling wrapper and didn't fit the bill  the soup inside the dumplings was also average  it could have used more flavor  the crab one had more flavor in its soup  the actual meat was flavorless  the flavor of the meat just never came out  dissapointing  if you have to order xlb   get the crab one  we also ordered the scallion pancakes with beef  the scallion pancakes are different as they are deep fried so it was super oily  also  they added too much sauce into it and not enough meat  only a few pieces of meat were inside  we also had a few appetizers to begin with  those were on point  real flavorful  we got the bean gluten and the spicy beef with tripe  highly recommend on both  service here was mehhhhh  took multiple times to get water and ginger for our xlb  they were friendly though and spoke english well enough to understand us  i really hope their quality of food comes back up  this used to be my go to spot for xlb but it has regressed and has become your above average  xlb shop 
it's really a toss up between this place  kung fu  and joe's for best soup dumplings  but some of the pork dishes here have made it my top choice  and the prices can't be beat 
i'm impressed with the xlb at nan xiang  i've read some mixed reviews on yelp but happy to say my experience was what i hoped for ordered 2 orders of xlb  1 of the sheng jian bao (pan fried buns which are my white whale)  1 of the guo tie (pan fried dumplings aka potstickers)  1 of the rice cake with pork and preserved cabbage  and 1 of the scallion pancake beef wrap  the potstickers  rice cake  and beef wrap were all nothing to write home about  and varied between eh and decent  i wouldn't waste my time money calories on them next time xlb  next to joe's shanghai ginger  probably my favorite that i've tried in ny  i'll have to return to check on consistency  but i loved the non sweetness of the broth and the well roundedness of the skin  neither too thin or too chewy  they were hot  they were fresh tasting  and they were gone too soon sheng jian  i'm feeling ambivalent about these  on one hand  they're one of the most bready iterations i've ever had   i really got the "bao" part when eating through  that means the broth juice from the insides of the bun gets completely absorbed by the bun itself  i don't like that  on the other hand  however  the resulting soaked bun was incredibly tasty and the meat inside was flavorful  so i wound up eating quite a few and enjoyed them more than i thought i would at first bite  overall  i still haven't found a sheng jian in ny that can stand up to those i used to eat in shanghai  so i'll look on and skip these next time at nan xiang overall  nan xiang's xlbs were definitely worth it  and i'd come back just to have an order or three of them  there's great food worth trying everywhere in flushing  so i don't think i'd order other dishes here again  but i can see myself taking people here for a snack or an early round of restaurant hopping 
yummy soup dumplings! though they are just as good as the ones from joe's shanghai  i recommend the crab and pork soup dumplings  they will come out super steamy hot and we had to wait 5 10 minutes for them to cool down we ordered the spicy tripe as an appetizer and it was extremely spicy (must be the red peppers sprinkled all over and maybe they were doused in hot sauce)  it was difficult to finish such a spicy dish but we managed to with the help of water and hot tea  i also ordered a chicken soup that was basically a watery broth with pieces of bland chicken and bone  the scallion pancakes with sliced beef we ordered were very filling but would be better with some sort of teriyaki sauce lastly  make sure to bring cash because they do not accept card! though  the prices are overall a good deal and cheap  the staff was more direct and rushy rather than friendly  overall  it was nice to try their soup dumplings but we prefer joe's shanghai for next time 
soup dumplings are great  )yes service is not great   don't expect a smile or good attitude from your servers  food is great though  my husband and i only come for the soup dumplings (pork and crab and just pork)  their soy sauce mix thing is amazing also  love the hot tea too  )
this is a popular place with great food  good location  so so service  and no atmosphere   yes  the dumplings are excellent   we had the about six different dishes including the soup dumplings  pan fried dumplings  and pan fried buns   they were all excellent   i would recommend this place to everyone 
if i could give a zero  i would  they had a bug in the beaf and refused to replace it  saying that it was after the fish was given to us  we were so upset that we gave less than one dollar gratitude because they literally gave the worst services and showed no respect to customers  after we paid  they came to us and yelled in front of all people that tips have to be above 15%  when did customers have to pay that much gratitude when they had no service at all? we jut kept walking out and one of the staff still came after us and threw the coins we left to our faces  just one advice  avoid this shitty restaurant if you don't wanna eat bug and get robbed!
so this place features in michelin guide and though the food was good but i would not call it the best chinese food i have had in the states  having said that the food was still good and maybe lets say one of the best xio long bao that i have ever had (and i have had the din tai fung in california)   we got pork xio long bao   wontons in spicy peanut sauce scallion pancake  chive hot pocket and crispy noodles with shredded chicken  the xio long bao was full of soup and was really good  scallion pancakes were just ok not the best we have had  the chive hot pocket was good and stuffed with a lots of chives but the shredded chicken noodle dish was just meh  the dish of the day was 100 percent the wontons in spicy peanut sauce  the peanut sauce was so good that i wanted to drink it  i poured the remainder of the sauce all over the noodles so that they might get a little flavor  they say that don't expect good service from a chinese restaurant and this place was a good example of why chinese restaurants have that reputation  we had no sauces on our table and we didn't get any with xio long bao  the nice couple on the next table noticed and passed us their bottle of sauce since they were done  when they left the restaurant we had borrow the chili oil and other sauces from that table  also the table was small and there was not enough space yet they didn't bother to remove the empty dishes after we were done with a dish  but other than that food was decent  next time i would like to try some of the breakfast dishes 
absolutely love their soup dumplings  i was spoiled by this place and now whenever i eat soup dumplings from anywhere else  i cant help but compare to these  the wait normally goes by pretty fast depending on what time you go  so the soup dumplings are the best item on the menu but don't let that keep you from trying the other items  i also enjoy their scallion pancakes and some of their other dumplings  overall  i think that this place is definitely worth a try especially if you are in the area and in need of some warm  comforting food 
arived 2pm  wait 20min for a table  3 5 groups ahead of us  clean space  we order sweet soy milk  served in a bow  not too bad  homemade chive dumpling  shanghai shao mai  pork and crab bun  everything is very different since it's shanghai style  it's not dim sum if you   just like me  non chinese expect  the nightlight is salad bar  i order cucumber salad  bean curd with mushroom and bean curd tasty
today  i went there for dinner  with my friends    we love the dumplings  the service was not good  maybe they were busy and they accept cash only   no good
came here from the us open for a quick bite  food was amazing  had the pancakes with beef and scallion and also the dumplings filled with pork and soup 
the crab & pork soup dumplings here are delicious   so much better than most other shanghainese restaurants in the city  i also really liked the iced soy milk  it was refreshing especially since i came here early in the morning right after a red eye flight  there seemed to be a lot of hype with the scallion pancakes  but i wasn't the biggest fan of them  i prefer mine thin and crispy while these were really thick and dough y  but i think it's just my personal preference because my bf really enjoyed them the shanghai pan fried udon was decent  but i didn't think it was anything special  i think next time i'll stick with just getting multiple orders of soup dumplings and i'm interested in trying their fried rice cake dishes!
come early or come late to avoid the crowds  the soup dumplings are good better than joes  has a mix of some dim sum plates too  a decent experience without having to wait hours to be seated 
decent food with surly service the xlb are excellent here and pretty cheap  the beef scallion pancake is also very good (i mean how can beef wrapped in fried goodness with hoisin sauce ever be a bad idea?) skip the shao mai (almost entirely rice) and just get another round of xlb 
i'm typically not a fan of 'chinese' cuisine  but everything we got at this place  i found to be delicious pork soup dumplingscrab soup dumplingsblack fungi   can't remember what else   will definitely be back  and this time introduce some other friends to the place 
i've been several times and i'm still in love with their pork soup dumplings  i think this is the best fresh soup dumplings i've ever had  the beef pancake also hits the spot too  i would 5 5 recommend this place to have a quick breakfast lunch
you're here for the steam dumplings  so don't be shy  try the ones with crab and the ones without and decide for yourself which you like better  don't miss the scallion pancake with beef  it's the best scallion pancake i've ever had 
the food comes out fast and it's delicious! came here for soup dumplings and it's definitely better quality in my opinion (less salty  less oily) compared to the other popular restaurant  we also ordered the fried udon noodles which is now my favorite dish  will return with a bigger appetite! fyi cash only!
i spent all week searching high and low for some soup dumplings  i stumbled upon an article and settled for this place considering i live on long island and did not feel like going into the city  we arrived at dinner time and were seated immediately  upon being seated we were given green tea and our menus  my brother in law ordered the shanghai pan fried u don and i ordered the scallion pancake  both extremely delicious and we knew we were off to a great start  we also ordered the regular soup dumplings and the crab dumplings  everything came out in a timely fashion  soup dumplings were filling  delicious  and rich in flavour  my only complaint is that the spoons provided were a tad smaller than the dumpling therefore it was easy to accidentally poke it and have the soup pour out  other than that  and the fact that the servers weren't the most attentive  everything was great  can't wait to come back to have some more xiao long bao and try the other dishes this place has to offer  *as others have mentioned the place is cash only and kind of easy to miss 
nan  xiang  xiao  long  bao  review is over  lol jkthis is the best soup dumpling place around   in new york  for those that disagree  go get your taste buds checked at the taste bud doctor  this place is not overrated  this place is not to start  this place is located in the heart of flushing  a little annoying to get to  and usually there's a wait  but good things come to those who wait  the service here can be a bit 'rigid' or 'cold' but i think that's just due to the culture barrier language barrier of the restaurant  don't get too taken aback by it  the go to is the pork soup dumplings  i personally don't like the crab meat  i don't really like the yellow color or taste  the cucumbers are good here  the scallion pancake (though oily  doughy and not worth it)  the noodles always look really god  the reason why the soup dumplings are so good is because a) the dough they use for the bao is solid  not too doughy  not too light  just the right amount b) it's fresh and doesn't have any weird tastes in the pork   soup c) the bao doens't just break when you pop it moreover  if you want soup dumplings  come here  just stop reading this review  and google maps  apple maps  waze  uber  lyft  tinder  juno  whatever this place here and eat this soup dumpling  then let me know how right i am )
really great authentic food! i ate the scallion pancake with the vegetable dumplings and it all came up to $10  they serve you hot tea once you get there so it's not an additional cost  problem i would have to say is the space and that it only accepts cash  great experience !
i'm really disappointed  the soup dumplings taste so different from what they used to taste like  it's a bland off balance mixture of meat and ginger that does not taste inspired  the service is good because they don't bother you but    a few times we were there  they ran out of cups (????)   so strange  anyways  they do care that you're satisfied though  one time  we had a cucumber garlic dish that did not at all taste fresh  and they gave us a new one right away hope this downhill trend reverses soon!!! also  a tip for those who are coming here for the first time  you have to go to the hostess to get a ticket number! otherwise  you'll get skipped by all the regulars 
so i've been to this place a couple of times & last night i went dinner with my brother & co yelper kathy & sierra after the yelp event  when we got there we got seated fast  me & sierra got the crab meat soup dumplings & i got the siomai  kathy got the beef pancake scallions  as always its delicious!!! you enjoyed every bite & its cheap  for drinks i got the cold soy milk & its refreshing! service is fast  i paid around $13 for my food with tips on it already  i love this place!
there was a wait  but good things come to those that wait in this case got the crab and pork xiao long bao  pork xiao long bao  pan fried udon  crispy dough and hot sweet soy milk  everything came out at once and little talking ensued the crab bao was not as salty as the pork  would have gotten another tray if we weren't so full  highly recommended 
xlb for the win!! omg  these were the best pork soup dumplings i've ever had  yes  better than din tai fung  better than joe's shanghai  i was completely and utterly in love after my first bite into that succulent  juicy  extremely flavorful dumpling the so and i came later in the afternoon so we didn't have much of a wait  in addition to the dumplings we also ordered the scallion beef pancake ( a bit too oily for me  very crunchy)  the garlic cold cucumbers ( super refreshing)  the braised beef noodles ( so tender and amazing broth) and two orders of soy milk  the entire meal came out to be approx 30 and we were stuffed   service was in point too! i would just say try to avoid the busy hours and go with cash  definitely try out the soy milk and the cold appetizers 
love the soup dumplings  try the fried ones too
yesterday i ate something with my family in this restaurant  it tasted really good  my family also liked it very much  thank you  we will come again next time  highly recommended! !
great dim sum at the best prices! i love the spicy peanut dumpling and of course the soup buns  service is courteous to friendly depending on who helps you  but never bad  we're regulars here! definitely no frills but one can understand the michelin star  it's all incredibly fresh and leaves you satisfied and not weighed down with potential additives  highly recommend!
food  soup dumplings and scallion pancakes were perfect ambiance  super casualservice  sucks but fastdrinks  had basic hot tea
i think it's really a 3 5 stars kind of place  food is decent for the most part  but didn't really blow me away with anything  i ordered salty soy milk  beef pancake  red bean puff  turnip buff  fried dough  and of course steam dumplings  out of everything the red bean puff was my favorite  flaky pastry with the right amount of bean paste  steam dumplings were okay  not the best i've had  the dumpling skin is a little bit thick in my opinion  but flavor was alright  i didn't want to order the beef pancake initially  but then saw almost everyone there ordered it and there are so many pics on yelp on this dish  so i tried it  it was a bit greasy  but the pancake was crispy  i think this is a well received dish among more americanized pallet  i still prefer mine the old fashion style  with just scallion!  poverall not a bad spot for some shanghainese style dim sum  but i would not wait on line for a spot and definitely not a must try kind of spot in my book 
reliable and delicious and cheap  i hadn't been here in ages  so when a friend visiting from china for an extended period told me she was craving chinese food  i took her here  we ordered the crab roe soup dumplings  spicy beef noodles  beef & tripe appetizer (my personal fave and a must order whenever i eat chinese sichuan)  cold tofu slice appetizer  and a beef pancake thing  if this sounds like a ton of food for two people  well  it was  but in our defense a few of the foods were just appetizers  ) every dish was excellent   the beef & tripe was my favorite but it might just be because i love the dish  soup dumplings were spot on  although ours didn't come with the lettuce underneath so we had a few casualties (i e  leaked soup)  the beef pancake thing was recommended by the waitress and was basically a beef sandwich inside a scallion pancake   so good  go here  and order everything 
great place and delicious food  will be back next time i am hungry in this area  the service is great and friendly
came here again on june 2017   same experience as before  food was incredible and cheap  but service was horrible  as waiters only cared that you vacate your table as quickly as possible  and they are not very attentive of what you want  you have to keep on reminding them of your order or your water or tea 
dropped by late night on valentine's day  we were seated quickly and given our tea  the table has the ginger and vinegar for the soup dumplings (xiao long bao) by default  so it seems to be assumed that you'll be ordering them  i did order them  very good soup dumplings  they were very hot  the soup within was flavorful  and the skins did not break when lifting them  also picked up the scallion pancakes  fried pork buns  and a bowl of braised beef noodle soup  scallion pancakes were especially crispy  and the fried pork buns were cooked perfectly  the braised beef noodle soup had good beef  but was mediocre at best  at a place with dumpling house in it's name  make sure to stick to their dumplings buns 
easily packed and for good reason  the food is relatively cheap for what it is  it's authentic as can be and reminds me of simpler times  so i'm slightly biased here  it's walkable from the 7 train and you'll even see a lot of foodies venturing out to try this place 
i went with a couple of fellow yelpers after a yelp elite event  in the event  they only feed us some yummy dessert  so we all were in a mood for dumplings  there was not wait in the restaurant with is great always  we all share some orders; scallion pancake with sliced beef  steamed crab meat & pork buns  pan fried pork dumplings and some jelly fish scallion pancake  the scallion pancake was very crispy and was  wrapped around the sliced beef and that delicious sauce  a good option while is warm(don't taste if is cold)  i will say that the taste was perfect  steamed crab meat & pork buns  this is not my first time having this plate  i remember that the first time i burn my tongue eating this  so this time i was prepared to eat it  it had a good amount of meat inside  a flavorful broth  and a tasty dumpling wrapper that held up to the transfer from the steamer to my spoon  i just add a little touch of sauce to give it an extra taste  pan fried pork dumplings  the dumpling was very juicy on the inside and crispy seared outside! great taste  i also try the rice cake  i wish to order this plate; the rice cakes were very addictive  the server was good and the food was excellent 
we had xiao long bao  shanghai noodle  jellyfish  seaweed and a few other cold dishes  very authentic and reasonable price!
the xlb here are really solid  the skin is pretty thin and the soup inside is flavorful  plus you can actually taste the crab which is kind of a rarity  unfortunately things go downhill from the xlb  the beef scallion pancake roll is just ok  the pancake is a bit too greasy and would be better if it was thinner and there was more beef  the shui jian bao are pretty mediocre with a bad meat to bun ratio (too much bun) but on the plus side  you only really have to get xlb anyways so just get like 1 2 orders per person and you'll have a great time 
for two people who were rather hungry  it was a half hour wait after a 20 minute estimated seating time  fortunately  the weather made it comfortable to wait outside we ordered (after quite a wait for a server to take our order) two orders of steamed pork buns  the scallion pancake and the crispy noodles with beef  we ended up full and satisfied with our choices from their surprisingly limited menu  we actually could've done one less item and still been full  each of the dishes was good  none amazing   i prefer soup dumplings elsewhere and the lack of options elsewhere on the menu caused us to double up on the dumplings the service was very slow to bring the check and change  but surprisingly efficient with refilling water and tea   glad i checked it out  but probably not returning 
good selection  great tasty food  youtiao was a little tough and oily  shalongbao was soupy n moist  skin was medium  overall good
while the scallion pancakes  garlic cucumbers  and noodles are excellent  the service was sub par   waitresses never came back  difficult to get a glass of water or a new utensil   and the other dishes we had were mediocre to less like the scallion pancake with beef (the reason i went i the first place) and mustard green rice cake 
love both kinds of their xiao long bao! they are the juiciest xiao long bao i've ever had  nice job  the drunken chicken is not that good  the shumai was ok but very authentic 
cash only  we ordered 4 dishes totaling to $27 (before tip)  they serve you free tea which is great for this nyc weather  there was not many people when we ate  so service was attentive  and fast  we really enjoyed their food 
the wait around 2pm was only like a minute  since they have ample seating in the adjacent room  however  you can tell they really try to utilize their space so you may end up with a very small table with cramped seating  beef scallion pancake & scallion pancake were both super crispy and delicious  however i liked the regular pancake over the beef pancake because of the sweet brown sauce they put in the beef one  i'm more of a savory food person rather than a sweet food person  and the sauce was a little too sweet for me personally  i also tried the shanghai udon noodles  which were pretty good  but its a little too oily for my liking  the pork soup dumplings had a really taste and hot soup broth  however  i didn't leave thinking the dumplings were amazing  to me  it was just average  but not super good for the prices  this place is cheap  but service is ehh  i had to wait a while for cold water and the check 
food was superb! there's so many places to choose from in the area but glad we went here  there is a reason why it's 4 plus stars  can't wait to go back 
one of the best place to get your carb fix in  everything from their shanghai soup dumplings to beef roll to pancakes to soup noodles to rice cakes to the cold dishes to the regular dumplings are so good  i came here for breakfast and lunch before and it never disappoints  this place has expanded a few years ago after their neighbor restaurant closed down so now they have more tables and the wait is not as crazy long  during prime hour  expect a wait i usually order the shanghai soup dumplings  an order of their pan fried dumpling  beef roll  rice cake and a few cold dishes  yes  full of carbs! they are all freshly made and is meant to eat right away  meaning if you let it sit at your table  it won't be as good!don't expect great service  but this restaurant is priced reasonably and has a great selection of shanghai and taiwanese cuisine  they serve free tea as well 
small store front with plentiful seating  came on a weekday morning  so line at all haha best xiao long bao place i've been to by far  lots of soup with lots of love inside  they are freshly made so you may have to wait  we started out with the garlic cucumber  sweet  crunchy  super refreshing 10 10 would recommend you can't expect stellar customer service from a restaurant from chinatown  this is your classic chinese brunch place  they do the job and done  there's a language barrier so read the reviews on here instead of asking them for recommendations!!!i don't really have to mention parking since this is new york!!
came here several times to see what the hype was really about  the food was only okay  the soup dumplings that they are famous for are just mediocre  i've definitely had better soup dumplings else where in flushing  the service was lacking all the times that i went  the servers were rushing and not attentive  i guess its suppose to be a sit  eat  and out place  there are better places for soup dumplings in flushing  will not be coming back!
they have all the reviews and customer they need service is poorfood is ok price is a bit much for flushing
something different  good reviews on the soup dumplings so gave it a try but they only have pork soup dumpling  wish they had other option  but overall the experience was good
ok so the service here sucks! they just left us hanging for quite a bit  even people around us were also complaining  i know it probably gets hectic and crazy but the waitresses waiters should really pay attention to the customers  anyways  i ordered the spicy beef noodle soup  my boyfriend ordered the seafood crispy noodles  we then ordered the crab meat and pork soup dumplings or steamed whichever you prefer to call it  neither of us liked our noodles we ordered because there was no flavor whatsoever but we did enjoy the soup dumplings  the only reason why i'm giving this place 3 stars  i'm from philadelphia and i'm so use to having my soup dumplings with hot oil also  so i was bummed out that they didn't have it  still good alone with vinegar  i like to drown mine overall  soup dumplings are awesome but the service isn't
always great food  my fav comfort food place  my only issue is the long wait  soup dumpling with crab is my favorite  shanghai noodle is great too!
i like the food  just like in china my mom make some tst  i will come back again  service was good too
came here with the bf on a monday night and surprisingly the place still got packed by 9pm anyway lol  we went ahead and ordered the crab&pork soup dumplings as well as the pork soup dumplings since we saw that this place was popular for it and boy we're the right! loooved them! had the perfect amount of savory flavor and they all held a lot of soup  me and my boyfriend are big on the hot oil and chili so it was even better adding it to the soup dumplings  highly recommend it  we also got beef noodle soup & pan fried pork dumplings which were just as good! i'm definitely coming back here  just the location wasn't too great since it's in such a crowded area  it took us almost an hour to find good parking 
so i came here one night with a couple friends to see what this is about   i think the reason why this place is getting such good rating because it's cheap!!!! when i saw the bill i was like "omg"! the food was really not that great   too oily   the soup dumplings were really good! come here for that! we ordered scallion pancake  pork and veg rice cake  and other stuff (forgot) and they were super oily and the cashier was yelling at some staffs which i didn't like   i really hate it when i see the staff are not treating other staff with respect   such a turn off 
went there around 6pm and the wait was about 15 mins for two  which isn't bad considering that the juicy buns there are amazing! they're made fresh and you can definitely taste it  best juicy buns in flushing ! if you want juicy buns this is the place to go! just make sure you bring cash  cards are not accepted 
4 5 stars rounded down it's a bit of a trek  but this authentic little gem was worth the hour subway ride  their menu is pretty small and from the pictures on yelp  the same 4 5 dishes are ordered repeatedly  crab soup dumpling  pork soup dumpling  shanghai shumai  shanghai noodles  and beef rolls in green onion pancake  in my opinion  only the soup dumplings and the shumai are the only dishes that makes this place special  i recommend getting a couple orders of each and then eat to your heart's content  the cheap priced doesn't hurt either  i usually expect subpar service at any really authentic chinese restaurant  they're usually borderline rude and only have one facial expression  however  believe it or not  the service here was surprisingly pleasant  it could have been a one time thing  but either way it won't stop new yorkers  or helpers from coming 
delicious cheap eats in flushing (cash only)! you can spot this place from afar from the long lines  so it is highly recommended to go a little before "peak hours"   i actually don't come here for the soup dumplings however they are quite good here   much better than joe shanghai for sure!  if you are a first timer to this establishment then yes get the soup dumplings  don't expect much regarding decor   it's flushing its very bare minimal what i come here for and recommend;   rice cakes with shredded pork and mustard plant (so good!)   scallion pancake with sliced beef  beef and chilli pepper noodle soup   beef noodle soup
i used to like this place a lot because of their side dishes  very tasty and fresh  today i decided to go for breakfast since i haven't been there for a long time  how disappointed!!! first my side dish (cucumber) wasn't fresh at all! tasted like it was made from the day before  and the most disappointing thing was from where i was sitting    i saw waiters putting foods into the microwave to heat them up  dish after dish of food was being heat up before serving  we ordered a salted bean curd鹹豆花  it was also being heated up in the microwave 
having a bit of time before a yelp elite event (snowdays a few doors down   highly recommend for dessert after) i decide to finally try this place on my own to see what all the hype is about  i enter the cash only establishment early on a monday (5pm) to find many tables open and surprised at how large the space is   three attached rooms of tables  the hostess asks how many i say just myself she directs me to the room next door  i am given tea and a menu which has two sides   pictures of items on one side are very helpful the service is very friendly and i go with the ever popular pork and crab soup dumplings  shortly thereafter another server brings a small dish of julienned ginger and tells me that black vinegar is on the table  i didn't realize at the time that most people make a dipping sauce of ginger and the vinegar to compliment the flavor of the dumplings  silly me  i ate pieces of ginger like a palette cleanser   haha  my bad! i must say this was some strong  flavorful ginger pieces   i liked that  i did try the vinegar by drizzling a bit on the dumplings so i got the affect after all another popular dish is the scallion pancake with beef so after i finish my dumplings i get an order of this  i liked them very much   quite flavorful with hoisin sauce added to the beef to add some sweetness to the dish  great flavor  but i could only finish one of the three pieces nan xiang is a great choice and is open pretty late on weekends (1am) so it is good to go with a group to order a few different items and share  the decor is very basic so it is all very casual  i can see the appeal of why so many love the top notch food in the low key surroundings  my kind of place!
the cashier is ugly   the waiter is lazy as hell!food is not that great  too oily   i don't they deserve 4 stars reviews  so i have them 2 
authentic shanghainese food! the portion of the cold dish were little too large  good for sharing  love the soybean milk
i was really disappointed with this place when i first came here a few years ago  my friend insisted on having lunch here so i thought i should give them another chance  i was once disappointed again  even more than the first time  just as a two star rating would say  "meh  i've experienced better " exactly how i felt  i'm sorry for not understanding the wow factor of this place but the quality of the food had disappointed me more than once  i live 1 5 hours away from here  i will not travel all the way here again  just to be disappointed  the scallion pancake with beef was not flakey and crisp enough  the beef was too lean and not tender at all  the beef pancake was cut in three pieces  only the middle piece had a decent amount of beef  did someone eat the beef from my scallion pancakes? because i couldn't find them in there  i tried both soup dumplings  the pork ones were not juicy enough and the skin was way too thick  it's hard to explain in details  but i just did not like how they make their dumplings here  the crab soup dumplings did not have enough crab flavor  the ground meat in both dumplings were too lean and the stock was not rich enough  and i always prefer lettuce over paper  i was excited for the spicy beef & tripe "husband and wife slices"  it was decent but i can't seem to really enjoy it after having bad soup dumplings  there were too many beef shank slices in mine and i'd prefer more tripe or at least an equal amount  i paired the spicy beef tripe with a sweet soy milk and garlic cucumber  this was my only part of the meal that i enjoyed  i do not recommend the crispy noodles  the noodles itself was alright but the sauce on top was too salty  in a weird way  i usually love salty food so if someone that likes salty finds it salty  that's really something  it was very unappetizing to me  i was craving for the wine chicken  they didn't offer the wine chicken during lunch hours but they would have it on their menu  okay  the service was not consistent  had to ask them to refill my tea while they just stood there on their cellphones  the place was not crowded at all  it was either that  or they just stood there watching us eat  making us feel uncomfortable  i went to the food court to get more food afterwards because the meal wasn't satisfying 
new york's chinatowns are changing right before your eyes  but thankfully cantonese home cooking still exists in flushing!!the fried pork dumplings are perfection; the pork chop noodle soup is heartwarming comfort food  the scallion pancakes and assorted bao are delicious  everything is prepared from scratch  in house; no surprises   just great food for a great price  i love this place!
i've seen this restaurant on yelp really often when i was searching for places to eat in flushing but i never tried it out  one day my boyfriend and i finally decide to try it  when we walked in  the hostess asked us how many people right away  we got seated rather quickly  however since there was a lot of people and we were just two people we got stuck at a tiny table squished between some other people  we ordered the beef scallion pancakes  2 orders of soup dumplings and the shanghai udon noodles  i really enjoyed all of the food and so did my boyfriend  the beef scallion pancakes were cooked perfectly  it was soft on the inside but had that flaky crunch i like about scallion pancakes  the soup dumplings were great as well and i loved the sauce they cooked the shanghai noodles with  it was a simple but savory dish  overall  the food was amazing and the price was low  although it was crowded and loud  it's a given since they have such good food at a low price  i will definitely be coming back and recommend this to anyone that was authentic chinese food!
lives in nearby hotel and came here to try the food after reading the good reviews  food  soy milk was rich and warm reminding me the childhood memories  油条very disappointing because it did not taste like fresh made and seemed a day old which is surprising since i went in at 0800 am  soup dumplings were really good  will be back to try other things 
came here today (saturday) with two friends around lunch time and this place was packed!  they have a regulated queue system though so everything went smoothly   we waited about 20 minutes only and got seated   we ordered the steamed crab meat & pork buns  steamed pork bun  soy milk  shanghai pan fried u don and pork wontons in spicy peanut sauce   steamed crab meat & pork buns   my favorite dish!  the crab meat was super tasty and the soup base was bomb!steamed pork bun   love this regular favorite as well  soy milk   i love how they give this to you in a to go cup!  the soy milk was so sweet and authentic   one of the best i've ever had!shanghai pan fried u don   this was delicious!  it didn't feel heavy at all   although i wished they gave more veggies!pork wontons in spicy peanut sauce   did not like this dish!  it was super bland and i did not feel the heat at all  this place is fairly inexpensive   our meal came out to be less than $32 00   their service was prompt although the soup dumplings took really long to come out but that's because they steam them fresh!  i will definitely come back if i'm around flushing!
food  4 0 5 0service  2 0 5 0value  3 0 5 0decor  2 5 5 0overall  3 5 5 0 nan xiang probably has the best soup dumplings in the city   unfortunately  the service is fairly terrible  and the cost of tasty xlb is a long wait (think up to 30 minutes on a weekend mid afternoon for a restaurant in flushing)   the rest of the menu is fairly basic   i would recommend ordering a few apps just to pass the time because they do get backed up on the xlbs which may end up taking 20 30 minutes to come out 
ambiance  bright  open  somewhat clean  it definitely has its authentic asian touches  location  this is located in the heart of chinatown  so you know its authentic  easy to find  street parking service  quick service  not the friendliest bunch  but that is expected  especially when everyone else is speaking their native tongue and you don't food  all dumplings were delicious  i tried fried  steamed  with all different proteins in the middle  there is definitely a perfect little dumpling here for each and every person  i tried beef  pork  chicken  all were delicious  i also tried their scallion pancake and was mildly impressed  it was very oily  i understand it is fried  but most places will try to soak the oil out before bringing it out  also  it was not nearly as crispy enough and slightly too thick  stick with the dumplings when you get here  i also saw other customers slopping down soup  looked good  i will try it the next time i come back pricing  reasonable prices for dumplings  $5 7 dish with 5 8 dumplings each 
this place is over rated by the people  the food was okay  the crab meat dumpling is good and juicy  but the service is very bad and the waiter is rude and doesn't care about you since they are busy for their business and totally ignore your request  even refill a glass of water or ask for a spoon  dine in on a saturday night and left very angry 
been here a couple of times and it hasn't disappointed me yet  cash only place but that's fine! definitely an affordable place to eat at if you don't want to spend too much for a brunch with a friend  came here on a sunday afternoon and had to wait roughly 15 minutes for a seat  no big deal  had the soup dumplings that everyone was raving about but honestly wasn't my favorite  felt like they just heated it up and served it barely warm  other than that  the stir fried udon with beef dish was pretty good 
came here for the soup dumplings! ordered both the the crab and pork  pork was much more flavorful than the crab but both pretty good  the dim sum here is limited  in addition to soup dumplings  we ordered the pan fried noodles  wontons in spicy peanut sauce  scallion pancake w beef  rice cakes w pork  and fried dumplings  everything tasted soo good  my favorite being the scallion pancakes  i'd come back just for that! over all food and service were excellent  wait time was bearable  just fyi there's no sign in english so just look for a crowd of ppl waiting outside 
grew up eating xiao long bao at joe's shanghai   but i knew i needed to eventually venture over here to try theirs so i did! this place is more casual and is definitely more westerner friendly than some other restaurants in flushing  the best selling items have photos on one side of the menu  with the other side of the menu listing every item by genre tried the pork & crab xlb  seafood crispy noodles  stir fry udon noodles and scallion pancake  the scallion pancake was really good  flaky and crispy fresh all at the same time  the xlb was juicy but some of the skin stuck to the cabbage (guess i gotta be extra careful next time)  it tasted really good like aligned with din tai fung   but i still have to stay loyal to my og xlb experience at joe's! i preferred the seafood crispy noodles  they came with a whitefish and shrimp which surprised me because i'm used to seeing some squid or shellfish in my crispy noodles at other places  overall tasty and enjoyable but i did feel very thirsty for the rest of the night prices are cheap and food is great to share with friends or family  not sure i would come back since there's a lot of other places i love in flushing but the xlb are pretty good and it's a quick casual spot to grab a meal!
the quality of the food here has definitely gone down throughout the years  now that so many other xlb places have work opened up  there's no need to come here if i'm craving for xlb if you're coming here for dinner  especially on a weekend  you'll have to wait for a while because its popular restaurant the food has gotten really really oily (like the rice cakes or the noodles)  i feel like every time i leave the restaurant  my stomach hurts a bit because of all the oil  the scallion pancakes are still really delicious and crunchy so i definitely recommend getting that 
don't know how i forgot to review this place    so to get this out of the way  service here is bad  maybe even worse than the average chinatown restaurant  ditto with cleanliness    i mean if the health department cared they could probably shut this place down anytime they felt like it  ok so maybe i exaggerate a bit  but you've been warned none the less but the xiao long bao here are arguably the best we've had (and we've had a lot)  they are consistently well made and juicy and wonderful and everything you want in a soup dumpling  this place hits the spot 9 times out of 10 which ain't bad for chinatown many of there other dishes are also good  but you go for the xiao long bao and you'll be happy 
cash only  me and my friend were waiting outside like 25 mins  finally we got seat   we order 2 nan xiang xiao long bao  but only comes one  we ask one of waitress and she said we have to wait other 15mins because they forget order  everything tasted good over there  the service was not very good 
one of the better places to get soup dumplings i've eaten here for both takeout and dine in  both times  i think i came during off hours  because there wasn't really much of a wait for a table or takeout i definately think that dining in is better  mostly because the sauces for the dumplings are readily available on the table  it was a bit of a pain to season the dumplings in my takeout container i've tried quite a few dishes here  the pork soup dumplings are where its at  seems like that's their specialty and that's what they're known for  the soup from the dumplings is (temperature) hot  so you have to let it cool down a bit  before you inhale it  you get six of them  the skin is nice and soft and is very tasty  the soup is very tasty as well  i can definately see why this place gets so many good reviews  only knock on this place  are that the soup dumplings are a bit expensive at around $6 if your in flushing and you're a soup dumpling fan  definately give this place a try 
the food is nothing spectacular but it it is good and you'll enjoy yourself for sure  the food is good despite the simple house style way it is presented  the service isn't the best  however  this is a go to place whenever my friends and i need a place to eat or settle down on  always go for the soup dumplings regardless of what else you order 
great pricing  beautiful soup dumplings  scallion pancakes  and other shanghainese cuisine  seating is a bit limited but you can get a table pretty fast 
i love this place  their dumplings are incredible  please eat their dumplings  they will bring you much pleasure and mirth 
really delicious food with a surprising array of vegetarian options (but you have to ask for them)  i loved the cold bean curd dish  the rice cake dish was also amazing  i'd seriously consider making a trip out here just for this food  the atmosphere felt a bit like a food court and the wait staff was hard to flag down  but the food made it all worth while 
nan xiang's soup dumplings are one of the best in nyc but to be honest  sometimes just isn't enough to make up for some of its weaknesses both the crab pork and the pork soup dumplings are delicious but a bit pricier than most places in flushing at 6 75 and 5 75 respectively  if you like soup dumplings but want a little more crunch  it's also worth trying the pan fried pork dumplings that are basically a xiao long bao with a thicker  firmer pan fried skin but similar soupy filling  my old favorite was the hand made steamed dumplings but every time i've gone  "the chef isn't here"  the other dishes on the menu  like soy milk and noodles  do not particularly stand out and are sometimes disappointing since nan xiang has gotten more recognition  it's been much more user friendly to non chinese customers with things like an english and pictorial menu to help with ordering and more english speaking staff  however  service and ambiance is still very utilitarian as expected in some old school establishments in flushing and new crowds of tourists take a bit away from the experience all in all  i would still come to nan xiang for a quick dumpling fix by myself or with a few friends  but definitely would not expect this to be a place to really hunker down and catch up or to impress parents from out of town 
bad customer service   i called the restaurant and placed my order at 9am and i got to restaurant to pick up food at 9 10am and they apparently messed up my order with a different noodle   they could have told me they made my order already but it's a different type of noodle and it works fine with me too   but they didn't and redo my dish so i waited 20 more minutes for my order   no apology from the lady who messed up my order 
this is probably one of my favorite and most recommended restaurants to go to! if you're looking for one of the best if not the best soup dumplings in nyc  this is it!1) the food is consistently delicious  soup dumplings are incredible  i loved their turnip puffs and the scallion pancakes aren't nearly as oily as most chinese restaurants while maintaining great flavor 2) the service here is great! i didn't have to wait very long to put in my order and have it served onto the table  personally  i hate it when a waiter waitress constantly hovers over customers to check in on their needs  this place has it just right  3) the price point is as best as it gets! i've ordered shanghai udon  two orders of soup dumplings  pan fried pork buns  turnip puffs  scallion pancakes and a chicken soup   for what you're getting  quality dishes for under $30 is astounding!the only partial con i would consider is the wait time to get seated in during lunch dinner hours  it will take a while  but imho  it is absolutely worth it!
i still like the soup dumplings and although the place has expanded  there is a wait  albeit 15 minutes on a friday night   there were several large parties before us which probably precluded us from being seated immediately   i guess that's a good thing    in the old days  we would have waited much longer   when i went up to the "hostess" to get a number and asked how long the wait would be  she said 10 minutes and in a slightly brusque manner  retorted  "you want to wait?" and threw me the number when i said yes   nan xiang is still popular and the food is good   we ordered just 3 dishes for the 2 of us  beef noodles  seafood with crispy noodles and the obligatory pork and and crab soup dumplings  all were tasty  prices low but my bf and i both noticed some msg reaction after eating   nothing serious but he had a little headache and numbness on his tongue   i had some sudden body fatigue   we are not certain that our symptoms can be attributed to what we ate and the feelings went away but it was interesting we both had slight reactions   note  also the place does not take credit cards but generally that shouldn't be a problem because you can get away with less than $35 for 3 dishes  tip included   rumors have it or perhaps i read it in a new york times article a while back  that only women make the soup dumplings because they can roll and crimp the dough thinner than men   the men are allocated the kitchen work  stir frying in particular  because they have the upper body strength to lift the heavy woks   true or not  we observed 4 women efficiently hovering over a mass of ground meat  two rolling out the dough and two filling and crimping the dumplings in a tight workspace behind the cashier receptionist   as far as food is concerned  the dumplings are decent and the other shanghainese dishes are okay   don't come for ambiance because there isn't any   it is a typical chinese dumpling and noodle joint  small tables closely placed next to each other so you're listening to your neighbors' conversations and borrowing each others' condiments   knowing chinese helps but is not required  the menu is not extensive and you pretty much build your meal around the dumplings   the convenience of a municipal parking lot across the street is the another reason i will probably come back if i am in the mood for dumplings and in queens 
literally my favourite breakfast place at the moment  i crave eating here at almost any time of the day! a very straight forward menu and their food is freshly steamed to order  their xiao long bao is the best one i've had so far outside of china  the skin is perfectly steamed and chewy with the inside still remaining full of soup and bits of meat  it's also piping hot which i love!!! they also use actual crab in their crab xlb  because i found a piece of the cartilage in one of my dumplings  lol  the ginger vinegar that comes with the xlb is sooooo heavenly when combined  literal explosion of flavour in your mouth  cold soymilk is super good and especially good with breakfast!!! soymilk seriously completed the whole meal  it goes so well with everything and just made everything extra enjoyable  shanghai shao mai was also pretty good  can't really go wrong with steamed sticky rice in a chewy dough wrap  prices are really cheap and food is authentic and super yummy! this place is a must visit if you're ever in the area! breakfast here is such a dream  i can't wait to visit here again!!!
their dumplings are so good  but service is terrible  the pork buns (soup dumplings) taste exactly how they are supposed to taste  extremely flavorful and juicy  they taste so good when eat fresh  service is horrible here  their waiters are not attentive  they simply don't have a solid serving system  nobody knows what's going on when it is busy  one would think these types of businesses know what they are doing and are equipped to respond to busy days  no!!! they are horrible  their isn't a designated server for each section  no one is responsible for anything  so no one ends up doing anything  the cashier (i believe the owner) was on her cell phone talking for a good 20 minutes while taking to go order and bringing customer's up  terrible service 
cash only! ordered their soup dumplings  beef pancakes  and savory sticky rice roll  the service was quick  atmosphere was clean and quiet on a thursday morning  and the food was super on point!
came on a saturday night around 6pm  about 20 minute wait for 3 people this is for just the soup dumplings  they were the best i've ever had  not much more to say    we didn't really explore the rest of the menu and from what i've heard its pretty mediocre bad lol  but the dumplings  wow 
met all posted expectations food was excellent  from calif  used yelp the local foodies did not steer us wrong!!
i ate in here once and gotten takeout about 4 5 times in the morning  i do like the fact that they open at 8 am  i've tried their crabmeat soup dumplings  pork soup dumpings  scallion pancake with sliced beef  pan fried pork buns  and their rice cake w shredded pork  my son loves their pork soup dumplings and eats two orders by himself in one sitting  i  on the other hand  isn't a big fan of their soup dumplings but i do think the pork one tastes better than the crabmeat  in terms of flavor and the thinness of the skin  i still think kung fu xlb is slightly better  their food aren't always consistent  i ordered the scallion pancake with sliced beef twice for takeout; the first time it had 4 pieces and tasted pretty good and the second time  it had 3 pieces the beef was hard and chewy w no taste  same with the rice cake it's good the first time but not the second  i didn't like their pan fried pork buns; it was way too doughy and didn't have enough filling  i asked them to pan fry the buns for longer bc i wanted them crunchier and of course  they didn't fulfill my request  don't expect excellent service from here  they don't care   
we ended up here for my birthday last night because joe shanghai was closed and i had to have my pork and pickled cabbage noodle soup and dumplings  this place showed up on yelp so we decided to walk a few blocks and try it out  there were 4 of us and we all agree that this place has taken over as our new go to spot! first off  they are open late which is a huge plus  we were promptly seated and given menus and tea  we ordered the shanghai pan noodles  pork and pickled cabbage noodle soup  pork soup dumplings  scallion pancakes  scallion pancakes with beef and the fried pork dumplings  the only thing i wasn't too crazy about was the scallion pancake with beef  otherwise everyone else enjoyed them and i thought the regular scallion pancake was so yummy  the soup was very tasty and better than the same one i get at joe's  everyone thought it was really good  the shanghai noodles were gone in less than 5 minutes (and we ordered 2)  the dumplings were a hit  not too heavy and very flavorful  we all pretty much thought this place was outstanding  very clean  nice staff  fast service  great food and prices! we will be making this our new spot!
i'd give it 3 5 stars for solid but not perfect xlb and chinese chive pockets  my goodness  those chinese chives were so fresh and green and plentiful  i regret not taking a bag of them to go  the xlb   fantastic but they lost the edge since the last time i was here  i've been here once a year for a few years now  and this time i enjoyed them a bit less than last year  watch out nan xiang  please keep the quality ultra high like before!the place has a very local feel to it  comfy but not fancy  and arriving right when they opened is good  we got a table immediately but the sit down and the take out lines filled up before we left  food came quickly and hot!
i usually go to this place for the soup dumplings but the last two times our service has been so bad  i went there last night with a few friends and the workers were just horrible  our waitress didn't write our order down and just grunted and left so we were wondering if our order was going to be placed correctly or not  since the soup dumplings take while to make  shouldn't you confirm if the order is correct? we ordered a noodle dish  1 pork and 1 crab basket of soupdumpling for 3 people  our noodles came out first as expected but we sat there and waited so long for our dumplings and noticed everyone around us who placed their orders after us got theirs first  we didn't complain and when ours finally came she only gave us one basket and we asked if our second one was gonna come later or not? i spoke to her very politely in chinese and she decided to yell "one! one! one!" over and over at us in english as i was trying to ask her a simple question to her in mandarin  she could have calmly explained the situation of if it's going to come later or not or just not come at all  she made a huge scene and the whole restaraunt was looking at us wondering what the heck was going on! she just kept yelling one at us untill she finally rolled her eyes and sighed  she didn't apologise and said we have to wait another 20 minutes so we told her we didn't want it anymore which made her even more angry  we didn't want to pick a fight so we let it slide and wanted to get it as fast as possible  our bill was only about 20 bucks and tip would have been $4 but since our service was so horrible  we didnt get what we ordered  we were humiliated   after we were yelled at nobody came to ask us if we needed anything and nobody came to refill our water or tea    everyone was just avoiding us as if we did something wrong even tho we never raised our voices and we didnt complain  so we left and a male waiter that didn't serve us and we didn't even notice comes running out after us  he had the audacity to ask us for more tip! so i calmy explained to him how rude the waitress was and what horrible service we got and explained why we gave that tip  he was nice and apologied and so we brushed it off and said it's fine  it's okay  hope next time things are better  when we were turning to leave he grabbed my arm and asked for more tip      i was so startled but calmly told him i wasn't going to do that because of the bad service and he said " but i said sorry  isn't that good enough? you have to give more tip" we were so shocked at his ignorance and how low he would stoop for another dollar! he wouldn't let us leave! he kept grabbing me while i was trying to turn away and then he got angry at us! he said that tips were his pay and he needed money       well if that was the case shouldn't they be nicer to the customers? so then he got even more mad and started to yell as us and every time i turned to walk away he kept grabbing my arm  he stood there yelling at us untill another waiter came out to ask what was going on and he began to  tattle on us like a child!  we were so baffled at the workers here we didn't want to explain ourselves again or get yelled at by a third worker that we turned and walked away before the guy could grab me again  i've been coming here since i was a child with my family but after this experience i never want to set food in that place ever again  they were so friendly when i was young but as time when on their attitude and service has gotten so bad  even picking up a takeout order is horrible  the large lady sitting at the cash register gives you an attitude when you pick up your take out orders because  interup her afternoon drama shows on her phone    sadly i have to give it 1 star when i should be giving it no stars  i've never been more humiliated in my life 
have been wanting to try out this place since forever and who better to come here with than my bro! we got here at 12 for lunch and were able to snag seats right away  it's a really popular restaurant and there are a lot of diners but it isn't too bad for a weekday lunch  the decor is pretty much your typical flushing fare but it wasn't dirty  which is a plus  service was not bad either  we got  beef scallion pancakes  one of the most highly raved appetizers and i did think it was pretty good  i like how the pancake was very flaky but i would've liked it to be a little bit crispier since it was a little on the greasy side  the beef was very tasty though and the hoisin sauce complimented the beef slice and the pancake very well pork soup dumplings  these are definitely high quality soup dumplings and you can tell because the skin is not too thick  be careful when biting a hole on top to pour the vinegar in because they are freshly made and the soup inside is very hot!pork with crab meat soup dumplings  honestly  i did not taste the difference between these and the regular pork soup dumplings so i would suggest just getting the regular ones and saving yourself a dollar this is the most reviewed restaurant in flushing and it understandably deserves this title  the place is clean  the service is pretty good  and the food is great  definitely give this place a try!
one of the better chinese restaurants around the flushing area! we wanted to try another restaurant  we found this one  and what a wonderful discovery it turned out to be! when we first arrived at nan xiang  we waited about 10 minutes  the wait staff quickly prepared the tables and sat us quickly  we ordered the scallion pancakes  they tasted perfect   like the way they ought to be  we put some spicy condiments on them  it made the pancakes taste even better  for the entree  i ordered the seafood crispy noodle  since i grew up eating this in chinatown  i had high expectations  once i tasted this dish i loved it! we did not need to wait long for our orders  we got refills for our teas  they gave us ginger to put in our teas  when around flushing  stop over this place  convenient to the skyview mall  you can go shopping after you eat at this place  you will not be disappointed 
this is a soup dumplings go to place in flushing area  their pork or crab pork xiao long bao has this authentic taste that can stay in your mouth for a few hours  please have it with vinegar ginger sauce  the skin is thin but strong enough to hold the pork and juice inside  the way you eat it is to bite a small hole on the side of the soup dumplings  pour a tea spoon of vinegar inside  wait for a few seconds to let the heat come out  suck the juice out of it first  and then enjoy the rest of the dumplings anyway you would like  be careful not to bite off the whole thing  the juice inside could burn your tongue! some other dishes to order is spicy wonton in chili sauce  scallion pancake with beef  rice cakes and fried noodles etc  price is very fair  and service is good enough  food is the best part of this restaurant 
one of my favorite of all time  for soup dumplings  everything on the menu is reasonably priced and this is as authentic xiao long bao as it can get  within the recent years the resturant has attracted along of people that are curious to try  eater ny and blog sites have consistently mentioned xiao long bao so there is quiet a wait for tables after work hours and weekends  the restaurant is also cash only so make sure you make a trip to the bank atm before going 
cash onlyyou know the chinese restaurant is good when there's a line forming outside  you know it's a really good chinese restaurant when even white people are waiting outside for it  i would say to definitely get the soup dumplings (pork is good  don't think you need to pay an extra dollar for the crab and pork mix)  i got one order just for myself  my friends and i also got spicy tripe (they only make a limited amount of it in the morning and sell until it sells out  which can happen in a short amount of time) and the scallion beef pancakes and the scallion rice cake dish  all are really good  the amount of beef in the pancakes is very little though so don't think you need to pay extra for it  just get the scallion pancakes  we also got an order of soy milk  and all of it  with tax and tip  came out to be $50 
went inside  got a number  and turned around to go outside to read the reviews taped on the window until our number was called  once we were triumphantly inside  we checked the menu to see if there was anything else we wanted  i had scoured the many previous yelp reviews for the most popular recommendations  so had good idea of what we should get  we got the savory soy milk  youtiao  scallion pancake with sliced beef  pork xlb  and shanghai shao mai  the sauce in the scallion pancake with sliced beef seemed like hoisin sauce  which was a nice surprise  my friend liked the vinegar for our xlb  unfortunately  we waited too long to eat our xlb  so they were a bit cool  and probably not as delicious as when they first arrived at our table  what i thought was a reasonable amount of food for two people turned out to be a lot more   i didn't feel hungry for the rest of the day  it was worth it!
noddles are no better than a regular chinese place  came here because new world mall was closed  don't rust yelp review  this place is horrible  also they don't bring you water unless you ask several times 
spicy beef noodle is good but the pepper is very spicy  good place to take a quick meal  it's crowded during lunch time but the price is very reasonable  steam vegetable dumpling is not that good 
so we decided to try this place because my sister wanted soup dumplings  i learned that it is called dim sum  we tried the pork and crab dim sum  it was so flavorful  and the price was great  just be careful coz the filling is super hot  dont go chomping down  i wish the staff would show us how to eat it  we had to spy on others to figure out how to eat it  definitively would come back for more dim sum  not a huge fan of the scallion pancakes  if you are indian they taste like a poori  definitely need something to eat with it  very blah on ita own  the tea was good  dont get the sweetened soy milk 
i came for the xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) and i was not disappointed  for $5 50 you get 6 juicy  soft  flavorful soup dumplings  the dumpling skin is just thick enough to keep all the delicious broth from leaking out when you pick it up with chopsticks  best xiaolongbao i've ever tried!we also ordered sheng jian bao (pan fried pork buns) and scallion pancakes  these were not as memorable as the soup dumplings but they were still tasty  the pork buns could've used more meat in the center but the filling was savory and the bottom was perfectly crispy  the scallion pancakes were a bit too salty and greasy  so i don't think i will be ordering them again our server seemed a bit cold and didn't really check up on us after we placed our order  we had to walk up to the hostess to ask for a check  however  the food was great so i will be coming back for sure 
there are three sections to this restaurant and wait time is about 15 minutes for a table for 2 on saturday night  there isn't a lot of space  so you will be eating elbow to elbow and possibly joining in on your neighbors conversation  the menu is simple with the shanghai staples  my boyfriend and i got two orders of soup dumplings  1 crab pork and 1 pork  flavors are much cleaner than joe's shanghai  it's not too oily either  i saw a lot of others things people were ordering and it looked hella appetizing  easily a quick lunch spot in flushing  staff could be a little more attentive 
nice place to visit in flushing   nice people  would recommend to read reviews  try it your self to experience of the lifetime  i would probably  come sometimes in the future to see if there are even better then now 
so yum! omg  try the dumplings  of course  but also the rice cakes and the seafood noodles 
favorite place for soup dumplings  pan fried noodles  rice cakes with meat and veggies  and scallion pancakes   top notch and cheap!  gets crowded at peak times during weekends though 
wonderful  but not as amazing as you would expect from a  michelin rated restaurant 
pork and crab meat xlb (6)  $7 50 soy peas  cabbage  and shredded bean curd  $4 95 this place is cash only 1) pork and crab meat xlbexcellent!!! it has been a few years since i had these most recently  and i revisited  this place still got it  great and reliable as before crab meat is definitely present  the texture is right  the taste is delicate and subtle yet flavorful  of course it is juicy  and you get a little bowl to let you devour all of the tasty soup  you get julienned ginger in a small bowl to freshen your taste  black vinegar is on each table (a must) 2) soy peas (edamame)  cabbage  and shredded bean curddefinitely recommended  find this under the cold appetizer  mildly salted with a hint of roasted garlic and red chili in sunflower (?) or sesame oil  this dish might taste great mixed with bifun  on top of ramen  or with a steamed bun  tasty and very versatile dish the service is attentive (sunday at around 9pm; staff members make sure you have enough tea and your needs are met) and the dining hall is very clean (as it has been)  the tea could have been barley tea  which is caffein free and has a ton of health benefits  very thoughtful for a late night dinner  a sure bet for a great meal 
food  3 5 service  4came here on friday night and there were plenty of tables (due to the restaurant's extension)  we ordered the original (pork) dumplings  crab dumplings  pork & cabbage noodles  and sweet soy milk   the soup and fillings for both dumplings were okay although i would prefer the original  i don't think the crab dumplings are worth it  as for the pork & cabbage noodles  there were very few pieces of pork  the bowl was literally covered with cabbage pieces   the service was pretty quick and attentive 
my wife and i spent a week in nyc where we literally ate xiao long bao every day  sometimes twice  i'll save you the suspense  these are the best  we didn't try the crab with pork here  but the all pork soup dumplings are as perfect as they can be 
the unorganized service and sour attitude from the staff workers here left a sour taste in my mouth  i'm going to opt for other dumpling shops to go to i came in for a solo dinner  and confusion ensued within minutes of my entering in  when i asked for a table for one  the server didn't guide me to the specific table she wanted me to be at  but pointed her hand to the front corner of the eatery  then went back into the kitchen  that was a problem  since i ended up sitting at a table that was already occupied  a different server started speaking me in chinese  to which i said  "i don't speak chinese " she told me disgruntingly  "someone else is already sitting there!" and directed me to a table in the back of the eatery  i responded by saying that another server told me i could sit in the front area  so she moved me to another table there  this second server had a frown on her face as she asked me what food that i wanted; i told her my order  but tuned into the troublesome vibes i was getting from this place  so as she approached my table with the cold soy milk i had asked for  i told her to cancel my order  that i didn't want to eat there anymore i approached the two staff workers at the front table  repeating that i wanted to cancel my order  neither of them looked like they cared about what was happening as i told one of them  "you really need to make your service better here " to which she dismissingly said  "it's okay!" i answered  "it's not okay"  and walked out 
the sheer volume of rave reviews for this place speak for themselves  but i'll throw another one into the mix  with emphasis on their great vegetarian options  i've been here three or more times at this point  and i'm never short of 100% satisfied with the food  the vegetable dumplings are some of the best i've ever had; they're huge  the filling is flavorful  and their vinegar ginger dipping sauce provides a fusion of flavors that is just on another level  i also can't speak highly enough about the variety (and quality) of their vegetable side dishes  i usually order a lot since they're so cheap  and all are great standouts include  fried bean gluten  basically what is called "seitan" in most vegan restaurants today  the dish comes with some black mushrooms and a thick  flavorful sauce  very filling  edamame  spinach  and tofu  pretty straightforward  but really good  cucumber and garlic  relatively basic and simple dish  but with a ton of added garlic that makes it standout from other iterations of traditional pickled cucumber  so good  chinese black mushrooms  aka "wood ear" mushrooms  these are are also prepared with lots of garlic and offer a super interesting texture that i love  shredded potato and pepper  a bit pickled  with a bit of garlic  maybe some other sauce   this one is also a regular order and never fails to impress in conclusion  everything is amazing and i am always looking forward to my next meal here 
solid place   had not been in the area for ~8 years  looks a lot different  just keep on ordering till you are full   service was good and food comes out fast 
service has gotten worse 2 10   what is consider a good customer service? no refill tea or water  no greeting nor thank you  they seem to care about foreign customers more than the chinese customers  but if you're chinese they will assume you speak chinese! don't even deserve 15% tips  must come for the soup dumplings!! but the size somewhat looks smaller every time i come here! the sauce is now on each individual tables  8 10pork and vegetable noodle soup 7 10  more vegetable than pork! the amount of soup and noodle are not the same amount  wonton with peanut sauce 2 10  do not get! fake wontons  they are more suitable for foreigner who can't tell the difference between real and fake wontons  the portion of the fillings is ridiculous small!
i've had better  but this place does it pretty well  not sure if i'm doing this place injustice because my standards for soup dumplings are pretty high  the soup was pretty good but the skin was thick  we got a pork soup dumplings basket as well as a pork and crab one  and we also got two orders of the beef rolled in scallion pancake (3 pieces on each plate)  the soup dumplings had lots of soup  meat was tender and not dry  quite flavorful too  the beef rolled in scallion pancake was quite chewy but definitely could have done with more meat! meat could have had more flavor too; they dumped a bunch of sauce onto it  price pretty fair  not too expensive  this all came out to be around $25 post tax (could feed 2 3 people for a meal) 
i was immediately put off with the very limited menu    i should have went to the other dimsum joint on yelp i thought   the one with 1300 less reviews what was i thinking?walking into nan xiang was under the guidance of the invisible hand of the lord  the soup dumplings here are nothing short of a religious experience  the broth has a velvet silkiness to it that immediately invalidates all previous prejudice  take my advisement  all other soup dumplings are just charlatans  they exist to confuse   to make you think that any schmuck can put soup inside a noodle and its aaaall good   and its true   they are all good  and i am sure you have had "good" soup dumplings  so have i   from stanton social to southeast asia! but here in flushing queens is the ultimate beacon of hope for the world! the reigning champion of soup dumplings my friends    do yourself a favor  stop whatever it is you are doing at the moment and alter your current trajectory and put your destiny on a collision course for 38 12 prince street  flushing queens  namaste  and bring cash 
amazing xlb; delicious  filling  quick and easy on the wallet  the broth is really good without being too greasy  i also like that there are small sticks of ginger in the soy sauce  which is served with a little spoon that you can use to pour soy sauce into the dumpling  cash only establishment so make sure to bring enough 
had my eye on this place for a while now  nice big restaurant with plenty of seating and cozy booths  great menu options  little bit of everything to choose from  my wife  and i ordered soup  for the entree we went with kung pao chicken  hot and sour soup was delicious! actually  best i ever tasted  cant say the same for chicken and corn  bit too much flavor  just didnt taste right for me  the entree was very good  just enough portion for twoa pple to share  real pieces of chicken breast  and  and vegetables   very delicious  service was very good  we were always taken care of and wait for food wasnt long at all  honestly  great place for for birthday  dining  good food and service  next time want to try the beef ( they were out of those) and chicken with mixed veggies  my only complaint is the tiny rice bowl that comes with the dish  just enough for one person  maybe  its just me? either way still coming back  craving for that  noodls soup already!
although soup dumpling were great the scallion pancakes were not hot and seemed undercooked otherwise it's very good
i've been meaning to try this place for a while but parking is always a hassle  i finally made it in tonight and it was worth the trouble  the soup dumplings weren't the best i've ever had but they were still very good  juicy and a thick enough skin to hold up  we ordered the scallion pancake with beef but they forgot the beef and the plain pancake was good enough that we left it off  it was chewy yet flakey and only slightly greasy  the handmade dumplings were just ok  i could've done without them  definitely glad i made it in  not sure i'd make an excursion to return but would definitely stop in if i'm nearby 
hands down one of my favorite spots for some juicy shanghainese soup dumplings   the restaurant can get pretty busy during lunch and dinner hours  especially during the weekends  but be patient because it will be worth the wait!  apparently  this restaurant used to take up half the area it currently occupies   as i was informed  due to rapidly booming business  it took over a neighboring business' space and became what it is now  a pretty roomy and successful shanghainese restaurant   besides the crabmeat soup dumplings  i am a fan of their soybean milk  which comes in a ginormous bowl if you order it hot   i also love their rice cakes  shanghainese siu mai and cold dishes (spicy beef & tripe  gluten  cucumbers  etc)   don't set your expectations too high with the service  as it is  after all  an asian restaurant   just stop by for some simply made yet delicious food that will leave you craving for more 
nan xiang definitely warrants its popularity  the soup dumplings are their claim to fame  the delectable soup (not overbearingly fatty yet not bland)  the thin wrapping  the delicious meat  they're definitely good  but there are a plethora of other great dishes as well    crispy dough  chives pockets  scallion pancakes (with beef as well)  etc  while service leaves much to be desired  the food deserves praise  waits should be expected as well 
this place has pretty good xlb  way better than the ones at joe's shanghai  the broth tasted clear and light and the skin was thin  i also got the sweet soy milk to go with the xlb  the soy milk was good  beats the ones that u buy in a can  came here on a sunday  around 2 40pm  no wait and was quickly seated  but right around 3 or later  there were a lot of people waiting to get seated 
my go to soup dumpling spot  prepare to wait a bit  there always seems to be a line  dishes you can't go wrong with crab pork soup dumplings scallion pancake with beefshanghai fried udonrice cake with mustard greenssalty soybean soup? not sure what it's called in english (picture below)
i have been to this place at least a hundred times in the past few years   but for some reason never bothered to write a review     this past week i ate here twice and i think it's time first of all   (this may become irrelevant)  but it's great for pokemon go players  the place is next to a whole bunch of poke stops and you just know people are using lure here  it's hard to play and eat  but it is your call and this is completely a harmless tip now on to the place  super quick service and great chinese food  people come here for the soup dumplings (which is great by the way  totally recommend it)   but i much rather a simple soy bean drink along with a sauced noodle for a quick meal  a decently priced meal  with that authentic chinese feel  and a full bellaaay is what i come for ;)p s  i am obsessed with kao fu  but would not recommend the kao fu here (they don't really go shanghai styled on it  so it's not especially flavorful) 
not the best nyc shanghainese cuisine i've had but the xiao long bao was great!  definitely will reorder this if we return   most likely my palette but i (and husband too) did not like the the seaweed dish   we also ordered beef shanghai udon noodles which was tasty but was way too greasy for our liking   out of ignorance  i ordered the shanghai dim sum thinking it would be filled predominantly wit meat but instead found they were filled with rice   our go to xiao long bao and other shanghainese dishes are shanghai cafe deluxe in mott st in manhattan and kung fu xiao long bao on main st in queens 
mehhhh dis was aighttttttt  the service was p jankythey took like 15 minutes to bring menus to me and my friend after seating us so we just sat there w and it was awkwardwe had soup dumplings & fried pork bunswhich were    kinda bland n hard 2 finish n not v memorable mehhhh (｡**｡)
excellent food at excellent prices! my husband and i ordered 4 dishes to share and we were really full by the end! we of course ordered soup dumplings  which we burnt our mouth on as they were so hot ha! so make sure you let them cool before eating them  we also ordered beef scallion pancakes which were amazing  i actually preferred them to the soup dumplings  we also had red bean puffs and steamed dim sum  the service was great  we actually missed our number being called (don't think it was called in english)  but once they realised we missed it they seated us straight away  they were always on top of refills for our tea and the cheque and our change was brought quickly  i most definitely will recommend this place to friends and will be back myself! great value 
my mother wasn't a very good singer  neither was my dad  nor any of my uncles or aunties  so i sometimes wonder how i ended up as a singer  then one day  i saw an old  grainy video of my grandmother singing  oh my goodness! she had the voice of an angel  the whole world stopped and listened whenever my "nan sang " so much so that this restaurant is even named after how beautiful it was when my "nan sang" (nan xiang in chinese)  so now you know what to get  pork soup dumplingswhat else  just do what i said and get the pork soup dumplings  k?what about your nan  she's dead  alright? but she could carry a tune  end of cute story  shut up why are you so angry today  i have a gun permit  so hand over your tampon okay what does that mean  it's a texas joke oh  yeah if a regular guitar is too big for your grandmother  then get her a "nan banjo " if she's broken a bone  she needs a "nan xray " and if she's a sheriff in a small town that still builds gallows for criminals  then you should probably attend a "nan hanging" just to see what a violent bloodthirsty woman your granny is nan xiang is one of the best chinese meals i've ever had  bear in mind the food is a bit oily but i *love* oily food  so  certainly the tastiest and juiciest and hottest dumplings i've ever eaten  now bear in mind  i'm no expert on dumplings and never usually order them  but when the entire yelp community raves about this place for its incredible dumplings  i'm obviously going to stop in and try it  and i totally fell in love with it  the service is lovely  the prices are extremely  surprisingly affordable for such a popular place  so busy  with great decor  there's a mixture of tourists and natives  asian americans and other americans  and a hefty dose of foreigners too my grandma always used to speak in her own language  i called it "nan slang " she also used to use an extension cord to kill people  her form of asphyxiation was known as grandma strangling or "nan strang" for short  i know  it's a little morbid  but like everything i ever wanted on e bay  i never had the final say  there were always morbids at the last minute but this is far from a tourist place  it's a "hole in wall"  you can see the huge jets thundering overhead on their way to laguardia  you can see the hookers in the alleyway peddling their wares  you can taste the scalding deliciousness shooting out from inside the dumpling  okay i lied about the hookers  but don't burn your mouth on the dumpling juice if "p**ntang" is slang for p***y then what is "nan tang"?it reminds me of something else  i can't think what  what else is it that when you bite into it shoots scalding hot salty juice down your throat? which you then hungrily swallow down while rolling your eyes back orgasmically? i can't remember  anyway  these dumplings  are  the  bomb  dot  com  what a silly expression  but i used it  and it's done  we move on crap i just missed a call from my grandma  i didn't even realize my "nan rang "it was part of my queens food tour this past spring  i tried white bear  xi'an (yet again)  lamb noodle soup  kimganae korean  and many more  none of them were better than nan xiang (except maybe xi'an)  everyone who loves dumplings and loves chinese food should come in here and give these cheap  filling  delicious dumplings a try  yummmmmm  i can comfortably say these are the best dumplings i've ever had now i know you like g*ngbangs  but have you ever been to "nan bang"? it allows older ladies to live out their fantasies of having multiple partners at the same time  you'd love it  if you love nans  or if you are a nan who loves boys  or whatever  only in nyc and by the way i never take my own trash out  i have these little kids from across the street come over  and take my trash wherever i want them to  because my trash contains all sorts of illegal stuff such as body parts  i mean broken glass  i mean  well  whatever  drugs maybe  idk  anyway i call the kids my "dumplings " i don't care if that's weird  a man having no hair anywhere on his body is not weird either  according to genesis  and no i don't mean the bible  much better than that  check it out youtube com watch?v=lad6…told ya 
i come here all the time   best soup dumplings ever!!!! this is the place to go to for good food 
just waited 45 min for soup dumplings  checked with the staff 2x about our order  got fed up with the lack of concern and am leaving now  many tables have come and go  but our dumplings are nowhere to be found   edit  another table behind us with a hispanic family also waited extremely long for their xlb and were mad  my bf is dominican  so maybe they're racist against hispanics?i will say that the fried pork buns and beef pancake that came lightning fast were delicious 
service is always pretty snappy and bad  but the beef pancake rolls totally make it worth it and more  make sure your order is understood correctly! ask for a receipt! i made the mistake of not checking  only to come home to a wrong order  the xlb here are okay  but they do package them up pretty nicely so they don't stick to each other  just make sure you get the beef rolls  )
this place is definitely overhyped  i don't understand what is so good about this place  once the waiter took us to our seats  i find a pile of water on my chair  he just looked at it and continue doing what he was doing and i had to wipe the puddle of water on my seat myself  once i sat down my boyfriend pointed out to me that his spoon was dirty with stains of brown marks on it  i looked at my spoon and sure enough  there was a stain  it was pretty disgusting at this point  we ordered our food excitingly hoping it will get better at this point  it didn't  my boyfriend got the pork noodle soup  the whole soup was super oily  the noodles were oily  i don't understand why there were so much oil in a plain noodle soup  i got the shanghai pan fried udon and it was just sparkling in oil  it was drenched in oil everywhere  i ate a few bites and i just couldn't take it anymore  it was super oily and it was hard noodles  it tasted like it was undercooked  when i ask for another pair of spoon my for boyfriend and i  the waiter ignored us  they really should hire better people  i needed napkins and i see the waiter on his phone texting in front of everyone  it was just annoying and unprofessional  knowing that i can get better food and better service for the same price is really disappointing  i had a very unpleasant time at this restaurant and will not be returning 
been here plenty of times  great prices  and plenty of seating  well known place for soup dumplings  what to get  steamed pork buns  steamed crab meat & pork buns  scallion pancake w sliced beef  crispy dough  sweet soy bean milk  gets packed on the weekend but definitely worth the wait 
my friends matt  billy  and steve have been raving about this place for years   i was not disappointed   must try
this place is great   cash only   i had the scallion pancakes  steamed pork buns and crispy noodles with chicken   it was so good   service was fast   i highly recommend it 
pros  the food was amazing  i've had xiao long baos at so many good places in both ny and la and this place ranks at the top  there was so much juice in these baos  not a single one was dry and the flavor was so deep  onion pancake was also a great appetizer  spicy noodle was good too but not a stunner like the xiao long baos  cons  it was so hot inside the restaurant  i felt like i couldn't breath during the entire meal  also with the lack of space you're literally sitting right next to strangers   in the end  would come back just to have the amazing xiao long baos 
as a chinese person i can certify the food's great!10 10 would go with xiao long bao again!(place doesn't accept credit card though)
nan xiang ranks 2nd in my list for the best xiao long baos i've ever tasted  definitely the best i've had in nyc  food  these were the larges xlbs i've seen  i knew when i picked them up it would be sloppy because it looked like there was going to be a lot of soup  definitely the largest and with the most soup i've ever seen  odd they give you a spoon that doesn't fit the whole xlb  things got a bit sloppy  i ordered the regular and the crab xlbs  i preferred the crab one  ordered a shanghai rice cake dish as well  it was decent but nothing special  lightly flavored with minimal protein  service  quick chinese service  staff was pretty on top of things  they were on a constant move  environment  definitely has a cheaper feel to it compare to din tai fung  but nicer than joe's shanghai  price  cheap for the quality and portions  food  5service  4environment  4price  5
this is our go to place after a massage along roosevelt  xiao long bao is always good and just recently tried the scallion pancake with beef and was also superb  we also order the panfried noodles pretty much everytime we go here  boyfriend loves their spicy beef noodle soup 
nan xiang dumpling house is one of my absolute favorite go to places with my friends and family  they have a great environment for groups and many seats to accommodate the many people who come in and eat their delicious asian cuisine  everything is well priced and a person can easily spend $10 $20 and find themselves completely satisfied with a full belly  something unique to nan xiang dumpling house is that they have a station enclosed in glass walls to display how their employees hand make their soup dumplings  if you've never had soup dumplings before  i highly recommend them   especially from nan xiang dumpling house because they have the best quality soup dumplings i've ever tasted in nyc  make sure to bring cash when you go because they do not accept credit cards  and come with an appetite!
best xiao long bao restaurant in queens  and i've been to many soup dumplings houses  steamed dumplings skin is delicate so be careful when you lift it off from the steamer  my typical order of 3 regular (not crab) xlb dumplings    1 fried xlb dumplings    and 1 stir fried beef udon noodle dish for 2 people  we tend to take the noodles home as left overs   i visit 1 a month 
the menu items are palatable  not nearly as high in quality or artistically made as the same menu items as ordered in china or taiwan  but serve as acceptable substitutes for the occasional fix the 牛肉夾蔥油餅 (scallion pancake with sliced beef) and the 南翔小籠包 (nanxiang steamed pork buns) are highly recommended for first time visitors  the scallion pancakes were a bit thick  ~5 mm  so not very crunchy but still chewy  the 小籠包 are not pork "buns"  as the listed on the english menu  but thin skinned xiaolongbao filled with ground pork  chives  and a hot broth  which was more oil than broth (so don't expect to relive your din tai fung fantasies here) the breakfast and cold appetizer items are a refreshing foil to some of the greasier menu items  but i was quite disappointed by the 甜糯米飯糰 (sweet onigiri) from the breakfast menu  as you can see from my photo  the "sweet sticky rice roll" consists of only rice  油條  and  white sugar  not brown sugar  not ground peanuts  not black sesame paste  not soy sauce  all purpose white sugar  no vegetables  no meat  no 肉鬆  no eggs  i regret ordering this because i could have made it at home  minus the 油條  saving myself the $2 95 i paid for just warm white rice  fried dough  and sugar packets from the coffee shop down the street table service was acceptable  wait staff were attentive in refilling tea this establishment falls short of a four star rating because one grungy co ed restroom is not nearly adequate to service an entire restaurant of 80+ customers and staff  cash only  no reservations accepted  so fcfs for groups 
the soup dumplings were pretty good  we had both the pork dumpling and the crab   pork dumpling  i liked the pork dumpling better  the stir fry udon and rice cake noodles were both tasty  i wish it was not as oily though  it was not busy when we were there but for some reason the waitress was anxious to clear some plates  the udon dish was not done and she was rushing us to empty the plate so she can take it away 
after waiting 15 mins to order our food  other table that was seated after us even got their food! we first received our chicken in white wine sauce and cucumber  then she came by to ask if we are ready for the check  even though our main course soup dumplings and dry pepper & beef noodles haven't arrived yet  she looked very confused  asked what else did we order! finally all our food came!!!after paying for our delicious meal in cash! i was looking through my wallet  started taking out dollar bills  at that moment  she passed by glanced over and stopped at our table to remind us that minimum tip rate is 15%   which is $5  mind you i never ever in life  tip less than 15% ever for slow and rude services!!!! i was once a waiter  i know how that might feel!
insanely cheap! great for late night eats but the soup dumplings here are just ok 6 pork xlb (soup dumplings) for $5 95  3 stars  the skin was too thick and slightly undercooked  generously meaty and soupy though  i also like that they give you tongs so that you don't break the skin 6 crab and pork xlb for $6 95  2 5 stars  stick to the pork ones especially if you're not a fan of crab roe  seafood taste overpowered the pork fried bean gluten $5 95  5 stars  an acquired taste so stay away if you're not a fan of greasy tofu  flavorful and just the right amount of chewy they make it just like my aunt does back in taiwan  the mushrooms and bamboo shoots that accompany the gluten are equally delightful cold sweet soy milk for $1 50  5 stars  authentic  none of that american silk crap 
finally made the trek out here to try these famous soup dumplings  fairly long wait 30$ min for table for two on a friday night; however they give you a ticket and you can go outs and about in flushing and grab some bubble tea while you wait  soup dumplings  as good as any other  i have to say though the dough was a little thicker in comparison to other recent soup dumpling places i've tried recently  perhaps some prefer this but prefer the dough on the thinner side  regretfully didn't get to try the scallion pancakes with beef filling   
poor hygiene  long waiting time  waitress don't take customers even tables are empty 
love this place for their soup dumplings and veg chicken and tufu   a long wait line is worth it 
very bad customer service     long wait on everything  don't go have here!!! there is so many restaurants in flushing  why going somewhere that is unpleasant?
i fell in love with chinese food after my visit here  being a korean  i never had authentic shanghai food  i've had my fair share of peking duck but that was the extent of my chinese food experience  since i came to visit nyc for the first time  my friends decided to take me here saying it would be worth it  and i can say that they were right  this is one of those cash only hidden restaurants  once we got here we ordered a wide variety of stuff of which none failed to disappoint  starting with the scallion pancake with beef i believe  and the soup dumplings with crab and pork  after feeling like we were lacking another dish  we ordered a pig ear dish which was surprisingly delicious  to those who have not tried it try it! it does not taste odd funky crazy or any other negative adjective that might come to mind haha  oh and did i mention 9 people ate comfortable for about $100 
**tourist hub**food is so mediocre  service is so crappy  i got the braised beef noodle soup  two orders of the pork soup dumplings and one of the crab  and the xiao mei  the braised beef noodle soup was lackluster  it came with 3 4 pieces of cilantro  the noodles were doughy  and the soup was thin  the menu said it was spicy but to who?? i had to ask for the chili peppers two times from a waiter because it wasn't on our tables and he forgot the first time i asked  the restaurant wasn't even busy; half my time there i saw him standing on the side and waiting for the food to come out from the kitchen   the soup dumplings were doughy (but not as much as joe shanghai's i'll give them that)the xiao mei  apparently the waiters have a hard time keeping track of orders because we received scallion pancakes which we didn't order  but was charged for  and the xiao mei came 10 minutes after we got the rest of the meal  we spotted it first on the table next to ours  and after the couple told the waiter it wasn't theres  it traveled across the other side of the restaurant and eventually found its way to us  they were cold and the taste didn't do any justice to the wait  after the horrible service i received the first time i came last year  i decided to give this another shot  and was just completely enamored by how crappy their service is  i don't bother writing reviews of crappy restaurants but this one was especially bad  i went to kung fu xiao long bao the next day and received food and service that was a hundredfold better than this restaurant's  do yourself a favor and check kung fu out!!!!!!!!! dear tourists  this is where you want to get your soup dumpling experience!!!
decided to head over to nan xiang xiao long bao for an early lunch via nyc subway  it was well worth the trip  i'm used to din tai fung's thin wrapper dumplings  i don't believe din tai fung has made it to the east coast  there are several in california  din tai fung's juicy steam dumplings are the standard i use to rate dumplings  din tai fung's wrapper is super thin and delicate  so  when i say "thick " it's all relative i've had other soup dumplings with thick wrappers  and they have all been subpar  i thought that the thick wrapper took away from the flavor of the broth  well   nan xiang xiao long bao proved me wrong  the broth  encased in the thick stretchy wrapper  was rich & flavorful! you can't go wrong with the steamed pork buns and the steamed crab & pork buns 
cash only!!! this place was delicious  comparing it to din tai fung (my go to)  the xlb had more meat and more soup  the scallion pancake with the sliced beef was to die for! it combines two of my fave dishes   they add the beef with the peking duck fixings (sauce  scallions)! it's a must order  definitely coming back!
been here twice for dinner   definitely not worth the crazy wait   ordered a soup dumpling  rice cake  pan fried seafood noodle which had a ton of cabbage  they were all decent to me

yes! officially my favorite soup dumpling restaurant! sorry  joe's shanghai and joe's ginger  the restaurant is always packed on weekend nights so keep that in mind when coming here  however  if you get here around 7pm  you should be able to grab a table  the restaurant is no frills  but the service is actually quite decent compared to my other experiences in chinatown and flushing as for the food     2 words     soup dumplings! immediately  after you plop down on your seat  you should ask for an order of soup dumplings    as to which type of protein feel free to ask the waiter  then after that  feel free to browse the menu and order miscellaneous items of your liking  personally  i'm a huge cold appetizers and crispy noodle fan so we also ordered the jelly fish   the jelly fish is servede with turnip  so it might turn off some people  but more the merrier for me! the jelly fish was real flavorful and some of the best i've ever had scallion pancake with slice beef   they serve you 3 huge pieces  the skin was soft and the beef was marinated perfectly inside the pancake  despite being full  we devoured this with ease crispy noodle with shredded chicken   another excellent dish! the noodle was very cripsy and there was more than a fair share of chicken  mushrooms  misc toppings and sauce as for the soup dumplings  they were very good too  we were used to being served the customary 8 pieces at other restaurants  so were a bit surprised to only see 6 in one order  other than that  no complaints  i definitely will be planning more future trips here      very very soon!
ive came here a dozen of times   food is good   dumplings take longer than expected but for the taste and price its worth the wait 
normally i go for joe shanghai's when i think of soup dumplings but when visiting flushing  nan xiang dumpling house is where the soup dumplings are at!at a cheaper price  you have the option of either the pork or pork and crab soup dumplings   we had both which came with 6 nicely sized dumplings filled with so much delicious soup    the two options had different flavors to the soup but they were both full of flavor and not bland like some other places that try to do soup dumplings   i would go to say that this soup dumpling rivals that of joe shanghai's!not a perfect 5 star rating though   we did order other things on the menu which were mediocre at best    we had the beef over crispy noodles and while the noodles were very delicious  the beef were cut into very  very thin strips    there was so little beef in the dish so it was disappointing   we did also order a 'cold' appetizer in the spicy beef and tripe dish    again  disappointed   way too much tripe and not enough beef   the little bit of beef found among the heaps of tripe were seasoned pretty good though ending note  pro tip   just come here for the soup dumplings  order a lot  and that's it!
terrible experience for takeout  tofu is not cook well   make me so sick of it  don't come this place ever when u finish ur food  u can feel ur stomach really uncomfortable   i throw away all the food  really really terrible feelings! never gonna come again  
we helped this place when were in the area  we ordered 6 dishes the udon noodles very fresh and tasty  the scallion pancakes were fluffy and crunchy and not greasy at all  pork fried dumplings were really good  the shredded potato salad who would have thought ? incredibly tasty i have to learn  to make this and the cucumber and garlic salad i can't say enough about those two dishes don't eat here with out ordering these  the pork dumplings in peanut sauce i didn't try  they came out last and by that time i was stuffed! my boyfriend reports that the first bite was ok then the combination of flavors hit the back of his tongue and it was incredible flavor  i left out one star because the floors were really dirty and the tags they wiped the tables with needed to be burned 
a mecca for xiaolongbao in ny  it is a bit of a journey out to flushing on the temperamental 7 train  nevertheless  nan xiang xlb's soup to dumpling ratio is the highest that i've ever consumed  the steaming broth fills and satisfies all crevices of your mouth  get the scallion pancake with sliced beef to round out your hearty meal  i would make a trek out here once in a dumpling moon  but other shanghainese restaurants in manhattan are more than enough to satisfy my urges 
growing up in flushing  finding places to eat soup dumplings were always an adventure for my family  nan xiang is decent  but i don't understand all the hype  the staff (when i went in the morning) were kind of rude and the food is mediocre at best  i'm sure this restaurant has seen better days  but places such as shanghai you garden offer better quality soup dumplings (with a free basket if you bought over $10 worth of food)
i do love good xiao long bao's (xlb for short)  they have been more consistent now   really enjoy their various breakfast food   scallion pancake  pan fried buns  salty and sweet tofu pudding   it's all good   gotta get there early ( before 10am) or you will have a long wait 
without question  my favorite shanghainese breakfast spot in new york  it's a bit out of the way for me (it's located in downtown flushing)  but definitely worth a visit when you're in the area and even worth making a trip on the 7 train  get the soup dumplings  some scallion pancakes with or sans beef  some tripe  and you'll be a happy and full human  you will usually have to queue for a little bit (or a long bit)  but you'll be glad that you did 
i was hankering for something tasty when i stumbled on this place through yelp  so i got my trusty metro card and swiped my way to flushing  queens  the restaurant is extremely big  because i originally thought it was small until the waitress walked my sister and i through the restaurant to a spacious seating area  we didn't have to wait long to be seated or served we got there around 1 o'clock and all the waitress were very attentive  we were seated and handed menus immediately  my sister and i ordered the crab and pork dumplings  the beef scallion pancake  and the seafood udon noodles  since nan xiang xiao long bao serves large portion were shared everything  let's talk about how good the seafood udon noodles were  which consisted of shrimp and crab meat  that was the first dish that was served to us and it was hot as in the noodle had steam coming off of them  but it was not scolding hot   that how food should be severed to customers  it was delicious  using my chop sticks i pick up those noodles and it tasted like a well season noodle from heaven  i loved it   the udon noodles were extremely good  whatever sauced they used on the udon noodles it  was absorbed by the shrimp and crab meat and it enhances the savory flavor  the udon seafood dish is to die for  literally   i also noticed that the udon noodles had mini bok choy leaves in it  our second dish that came out was the steamed pork and crab soup dumpling  the crab and pork are minced and mixed together inside the dumpling  that's another must try dish  it tasted amazing  the moment my sister bit into the dumpling the soup juice squirted all over the table  that was pretty funny  i knew it was good because she wasn't speaking just chewing  the beef scallion pancake was okay  whatever sauce was inside i guess it was barbecue sauce made it too sweet  the scallion pancake itself tasted good but i didn't like that sweet sauce inside of it  not my favorite  however  i loved the service; the atmosphere; and the food  i highly recommend that you come out here and try the food  get the udon noodles lol!
update  still 5 stars  awesome consistency with the wrapper  not too thick and not too thin  it has the perfect balance to hold the flavorful  juicy broth inside 
just a short walk from the mall  my family and i traveled after our shopping trip and were seated right away! this place is cash only so make sure you pull out some cash  you won't need much though because we were able to feed 5 people; with each person having several plates of food  for $60  the food was really tasty  we actually ordered some plates twice  and my parents really enjoyed their meal  i'm vegetarian vegan so i was able to have some options  my only complaint would be the greasiness of the food after i ate it  some of the food was bathing in oil and it made me feel a bit queasy (i always feel sick after i consume too much oil) but this wouldn't prevent me from coming again!
food was amazing  the part not amazing is if you dont tip and the waitress makes you feel guilty and yells at you and everything  in asia tipping is consider a sin and extortion  i mean you finish eating u have a food coma  the best way is to pay the bill and go  not think ooh how's the service? did they keep water or tea full? should i tip 5% or 10% or 15% or maybe 20%  ooh wait i can't think i need my calculator   worst thing i ate over $60 with my friend and i  two people and they still want a tip?!? wtf?!? only gets the extra star due to food  try not tipping and you will see 
omg! i can't believe this place has so many reviews  of course i had to come here to see what the hype is about  the food here is delicious  i wish they had more vegetarian options  this place has good amount of seating space  it is clean  and service is great  definitely seems like a hang out spot for the locals and asian people  i have seen all different types of ethnicities here though  i love that about nyc  i will be back!
the last time i ate xlb was at din tai fung in taipei  i'm not a big fan of pork so even din tai fung's xlb did not impress me much; their xlb skin was very delicate & delicious though  similar to din tai fung  the wait for nan xiang was no joke  i waited close to 30 minutes for a sunday around 1 pm  which with so many other restaurants in flushing i could've easily escaped to  is a very long time  after being seated  i ordered the beef scallion pancake  beef & chili noodle soup and xlb x2 for my boyfriend and i  beef scallion pancake was not the best i've had but tolerable  beef & chili noodle soup tasted like msg infused broth  therefore  the highlight was definitely the xlb  while the skin of the xlb can't compare to din tai fung's  the flavor of the pork was much better in my opinion  for somebody who doesn't even like xlb  this place won my heart  prices are also very fair for such a popular restaurant among locals and tourists alike  service is what you would expect from a busy restaurant in flushing  nothing to rave about  some to complain about but really  who would care?
the first time i ever had soup dumplings and they were out of this world  well  better than i ever expected soup dumplings could be  the udon noodles were incredible too
getting straight to the point  food was still good  service was literally shit  we ordered one order of the pork soup dumplings and one order of the crab meat ones as well  we got our other orders of noodles and scallion pancakes pretty quick  as usual  the soup dumplings on the other hand  took forever to come out (20+ mins) and on top of that  we didn't get the order of the crab meat dumplings  my friend told the waitress that we were missing an order but the waitress retaliated back by stating that she had only written one order of the dumplings down  instead of wanting to make it an even bigger incident  we just left it as is and ate the single order of pork dumplings  that's the first fault in this updated review  the waitress never said sorry nor did she bother to confirm the orders with us in case there was some form of miscommunication  which did happen  adding on to that  our dumplings took longer than usual to come out  i've been here multiple times and our dumplings never took longer than 10 15 mins no matter how busy the place got  also  it was hard to get someone to take our order in the first place even though i made eye contact several times with a different male waiter secondly  since that waitress left us dissatisfied  we decided to leave a tip of $2  granted  that's basically nothing but my friends and i didn't feel like they deserved any more  after leaving  i had a feeling that someone would come out running demanding for more tips and guess what  i was right  my friend (since she's more fluent than us in chinese)  explained why we left the amount that we did  waiter stated that he was sorry but he doesn't get a paycheck and only relies on the tips he gets  a sorry means nothing in our books  we're good tippers especially if the service is great and tips reflect the service that we get; they're not mandatory  after having said all that  although the waiter kept saying sorry and was trying to be nice about the whole situation  we just left  there's nothing more embarrassing than having to chase a customer and be chased by a restaurant staff member demanding for more tips if they know that they didn't provide decent service  nan xiang  i love your food but i won't be back for a while 
c'mon now  you already know what you're getting into  soup dumplings are what they're known for but their other stuff is just as delicious  greasy  oily plates of good old comfort food  the dumplings are great in whatever form   soup  steamed or fried  then make sure to add the pan fried noodles or the scallion pancakes w  beef   so friggin moist and warm and crunchy  waiting on line has never been a problem for me  although i tend to come for dinner on weeknights  they've been rapidly expanding so there's a lot of room  although i hear weekends are a killer and there can be a bit of a wait during prime lunch hours  but still worth it service is a bit lacking and communication can be a bit of a problem sometimes  but not for their lack of trying  who cares when the prices are this cheap!?cash onlyyyyyyyy
best soup dumplings in the neighborhood  some of their other dishes are hit or miss which is disappointing  the majority of the staff being unable to speak english fluently is frustrating at times  they have pictures of alot of food simplifying ordering  but some of those foods aren't all that good  but again best dumplings so expect a long wait 
definitely recommend! the soup dumplings were fire  we also got the beef scallion pancakes  they were heavier than expected so one order is good to split between two people  the food came out really quick  10 10 would eat fire dumplings again
this shanghai style dim sum restaurant is a cut above the rest in flushing  the decor is simple; the prices are fair  and oh those sumptuous  delicious dumplings! go there on off hours  if you can  this place gets mobbed at peak times 
this is a great shanghai restaurant in flushing new york has great food and comfortable seedings  it started out as a small restaurant but with the high volume of loyal customers they were able to expand the restaurants  we always order the shanghai dumplings  noodles  fried pork buns  scallion pancake  and much more when we come  the sad for super friendly they have sufficient amount of wait staff and the wait for a table is not that long  the prices are fair and you gets to walk away happy  i do recommend this place to a lot of my friends and they have intern continue to return to the restaurant and bring their friends 
for less than $50 (plus tip)  our party of four received    18 pork soup dumplings (rich  incredible)  6 crab pork soup dumplings (still rich but more balanced and even more incredible)   6 veggie dumplings (full of perfectly cooked greens)  scallion pancake with beef and hoisin (golden brown savory sweet indulgence of doom)  a plate of garlic cucumbers (cool  crisp and lovely with a drizzle of chili oil)   a plate of rice cakes with shredded pork (a bizarre yet amazing mound of chewy little discs just begging to be smothered in chili oil and toasty chili flakes)  i strained to find something to nitpick  but this spot really is lights out fantastic  especially for the price 
the best scallion pancakes in town! you know the food spot is amazing when all the locals go!
rice cakes are a must  the food is all good but those were amazing! great welcome to flushing i also got some thick noodles but don't remember what they're called right now  service is whatever but fast  food is cheap but really yummy 
"service with   out a smile"  but it had the best dumplings and scallion pancakes i've ever had  service was quick  and wait time for our table on a very busy night was minimal  as they're great at turning over tables here  my favorite part about this place  though  might have to be that their host manager looks like a chinese dick cheney  go for the food  but stay for the "dick chiney" 
crabmeat and pork soup dumplings on a cold day or any day as a matter of fact  this restaurant has very fast service  food is fresh and delicious  the dumplings have an amazing skin and just the right amount of filling  definitely a go to spot for these 
amazing experience  totally worth the 1 hour train ride to get there  everything is on point! my personal favorite was the scalion pancake with sliced beef  so much flavor! my friend and i ordered the pancake  steamed dumpling  fried buns  and the shao mai  we were not able to finish it all and the check totaled 21 bucks! simply an amazing deal 
i had my first xlb experience here and i fell in love!! the crab xlb is seriously to die for!! so juicy  savory  and flavorful! we usually get seated immediately and the food comes out very fast  i took out 1 star because the server lady got mad at me because i told her don't speak chinese lol   but who cares?? when i tasted the xlb i didn't care about anything because it was so delish  the price is really great too!! we got 5 orders of crab xlb and 3 cans of soda btw my sister and i and it came out to around 40 and we were soooo full  definitely a place to visit every time i'm in nyc 
i love this place! love like i could eat here everyday  and to be honest  this is the third day in a row that i've found myself here  i literally crave the soup dumplings and scallion pancakes  the spicy beef and tripe is great  the garlic cucumbers fantastic and refreshing  i have yet to find something that i didn't like  if u don't live in flushing  it's worth the commute!
excellent soup dumplings and scallion pancakes at very affordable prices  parking in the area is tough 
nan xiang is my favorite place to go to for soup dumplings! even though it's a trek (flushing is far!)  i love coming here  i've personally never been here on a weekend  so i've never had to wait to get seated  i went yesterday (tuesday) around 7pm and was seated right away i always order the pork soup dumplings and it is delicious  it's 1000% better than joe's shanghai  so much better the scallion pancakes here are amazing  they are doughy and crispy  just how i like them  from the appetizer menu  i love ordering the spicy beef & tripe  the iced soy bean milk is a must when you come here  it just pairs so well with everything i ordered the shanghai pan fried u don for the first time yesterday and wasn't too impressed with it considering that it's recommended a lot here  it's pretty standard  and i felt like our noodles were a bit undercooked 
xia long bao was delicious and juicy! it's very busy on the weekends but the service and was quick and efficient 
this place is very authentic  i had many soup dumplings when i was growing up in china  and this place really reminded me of those days  their dumplings have nice size  good taste  and the juice is just satisfying  they also have some selections of dim sum  and szechuan food  which is great for a spicy food lover like me  on average the wait time is 1 2 min  and i get a seat  but i usually go there alone so that might be the reason  they have two big dining areas with plenty of seat  so if you go around 10pm or later  there's no need to wait in line  service was ok  nothing real fancy  the get you your food pretty quickly  and are very helpful if you need get your water filled or order something else  only draw back is they only accept cash  for me  i usually eat a lot  and spent around 23 dollars  so now you know how much to bring 
came in the morning with a friend to have some soup dumplings  noodles  and soy milk for breakfast i enjoyed all the food  was pretty full and happy with the cheap price! it was my first visit so i didn't know it was cash only  but luckily my friend already knew!service could be a bit better  as near the end we were waiting for the check for quite a bit 
this place has gone downhill  what happened to the staff?been here countless times over many many years but never experienced such horrible service today  waitresses were clearly frustrated   stressed    they ran out of cups for tea  kept talking in their native language about what name brand jackets customers had (yes  i understood)  how much tip each table left  and took forever to get our check and give us back our change  we ended up walking up to the front desk to get it   and the receptionist   clerk was super rude  she said in the nastiest tone  "i dooon't know which one is yours!" she even made hand gestures like idgaf  honestly  i didn't want to leave any tip  other tables were agitated by the slow service as well    with such a big restaurant  they should do a better job hiring and training staff    beef scallion pancake was salty from too much sauce  beef to pancake ratio was nearly nonexistent  crabmeat soup dumplings are pretty good though  but in totality  i will give this place two stars  joe's shanghai  kung fu xlb  and shanghai you garden all have better food and definitely better service 
honestly brings nostalgia and childhood to my taste buds  their small  side dishes are packed with flavor  these dishes are relatively cheap as well  so you may find yourself ordering many baskets of soup dumplings and many plates of scallion pancakes  there's often a wait for seats during the weekends  but it's always worth the time 
i used to come here all the time for the soup dumplings  scallion pancakes  and rice rolls  but the service and the quality of the food has deteriorated over the years tried to come here last weekend for breakfast with the family  when i walked in  there was no one there to greet us  a lady sitting behind the counter did not even look up  i walked up to her and asked her for a table of 4  she did not even look up at us and was staring down at her screen the entire time  and said "just wait" in a nasty tone  terrible service  and so we did for about 15 minutes  someone else came in after us and asked a waitress who was passing by for a table  the waitress gave her a number  if there was a number system in place for tables  it would have been nice if we got a number from the start  instead we ended up waiting 15 more minutes than we should have i typically am not picky about the service and would go to any hole in the wall for good food  but the poor service was way below what the service used to be won't be coming back in the future  there are plenty of other xiaolongbao places nearby with just as good food and even better service 
when i needed help with my knee about four years ago i came here and boy was i happy i did  the doctor took out the fluids in my hurt knee and then did therapy here and i loved it  ladies and gentlemen were so nice 
amazing pork dumplings and fried udon noodle  we got other pork dumplings that were fried and were not as good  the chili and pork soup had a nice broth flavor and the fried pork chop were nice but could have used a dipping sauce  we had to ask often for more tea and the wait staff was not very friendly   i will absolutely come back for the soup dumplings and fried udon noodle  not sure a vegetarian would fair well here 
i've been coming here for years with the family before all the yelp buzz  my most recent visit was a bit disappointing  there were pieces of sharp crab shell shrapnel buried in our crab xiao long bao  this is unacceptable   we could have been seriously hurt (esophageal laceration) if we tried swallowing without chewing carefully  pretty thoughtless on the part of the person making the dumplings  on the bright side at least i know they are using real crab meat  the taste itself was very good as was the regular xiao long bao  the quality difference between the soup dumplings here vs the many other restaurants in the area is diminishing  however  there are a lot more options these days the spicy beef tripe was quite greasy but was probably the highlight of the meal in my opinion   it tastes great mixed with rice 
why 5*s this time as opposed to 4*s last?  well  fairly easy  i followed my own advice  i went at an off time  sort of   i took my daughter who was craving soup dumplings and she had an off day from school   we decided to do a dumpling "crawl" and hit two other places after nan xiang (because of the rain and time constraints we just went to another place   imo a contender for best xlb)   and given we were going to other restaurants we held off on the tripe and beef salad (in the multitude of times that i have been that tripe and beef has been nothing less than stellar) and just ordered the pork xiao long bao and the crab and pork   the place was fairly empty (a rainy winter tuesday at 11 30) so service was adequate  which for here is a huge step up   after 15 or so minutes out they arrived   twelve perfectly steamed xlbs   deciding on which is better  pork or the pork with crab  really will depend on your mood   today  the pork and crab won out  by a smidge   a dash of vinegar soy  a strand of garlic and a couple drops of hot chili oil   awesome   as i have said before  i don't think you will find better xlbs in the tri state area for the money   until today when we drove a little further 
this is the best place to get xlb  the service is fast and the food is consistently delicious  i've been here quite a few times with my family  and everyone enjoys it i recommend getting the shanghai noodles  regular pork soup dumplings  and soy milk with chinese donuts  the noodles are addicting  and the dumplings have so much soup inside them  the soup is brothy and fresh  you won't be able to stop eating them! side note  they don't accept credit card here 
freshly made xiao long bao and a simple menu that doesn't confuse you 
the wait for this restaurant was 20 minutes  but it was definitely worth the wait  this place was packed out at 9 pm  so you know it's a great spot  we came here as our first stop in our restaurant hopping trip and i wish we hadn't of left to go to another restaurant! the soup dumplings were the best i ever had and they were priced very well  the noodles were great and the beef scallion pancakes were also great i plan on making this a necessary stop the next time i come to nyc 
i come a lot with my parents to flushing to eat and we always see how packed nan xiang is (one of the reasons we never went in ) we decided to start sunday funday there and check out what all the hype was about let me start by saying that yes outside is packed because basically there is no room to eat inside  so don't let the amount of people outside phase you  the lady told us 15 20    she took us in about 10  we ordered two crab and pork soup dumplings (basically in dumpling heaven) and the scallion pancakes filled with beef  it is a bit filling not as light as scallion pancakes but were very good  the rest of our food was brought out to us in a quick reasonable timing  the waitress seemed busy but whenever we asked for something she was very attentive to our needs  always a plus! we found a new authentic restaurant in flushing  our favorite!!
amazing xiao long bao!! i actually am not sure how good other menu are  the soup was ok  next time i would like to try there breads!
my friends and i made a weekend trio to nyc and stopped by flushing for some serious chinese food eats  this was our stop as it's famous for soup dumplings  the bathroom's alright  decently clean for a chinese place and the dining area is family oriented and clean  we got that and an order of shu mai  the soup dumplings were definitely in point  soupy inside  the dough didn't stick on the paper in the steamer which i'd think is high quality  the shu mai wrapper is thin  good  but i found it odd that it had rice inside  that i wasn't used to  i'll give this place a 3 5 tbh  4 for dumplings and 3 for shu mai  still good chinese food  i'd go again 
i can't believe that i am writing this  could it possibility be that the soup dumplings isn't as good as i remembered it to be the soup dumplings (xiao long bao) was good  but nothing wowed me about it  the soup was good  the pork was alright  maybe it wasn't fresh or something  the wow factor wasn't there  maybe i came on an off day   in one of my crab & pork dumplings  there was a piece of crab shell  gotta be careful about those shells  in addition  we ordered the pig ears  spicy tripe and beef pancakes  the pig ear was good  but there are better ones in flushing  the spicy tripe was definitely spicy  kinda wish that they offered rice  unless you are a lover for spicy food  the tripe might be a bit much  the beef pancake was good  remember to eat when its hot  at the end of the night  the best food was still the xiao long bao  it should have the highlight of the meal  but it wasn't  service was subpar kinda expected it  but atleast refill other people's drink and pay attention to customers  i finished my tea  but had to wait to get a waiter attention that i would like some more tea  at times  i found that the waiter wasn't paying attention to the customers even when we tried to get their attention for the bill  the picture menu is a nice touch  as it was very easy to order food 
visiting from california and this was one of the spots that i had to try while in new york  came with my girlfriend  location isn't hard to find but we weren't sure if we were in the right place since the sign isn't in english  the food  ordered the scallion pancakes and the famous xiao long bao  5 5 would recommend the pancakes  i was expecting a flat pan fried scallion pancake like all the other places i've been to  but when they brought it out my eyes popped a little bit  they bring you this super crispy  nice golden colored pancake  it could have used a pinch of salt but i think that's a personal preference (added a few drops of soy sauce myself)the soup dumplings were fantastic  very rich and strong taste to the soup  good amount of soup in each dumpling  wasn't too over powering  the meat was on the soft side  the skin was dry  a little too much dough for my own liking  overall great place to get soup dumplings cons to my experience was the service  we ordered our food and received our pancakes in a timely manner but it took an extremely long time for our dumplings to come out  parties that came after us sat down  ordered  and received theirs first  and i know that it was probably an honest mistake  but it left a bad experience for myself because i asked them to check up on my order and they didn't even apologize for the wait  hopefully the next time i come for the dumplings i will have a better experience and change my review 
place is alright  its no din tai fung but the soup dumplings are edible  the noodles are ok  nothing to write home about  popular spot but the food is like joes shangai  be aware that the tea plastic cups aren't all fully clean   my fiancé spent 15 minutes trying to wipe off crusted on tea    
the best soup dumplings around  love their crab one the best  the rest of their menu is either good or great  most items are under $10   i took my family (5 people) and we were all so happy and bellies full with just spending only $60 
i have eaten here for breakfast  lunch and dinner and this place just never disappoints! whenever i don't know what to eat close to main street  it is always a battle between this or the dry hot pot  the food here is oily  greasy and relatively cheap but pleasantly enjoyable!i came here last night  thursday night  with my family to enjoy dinner  we were seated right away but by the door and as you know  when the door opens and closes   you feel all the wind! immediately when you walk in it looks super small  like there are only 5 tables but how can that be plausible for a place with such an overwhelming amount of positive yelp reviews? well  they have an extension to their restaurant which seats loads of other people once you walk in we were handed the menu right away  the menu is pretty simple  not many pages to it  just a long sheet of paper that has been laminated front and back  i took pictures of everything we ordered so you can see below! the food is pretty good and definitely cheap  the sweet soy milk is actually not that sweet  but i'm okay with that because you can always add sugar to your liking  the salt soy milk gets a lower grade to me than the sweet soy milk  kind of tastes like soup? i don't know  not really my type of thing  the pan fried pork buns were one of the best i've had   though  i usually try it from food carts and those are extremely oily and it's just a mess  but these! they are crispy on the bottom  just the right amount of moist and delicious filling! the seafood udon  though i was most excited about this  was probably the most disappointing  first  they are not true udon noodles and they were given to us kind of cold  the sauce is not to my liking  and i've had seafood udon at other places   i guess every place makes it differently but this was not consistent with what i've had at 'most' places  the fried bun with chives and egg  although is a vegetarian option  is actually surprisingly delicious! it has a kick of spice in it  not sure where it came from though! everyone raved about the beef scallion pancake  and although we opt'd out for the beef   the regular scallion pancake is terrible! super oily!! of course  the highlight of this place is the soup dumpling which definitely did not disappoint  i feel like the more soup dumplings you have  the more your stomach just fiends for it haha!! remember to get the ginger from the kitchen (by asking the waitress) if they did not already remember to bring it to your table  the concoction of ginger and vinegar mixed together and pour over the soup dumpling is orgasmic in your mouth! overall  this place is not the best in service and one of the things i dislike most  cash only concepts  are shown here  but  the food is great for the price that you pay  it definitely wouldn't ruin your day to grab a breakfast lunch dinner here 
came here saturday for lunch  there were a lot of people waiting in line  but as previous reviews suggested  the line moves fast  about 10 15mins i was seated  i also liked the fact unlike other busy small restaurants  they didn't ask me to share a table with a stranger just because i was by myself  i ordered cold soy milk  beef and tripe  scallion pancake with beef  and crab xlb (for which i was told the wait was 30 45mins  what!!???) beef and tripe was pretty good  it was not like up to your face spicy as many other similar dishes  the kick was still there but in a much mellow and savory way  i liked this dish scallion pancake with beef also lived up to my expectations  crunchy  chewy  and flaky pancake  well seasoned beef  all held together by that black sweet savory sauce (i believe it was tian mian jiang in chinese)  crab xlb didn't impress me as i had hoped  i blame partially on the fact that it was brought over 40mins into my lunch  by that time i was almost full and six additional heavy juicy meat buns seemed a little overwhelming  i finished them no matter what but i honestly couldn't taste much of crab part  and the meat juice was a bit fattier oiler than joe's shanghai and definitely than din tai fung  (maybe my taste buds were already overloaded with msg and spices by that time  ) anyways everyone has a preferred style of soup dumplings  if you are into thick and chewy skinned  heavy meat juiced xlb  nan xiang is your bae loli recommend going there in a group so you can sample much more dishes without paying much  since i went there alone  i ended up paying close to $30 (tax included) for the things ordered
was underwhelmed  scallion beef pancakes where very oily  soup dumplings were better but not amazing    fast service though 
a solid 4 stars  this is my first pick for soup dumplings (xiao long bao) in flushing  joe's shanghai is great too but there can be a wait  for this place  i never have to wait to be seated nan xiang is well known for their soup dumplings and sesame pancakes  you get 6 dumplings for $5 95 (pork) and $6 95 (crab)  their soup dumplings are great but their sesame pancakes are flippin fantastic  personally i dislike their noodles and dumplings but everything else is great  their service can be a real hit or miss  usually the servers are nice but there are times when they are rude or apathetic  despite that  many come here for good food not service 
mediocre service food was ok for the price  but just tossing the food on the table and not giving me a soup spoon for a freaking order of soup dumplings  then giving me a pissed look for even asking? wow  then to top it all off watching the server running out the door asking for a bigger tip? i thought gratuity was 1) optional and 2)meant to indicate to your server your level of satisfaction with their performance  customer beware!
i don't know if it was our lucky day  but everything here was perfect! the staff was super friendly and nice  as well as attentive  the food succeeded my expectations and then some!the crab and pork soup dumplings were juicy as i ever had  the skin was thin as can be  still able to grab each dumpling without piercing  the seafood noodle was filling all to itself  the soy milk goes perfect the youtiao  what else can be said  that hasn't already been said? this place is worth the trip  local or traveller!
this is a hole in the wall cheap easy in china town you should not miss  the pork bum is really good  you won't go wrong with your order id you like chinese dumplings 
came here on a saturday night around 11 30pm  there was plenty of seating  we were served tea and ordered soup and veggie dumplings and beef scallion pancakes  soup dumplings are flavorful  the veggie dumplings are packed with veggies  the beef in the scallion pancake was way too sweet for my liking but i would get the regular scallion pancakes again  i definitely recommend stopping by here  i shared everything with a friend and the total was around $18  so inexpensive 
found this place by way of a cheap eats article online and it just happened to be right around the corner from our hotel  double win  the food was perfect  you know how the best ethnic cuisine is simply flavored with great fresh ingredients and not overly complex? well that's the perfect description for everything our family tried here  we had steamed pork buns and pan fried dumplings along with the garlic cucumbers for appetizers   it was all amazing but the cucumbers were my favorite  it's not always easy to find good vegetables while traveling and eating out and these were right on time  next we had the scallion pancake  the crust was a perfection of flakiness  better than a croissant! the beef was a bit sweet for my taste but i literally have nothing to compare it to as this was my first scallion pancake ever  the flavor was good though   then we had the crispy noodles with seafood which surpassed all of my expectations  the fish was delightful and i almost cried when my son dropped one of the shrimp on the floor and for a second i even considered picking it up and wiping it off but thankfully i passed  the vegetables were fresh and crunchy and the sauce was light and just the right amount  the noodles were awesome too  the third dish we had was shredded beef with rice cakes and this was my favorite after the cucumbers  the flavor was a lightly smokey and the mushrooms were marinated so well i could have eaten a whole plate of them all by myself  there was little beef which i actually prefer because then i get to eat more veggies  healthy choices people! for some reason i'd expected this dish to have a sweet sauce but was in no way disappointed when it was not sweet  the veggies in here were just right too and the only thing left on the whole table after dinner was a few bites of rice cake we were just too full to force down  my family of 4  2 adults and 2 elementary age kids dined well here for a total of $52 which included a 20% tip  i thought that was very reasonable  and i'm an out of towner 
this is one the best authentic chinese restaurants in flushing  love the seafood soup and steak vegetable dumplings  note cash only 
authentic  crowded and noisy chinese restaurant with extra!  since the reviews were so good for the dumplings and scallion pancakes that is exactly what i ordered  me and a coworker split four dishes and left quite full  the fried pork dumpling and fried pork but was probably my favorite  very savory and hot  my next favorite was the scallion pancake with beef  this had a complex flavor  mixing the hoisen tasting beef with the scallion and a slightly sweet pancake holding it all together  if i could have eaten more of any of the dishes  this would have been the one  the last dish was the pork and crab dumpling  it was good but i wasn't ready for the amount of liquid inside the dumpling  i totally exploded one down my shirt  this place is obviously popular with locals and tourists  unlike some of the other restaurants in the area  you definitely won't be the only anglo in here  cash only 
worth the hype the pork steamed buns and crab & pork steamed buns were pretty good  the soup tasted so refreshing like a hot broth and the meat was juicy and succulent  both buns tasted the same to me  they use fresh crab  i found pieces of crab shells inside one of the buns  skip on the shanghai shao mei  it's just basically sticky rice filled in shao mei wrappers   it was pretty bland compared to their soup dumplings  the scallion pancake with beef should not be missed  definitely one of the best scallion pancakes i've had in nyc  prices are a steal for what you pay at joe's shanghai and anywhere else in chinatown  definitely recommend if you're in this area or if you never had soup dumplings 
the dumplings were delicious   we had the vegetable  pan fried and the xiao long bao and they were all fantastic   the service was prompt and the food staff friendly 
honestly this place has one of the best soup dumplings i have ever tasted  it is a very welcoming place but the seats are very close together and sometimes the wait can be very long   the food is delicious and inexpensive! i ordered the scallion pancake  three orders of soup dumplings  pork pan fried dumplings  and three sodas all for $30  the waiters did come across as a bit rude but the quick service made up for it  great place 10 10 would go again and i'm looking forward to it 
the scallion pancake with beef was pretty tasty and very crispy  however  it was a bit thick and extremely greasy  but still i finished it because it was so good!the xiao long bao was delicious and lived up to its reputation  it was really soupy and piping hot  which is something that's lacking in some other shanghai places  and this one did not let us down  the amount of meat was slightly less than expected  but the taste and quality more than made up for it the service was decent  pretty quick    what else can you ask at this kind of place?
this place is nice to eat at the food is a fair price and the taste is good i have not  had everything on the menu but i like it    )
"baby i like your style"   drakei really like the soup dumpling style at this restaurant     i pretty much only get that here   each dumpling consistently has soup which is a sign of great craftmanship
my family always comes here when we go to flushing  the food is cheap  authentic  and delicious  in addition to the xiao long  the shumai here is one of my favorites  i haven't tasted an item off the menu that i haven't enjoyed 
this is my friends and i's go to stop for xiao long bao (soup dumplings)  it can get pretty crowded so you might have to wait to be seated  however  popular as it is  i find that the flavoring of their food is pretty standard  nothing too special  i usually get the preserved cabbage with pork & noodles  which is good  and satisfies my hunger  the only reason i'm giving 3 stars is that the service can be rather slow  the other day i went and had a waitress acknowledge my request to order twice  but not actually taking my order (like she looked at me waving her over and then walked away  the other time she said "ok i'll be right there" and did not come to us)  i figured it was because they were busy  but it was just really annoying  same thing when we wanted our bill  and they didn't give us our change back  it wasn't too big of a deal but i honestly wasn't trying to tip them that much (because of the slow service) so i feel like by not giving us our change they kinda robbed us of a couple bucks  we waited 10 minutes for them to bring us back the change but nothing  of course  i didn't leave a separate tip since part of the change was supposed to be their tip  who knows  maybe during less busy times they'll be more on top of their service 
when i'm not busy wanting to stuff my face with mac n' cheese  then i'm wanting to stuff my face with soup dumplings (or regular dumplings  once they're good!)  these doughy  bag like  morsels or joy are one of my favorite foods and i was introduced to this place after a yelp event in flushing where i got to stuff my face with korean fried chicken   mmmmm     chickennnnn   so ingrid s  anderson c   roger h  and i hopped on over after a yelp elite event and after we worked up an appetite after an unofficial yelp afterparty karaoke extravaganzaaaaaa! anderson ordered a yummy looking soupy soup  ingrid ordered their beef udon noodles (i tried them and thought they were pretty good!) and to share we ordered a scallion pancake  pork soup dumplings and pan fried pork buns the udon noodles were hearty and full of flavor  the scallion pancake definitely is high on my list of scallion pancakes every consumed  they were crispy  had a nice texture and weren't too greasy  the soup dumplings were really fantastic  the skin was nice and thin and once i bit a tiny hole in and went for it there was a party in my mouth the pan fried pork buns were larger than i thought they would be and they were really succulent and awesome  man  i wish i had 1 to eat right now  lol  i'm rarely out in this part of town because commuting here isn't exactly a joyful experience  however i would totally come back to gobble up more food here!*_________________________________________________* nan xiang dumpling house is a cash only establishment  so come prepared to shell out some paper  lucky for you  they're super cheap   yay!
not authentic food  not shanghai nan xiang xiao long too much soup in the dumpling the first sip is bland  then the after taste is too salty 
little round balls of pork  pork fat  and more pork fat  i would eat here every single day if i could do so without dying 
this place is open late and is known for their homemade dumplings  no cards are accepted  we wanted their homemade dumplings  but at 3pm they said they had no more  the place is big and the service was fast  but not very friendly (typical for asian restaurants) so we ordered the shu mai  crab meat dumpling and pan fried dumpling  the food was just alright  the crab dumpling was the highlight as the dumpling had soup inside  i never had that before  eating it was like a bit of wonton soup in one  the shu mai was a little different and was made with sweet rice  we didn't like that one at all  the pan fried dumpling was just like pot stickers  the meat did not fill the the entire dumpling dough so it was mediocre  it wasn't the best chinese place and i'm not sure what the rave is all about for this place  you can skip this on your list  you won't be missing anything 
i have been here 10+ times and half of those times  we've had to flag down a waiter  one time  the waiter forgot to give our order to the kitchen  the crab and pork soup dumplings are good  don't care much for anything else 
it was worth the drive from lga airport  roughly 20 minutes away  another china town! service is terrible as usual with great food selection  i would choose this over joe's! cash only! their crab xiao long bao is so fresh tasting even when it's a seafood choice  scallion pan cake is a bit of a let down  not as crispy or warm 
was hungry for some soup dumplings and wanted to grab a quick bite to eat  service is pretty fast  food are all priced pretty fairly  we went family styled and ordered a bunch of large dishes  plenty of seating inside 
i keep coming back to this dumpling house every month! this place obviously has the best soup dumplings  we ordered pork soup dumplings  all in its flavorful and juicy glory  since i'm a tripe lover  we also got the spicy beef and tripe  it's a cold dish  both spicy and sweet  if you can handle heavily fried food  the scallion pancake w  sliced beef is really good as well  it's fried to a crisp  but the pancake remains chewy and the beef remains fresh we came in during dinner time on sunday and were immediately seated  i've waited up to 20 minutes during lunch time before  but it's worth it  the small dishes range from $4~$7 (between 2 people  3 4 small dishes is pretty filling)  will definitely come back for some more 
i've been to joe's shanghai and their food has unfortunately slipped a lot in over the years  nan xiang easily beats them in terms of quality and price  i ordered the pork soup dumplings and scallion pancakes with beef  with just a touch of soy sauce and chili oil  i was in heaven  come here for authentic  delicious and affordable chinese food 
the food is excellent here   i highly recommend the salty soybean milk  fried scallion pancakes  and of course  steamed pork soup dumplings  these are all very tasty and satisfying  and i will plan to be back in the future    however  the service was subpar   one waitress spilled stuff multiple times  but later on the service was better 
it's not nice at all to force customers to pay tipslast time they forced me to pay $46 tips and the food was nasty
my favorite soup dumpling spot and is cash only btw! i always get their soup dumplings and scallion pancakes  my other favorite is the pan fried dumplings  the food is definitely worth the cheap prices! it can get pretty packed on the weekends and at night so there may be a wait outside sometimes  but usually there isn't a problem waiting for a table 
this is the best soup dumpling in nyc  don't agree? fight me if you come during brunch type hours  there may be a wait  otherwise  you're probably good to go  and soup dumplings are good any time  brunch dumpling bastards totally no frills  no f*cking around kinda joint  no extended menu  no large format dishes  just dumplings and a few standards  which are almost all spectacular you will get   pork and crab soup dumplings (called "buns" on the menu)   the thinnest skin of any soup dumplings i've ever had in nyc  full to near bursting with atomically heated soup  tastes just like your mother never made  that cold  cold woman  you will get two orders of this scallion pancake (preferably with beef)   this is not like any scallion pancake you've ever had  this is like some other ballpark sh*t  the only comparable experience with the dish i've ever had is at little pepper  which is much more dense and less flaky  kind of opposite sides of the scallion pancake spectrum  with this side on the "large and crispy" side  exemplary scallion noodle   nothing like your typical takeout noodle  fresh noodles  no peanut butter  minimal sauce  which is buried at the bottom and must be mixed in (if you don't  they will attempt to do it for you  which is delightful and did kind of make my friend want to learn how to say "i'm not an idiot  you know" in mandarin) these are must orders  and you are not to disobey me in getting them  if you don't  i'll know rice cakes are also a good order  and perfectly serviceable  but if you want to know the secret quarter mile dumpling morning evening brunch bastard  do this  soup dumplings at nanxiang  then hot oil wontons at white bear  then design your own at tianjin in the golden shopping mall see how nice life is when you just do what i say?
i'm super hungry and ready to feast like a tyrant ! this place is super inexpensive with great quality of food ready for your tummy  #clean #amazingstaff
we were all so happy that they expanded their space  more seating means less crazy out the door lines although that can still happen regardless  fast service and delicious food  fried dumplings  soup dumplings  scallion pancakes  noodles  fresh soy milk     seriously  it doesn't matter what you order  it's all awesomely delicious  you will leave here with a smile on your face and a full stomach 
i usually come here for their xiao long bao  fried eggs and chives  and their killer dumplings  their crab xiao long bao is out of this world  i actually prefer this place than the beloved joe shanghai  there's something mesmerizing about those little pocket of meats and soup wrapped in a thin steamed dough  best part  they're inconsistent with their food every damn time    probably why they're michelin rated  summary  come here for their dim sum and xiao long bao  if you're going to order any noodles and dishes ask them to go easy on the cooking oil  their a little heavy handed here 
i love this place! when i went to eat soup dumplings here  it was busy inside  when i was leaving  there was a line going outside! they have the best crispy and soft scallion pancakes in flushing and the best soup dumplings  i highly recommend this place 
my dad always cooked shanghai style food so i used to go to nan xiang all the time to remember that taste from my childhood  i would get soup dumplings  shanghai rice cakes  scallion pancakes  wonton soup (although i asked for it without all the seaweed in the broth) and some cold appetizers  and theeeennn   i stopped eating meat and so i stopped going to nan xiang because i was sad i wouldn't be able to get my favorite dishes   however  last week i caved in and went back  and i'm so glad i did because it turns out they have a bunch of on menu and off menu vegetarian options i didn't notice or know about before  so if you're vegetarian  vegan  scared of meat from unknown sources  or just looking for a great dish  here's my three favorites scalion pancakessoy peas  cabbage  and shredded bean curd (cold appetizer)rice cake with vegetable (not listed on menu  but just ask for it  it's awesome  i actually enjoy it more than the version i used to have with meat)they also have a whole bunch of vegetarian options i want to try in future visits  like the turnip puffs  vegetable noodle soup  steamed vegetable dumplings  pan fried noodles with vegetable  and crispy noodle with vegetable (ok these last two aren't listed on the menu  but if they have off menu rice cakes with vegetables they probably have these off menu as well)  so    ask for what you want  even if it's not written!
the terribly inconvenient location  lack of parking  inconsistent service  and scuzzy bathroom  are almost worth bearing for the sublime dumplings (both pan fried and soup dumplings)   the scallion pancake with sliced beef was greasy but also very crisp and tasty   you can't eat very much of it  but it's worth trying   the seafood crispy noodles were my least favorite dish  but man cannot live on dumpling alone   getting back to that bathroom   there wasn't a scrap of paper in there  tp or hand towel  now was there any hand soap   i lasted a waiter for toilet paper and was given a single paper napkin from one of ten dining tables   wth is up with that?  if the bathrooms are gross  the kitchen cleanliness is suspect   i wanted shanghai cuisine  not shanghai bathroom accommodations 
it's a great place regarding the flavor of the served foods  you may also adjust to your taste with some condiment on the tables  we have tried the pork dumplings  which they have to be made to order so they will arrive after other items ordered  be careful as they contain very hot juices inside  udon if you like noodles are a great choice  spicy beef and tripe (this is a cold dish) also great  scallion and beef pancake also another decent choice  this is a quick (after you're seated) in and out establishment  you patronize it for the food and the reasonably money paid  nothing fancy and your seat might be very close to the person next to you  not to mention the dishes ordered do not fit on the table  no interaction with the waiter personnel  they do not want to answer questions  they give one word answer if it's even the correct answer  they only want to know what are you about to order when a place is this busy (it open at 8 am and closes 16 hours later) they dictate how they run it  no need to greet and be sweet and    also not afraid to say  cash only
this place is amazing  the best and affordable soup dumpling restaurant in all of ny  better than the places in chinatown or the rest of flushing  besides the soup dumplings  the pan friend noodles  the beef noodle soup  and scallion pancakes are nice additions to the yummy soup dumplings  the price is also really cheap and all types of people love to eat here  the number of ratings and near 5 stars is really true because i have yet to find someone to dislike this place  parking will be difficult because of the large population and traffic in the heart of flushing but this place is always worth the trip
honestly  normal xiao long bao much better than ding tai fung  soup taste stronger than ding tai fung   strongly recommend if miss xiao long bao 
in nyc  speaking of soup dumplings  it eventually comes down to either nan xiang or joe's  unlike joe's  however  they are not just about soup dumplings  their other food are also good 
the food here is really authentic and i actually enjoy their small menu options  the xlb here is good but i wouldn't say it's the best  i would give this place 4 star but their customer service sucks and the workers acted like they didn't even want to help us take order or bring food out 
nan xiang is a very well known spot for soup dumplings  in queens  the place has very convenient hours with availability of a lot of the items even late night  i have to try and go during the day to compare but things are what i expected  the service is very prompt as was seating  they give you time to look at the menu because they know people will probably want something in addition to the xiao long bao  i was escorted to the other side of the eating area as were most of the late night customers  the dumplings were very good  this spot is great to go with your friends or if you want something to bring back home to eat later on 
this did not live up to all the hype behind it  i have given this two chances  and i will not be coming back here  the first time i came here  i got salty tofu soup  fried crullers  and the scallion pancakes with beef  the salty tofu soup was slightly curdled and had a very sour taste  the scallion pancakes with beef were extremely oily  after eating only one slice  i left with heartburn  the second time i came here  we ordered soup dumplings  fried gluten  rice cakes with beef  scallion pancakes  and the fried soup dumplings  everything was subpar  the fried gluten was the highlight of the meal  and there are definitely places with better food and fried gluten to go to  nan xiang is supposed to be famous for their soup dumplings  but i found myself wanting more flavor from them  the flushing food court down the road has much better soup dumplings than here  the rice cakes with beef didn't have too much flavor and the scallion pancakes were just as greasy as the first time i ordered them 
definitely a must when visiting flushing   been here a couple times so far and it never disappoints   be prepared to not be seated right away    good things come to those who wait!
nan xiang is a great place to grab soup dumplings now  its a definite go to place to introduce someone to this type of cuisine  it's nice that they make the soup dumplings right in front  the best thing to get there is the crab soup dumplings  i occasionally go there for taiwanese style breakfast  but its a bit too frustrating to come to flushing in the mornings 
been at nan xiang only two times  the first time i had the pork soup dumplings and the pork&crab soup dumplings  they were okay  nothing to rave about or go crazy over  just regular soup dumplings  the second time i was there  we never got our order  my friend and i placed a big order of soup dumplings  we waited for about 20 minutes which is kind of expected  right? soup dumplings need to be made and steamed on the spot  so we didn't mind waiting for some fresh soup dumplings  we eventually asked the waitress to know how much longer it would take because we were starving  she told us it would be coming soon  we waited for about another 20 minutes to eventually find out the order was never put in  maybe it was too busy? it would've been another 15 minute or so for them to get us our order  so we decided to leave  hopefully if i'm ever in the area again i will try them again  maybe the third time will be the charm  hopefully it will be enough for a much better rating 
amazing dumplings and udon noodles! the place looks like a hole in the wall but one of the most popular spots in queens  all the locals come here 
excellent shanghainese restaurant in flushing's chinatown  we have been here a few times but this first for brunch  it's always packed and has a line   even at 9 30 am!we ordered a bunch of food  everything was really good  i think this place is much better than the ones in manhattan chinatown  including joe shanghai  the soup dumplings are awesome  the spicy beef tripe was good    there are some interesting dishes that i haven't tried before  such as the scallion pancake wrapped meat pie  the wontons were yummy too no matter when you come just be prepared to wait  parking is a mess so be patient  it's also a trek to get here via train if you are coming in from manhattan  plan to do other stuff in the area to maximize your trip check out my pics of our brunch!
excellent dim sum and xiao long bao! the major tip i can give here is to come early and avoid the horrible wait given it's very popular  if possible  come at 11am if it's a sunday  the restaurant itself is rather large and although they have normal sized tables in the first room  they have a side room with long tables that can accommodate over 10 people  which is nice  oh  they also forget dishes if you don't remind them  so make sure to call to their attention certain dishes if there is a lag  or your xiaolongbao already came out  which usually takes the longest to prepare  1  kao fu  one of the better ones i've had  the spongy portion tasted fresh  and the mushrooms were good  it's on the sweeter side 2  xiaolongbao  better than joe's shanghai by far  it's probably among the best i've had in new york  it's still not as good as ding tai feng  but it's quite satisfying  get an order of the pork as well as the crab 3  beans and tofu  quite refreshing and delicious  it's a healthy portion that they serve  the beans are fresh  4  cold soy milk  people get the hot or salty soy milk  but with all the hot dishes  i need a cold drink  this hit the spot  i still dipped the fried dough into my cup  5  wood ear mushrooms  love this dish! it's nice and crunchy  if you've never had this  you may get put off by the texture though 6  pan fried pork dumplings  amazingly delicious  this is a must get here 7  scallion pancake  really well done  it's a slightly thicker version than what they serve at most places  but it'll be among the most flavorful you've had 8  fried dough  always a classic  this is not for everyone  in fact  i'm not sure non native chinese food eaters will likely this given it's greasy and really just dough  make sure to dip it in soy milk for the sweet combo 9 chive veggie dumplings  i'm not a huge fan of chives  but people ordered it  so i tried it  it's decent again  make sure you come early to avoid the hour long wait 
overrated  went here this morning with my dad  ordered the scallion pancake that everyone raves about  it arrived as an oily  greasy   spongy thing with no flavor and a sprinkle of scallion  we also ordered the pan fried pork buns  they looked delicious  however  this too had no flavor  it was mostly dough   and inside was a small ball of ground pork  unseasoned  yuck  do not waste your time here  unless you enjoy paying $15 for fried   salty dough 
obsessed with their crab and pork soup dumplings  pan fried dumplings  scallion pancake with beef  crispy noodles and cold appetizers (jelly fish isn't worth it)  service is hit or miss but i don't really care bc the food is so good 
always my favorite place for xiao long bao  i used to lived in upstate ny and always went here whenever i came down to nyc  and since i moved to ca  i always have to come here whenever i am back to the nyc  the crab xiao long bao is the best  really juicy and tasty 
my go to a few years ago used to be joe shang hai for soup dumplings but never again after some friends introduced me to this nearby spot! i usually don't enter places that seem overly cultured  so i always passed by this spot thinking it was some extremely asian food spot for family friends of the restaurant   but boy was i wrong soup dumplings  crispy noodles  soups  almost everything i had was always consistent and great on taste  very flavorful soup dumplings and can't forget to mention the quickness and price (very fair) actually because this place was so good  i was motivated to try the shops surrounding it and each one of them have a uniqueness to them  definitely recommended for family  friends from out of town  and just a hangout!
was very good  it better be or they wouldnt stay in business  had dinner here before i went to the rooftop lounge  solid meal for chinese food would definitely recommend
they have some vegan stuff here  the veggie dumplings are totally vegan  no eggs  they have veggie noodle soup  udon noodles you can ask to have no meat  and i really enjoyed their cold dish  cucumber with garlic  their scallion pancakes are pretty good  crispy and basic   )
the food is good   but they need to work on new systems   trying to get everyone to eat on the schedule is silly  if it is the only way to get the dumplings i then set up designated seating times  currently   if you happen to walk in and miss the seating time you are basically waiting outside until the next round even if they have empty tables   ridiculous 
arrived in chinatown wanted some crab dumplings   i called ahead for 2 orders to place an order for pick up   they told me 25 mins   i went there in exactly 25 mins they told me they did not receive my order   i showed them my recent calls on my phone   the rude hostess insisted she did not know who took the order   i am sure there are better places for dumplings in queens  definitely do not recommend 
so i have been coming for years since i'm in the neighborhood but tonight was just a shock  my husband is white  they sat us down and proceeded to ignore us  i motioned for someone to take our order three times  the sullen faced male walked away and didn't bother to take out a pad and proceeded to wait on customers who came in after us  he motioned for a female to write down the order  when the order finally arrived they put mine in front of my husband and vice versa  i asked the waiter to switch it around  he walked away so i had to lift two boiled bowls of noodles with my hands and burned my thumbs  i would note the place wasn't busy and we were the only mixed race couple in the place and all the waiters were rude to us  first thing tues we are marching to the human rights commission  sad in this day and age a restaurant in flushing would still do this to mixed race couples  no matter how good the food the service is unacceptable 
two thumbs up  my faves are the xiao long bao (can't beat 6 for $5 95) and the beef rolled in scallion pancake  also great  the beef tendon   the szechuan peppercorn is very prominent  we always come when we land or before we take off since flushing is so close to lga cash only 
this is the favorite breakfast place！the price is friendly，and the food are really chinese style！ xiao long bao is my first recommend！inside with pork meat，juice and delicious！higher recommend people who likes chinese food must try this place！
i would come back just for the dumplings and scallion pancakes  the soup was just okay  the broth was not anything crazy  but the beef was cooked perfectly  it just melted in my mouth  the soup dumpling were excellent  delicate  and very tasty  the scallion pancakes were also great  very crispy and not soggy at all  they had that great onion taste you expect from them  but they did not give us that scallion pancake sauce that they normally come with  nice find 
ok let's start with the fact that it took about 20 min for a waitress to pay attention to us and when she did she was pretty rude  then after we ordered someone was cleaning the bathrooms and the entire restaurant smelled like bleach  gross  the food came pretty quick  we got the soup dumplings which were ok  they stick to the roof of your mouth so be careful  then we got the dumplings in peanut sauce which were also ok i think i liked them better than the soup dumplings  we got the beef scallion pancakes which were good and came with a delicious plum sauce but it was so oily that i didn't feel good about myself after  we also got the udon noodles with beef which was nothing special  the noodles were thick and dry and there was barely any beef which we had to pay extra for  this place really didn't impress me and i prob won't be back 
cheap shanghainese food  great xl soup dumpling  soy milk  and green onion pancake  cold chicken is great too  but don't expect any service 
the short  good prices (most dishes below $10)  my go to place for xiao long bao  soup noodles are inconsistent  garlic cucumbers are good  quick service and lines move fast the long i've been her a number of times with friends and family   the xiao long bao are always consistent and my favorite part of the meal   always fresh and juicy  with a little thicker skin (compared to din tai fung) but i almost like better since they are less likely to pop    i would go to this place over joe's shanghai (less of wait and i think the xiao long bao taste better ) the soup noodles are inconsistent   sometimes the soups are bland such as the beef with pepper soup noodle and pork chop soup noodle   the sides are good  i usually get the green onion pancake and garlic cucumbers (my favorite)   shanghai stir fried noodle is good as well  the service is also inconsistent   sometimes they bring you double of an order (if you're lucky) or sometimes they will forget something   just depends on how busy they are   but then again  it is a chinese restaurant  so what do you expect? overall  good food (maybe stay away from some of the soup noodles) at a good price 
great xiao long bao! the noodles are ok  but the pancake with the beef is delicious! parking suks though 
my favorite xiao long bao place in flushing ^_^ definitely like it more than joe's because it's less oily and the skin is thicker doughier i usually also get the fried udon   good but nothing special if you've never had shanghainese breakfast before  i definitely recommend trying it out!i get the salty soybean milk (warm soybean milk with salty pickled greens  fried dough  fried shrimp  etc     very flavorful and my favorite shanghainese breakfast option!)  scallion pancake with sliced beef  & salty riceroll (pork floss (rousong)  fried dough  salty pickled greens rolled into rice)  i prefer the salty options over the sweet options because the salty options have a lot more going on (sweet soybean milk is just sweetened soybean milk with no toppings or anything  sweet riceroll is just fried dough  sugar) 
screw joe's shanghai  nan xiang beats joe's by like  an infinity  when i think  "omg  i need soup dumplings in my bell ay! " i immediately go  "nan xiang  all the way " i remember my first time here with my family and us waiting on this long ass line out the door  eating too quickly and disregarding the idea of 'delayed gratification'  my tongue burned on savory dumpling broth  i just kept on eating though because it was just that good  every time i arrive here  i order crab and pork soup dumplings as well as pork and cabbage noodle soup  the dumplings are  of course  plump and on the verge of exploding with juicy broth  their soup is like the traditional ones my mother makes  so naturally i feel right at home when i take my first sip  this broth is generously loaded with scallions and tender chunks of pork  bit ly 1bllo7s bit ly 1yxqkngthe last time i went here though  my bestie and i also ordered their scallion bbq beef pancakes on a whim  whoa  these are sinfully good  the best way i can describe them is   moist and tender pieces of beef wrapped in crispy yet soft scallion pancakes  if you ever order from this dumpling house  these are a must have!! come here with your friends and your family because everyone will be satisfied (by those crab&pork soup dumplings)  i promise 
nan xiang is probably one of the most famous names in soup dumplings in china   i'm not sure if this particular location is related to those locations based on the name  but overall it's likely the best place for soup dumplings in the north east   i personally prefer the crab meat soup dumplings and it's about all that i order   i believe that it is cash only  so be prepared with cash in hand   save yourself the headache of finding street parking and park at the city parking lot  it doesn't cost much and its a relatively quick walk over! i've also sampled some of their other dishes when i had a muslim friend with me who couldn't eat pork   i would basically not recommend much on the menu that isn't a soup dumpling   basically walk in with a wad of cash  order dumplings  preferably crab meat   don't bother ordering other stuff   eat dumplings when they come out   simple as that 
not gonna lying  the noodles taste like shit and the workers there are sucks  you have to pay tips even tho they're ignore you on purpose i would not go back even again 
this place has horrible service  every time you ask them for something they give you an attitude  we asked one of the waitress to put in an order for us and she didn't even acknowledge us and continue to scroll through her phone  i only came here for the soup dumplings but this will be my last trip 
very authentic  delicious chinese food at an incredible price  you're able to order a few varied things from the menu and leave feeling full and satisfied at a modest cost  very convenient location near public transportation 
average food  below average service  food took a long time to come  no ice and cold drinks are lukewarm  was disappointed  never coming back to this restaurant 
didn't understand the hype and the long wait  the soup dumplings were very gamey and other dishes were way too salty 
my go to spot for great soup dumplings  i always get both the pork and the pork crab meat dumplings and man are they the bomb  the dough is soft and chewy and the fillings are so tasty and savory other really notable dishes   beef scallion pan cake  tender beef  wrapped in a crispy scallion pancake   rice cake with pork   shanghai pan fried udon  chicken with wine saucethey have a good breakfast selection as well with their hot cold soy bean milk and congee  there's a lot of seating here but the down side is that they only accept cash  food comes out very quickly and they're opened late so give this place a try! i highly recommend it 
2 stars only because the food is still the best  but be prepared for the worst customer service of your life  i've been going to this place for years  and i've seen the employees bring this establishment to the ground  go to shanghai you garden instead! you get an order of free soup dumplings  if you order more than $10 
literally the best soup dumplings that money can buy there is no better place that i have ever been prices are fair and food is always delicious have never had a bad thing on there menu and have never had to send anything back great place to go with friends and family
this place has amazing xiao long bao! we were researching places to get xlb in new york and all our sources pointed to this place as the place to go  the xlb's were cheap but very big (unlike din tai fung)  unlike some places that i've been to  the wrap itself was thin so you most tastes the soup and stuffing  i wasn't a fan of the crispy noodles and the shiao mai but i think i came to an understanding that i don't really like shiao mai anyway  
great dim sum place  reasonable price outstanding taste  it was beyond my expectation  even though ordering food was hard bcs of language barrier but i forgot about it after the meal served 
there are so many reviews on this place  so there isn't a whole lot more i could add here   it's a pretty good place  but nothing to go crazy about   of course come for the soup dumplings   everything was just okay 
absolutely love this place have been a customer here for years and have never left disappointed!always  always  always  get the pork soup dumplings!can't wait till winter!
tried to eat at joe's shanghai twice this weekend but the line was about "45 mins" (which is really chinese code for "there is no discernible way to ever know i you'll ever be seated")  came out to flushing and would highly  highly recommend this place (not that it needs any more reviews)  bomb xlb and steamed pork buns and scallion pancake wrapped beef (literally translated as "beef rolled up pancake") service was solid (which is much more than you can ask from 99% of asian restaurants)  super positive experience that will make the trek out to flushing not seem awful 
the xiao long boa is super juicy  the pork alone is better than the one combined with crab  they don't put enough in but for a small hint of crab flavor  the pork by itself is more flavorful  the scallion pancakes were great  the pan fried pork boa was too doughy for my taste  it overpowered the meat inside  definitely coming back  it's worth the long ride
for the price you get 6 xlb and it is really delish!! the wait is a bit long but hey   they have to make it fresh! also i do enjoy ordering their udon stir fry noodles   greasy but delish!!expect a wait when you go later during the day or on the weekend   cozy restaurant with great food   what would you expect?
i actually don't know why this place is so popular  i mean yeah they have decent dumplings and your typical chinese dim sum varieties but that's kind of it  the wait wasn't as long as i thought it would be  we were seated right away  but the hostess up front that gave us our card number really made me want to not eat there  lol  she just thew me the card and that was that  but anyway    in terms of size it's quite small but can fit a handful of people  the food came out quick as well  pan fried udon was pretty solid  the beef and chili pepper noodle soup was not spicy at all though  i liked the noodles that i believe they make themselves  but it was a pretty boring dish  the scallion pancake was not bad though  pretty decent food here and there but nothing i'd rave about  maybe it was just a bad day? the soup dumplings has really weird tasting meat  i've tried much better  bottom line is  i probably won't come back  but some stuff here really are good though  maybe we just chose the wrong stuff 
nan xiang is one of the best places for soup dumplings  the waiters are a little eh but its a fast pace restaurant so they might not always be so attentive  scallion pancakes and their crispy noodles are also top notch 
i found this place through yelp  i went for a quick dinner with my son on the way to laguardia  really cool place  decor is nothing fancy  but the food was very good  reminded me of all the flavors i enjoy when i travel to hong kong  will def be going back!
i heard about this place from online  where everyone seemed to have something good to say  so i definitely arrived with some very high expectations  friends that had been before told me the scallion pancakes were a must order as well as the namesake xiao long baos or soup dumplings  the wait time is the first complaint i have  a few friends and i arrived at around 12  with plans for a quick light lunch  were weren't seated until 1  which is absolutely absurd  i dont think an hour wait time should be justifiable for any joint no matter how tasty the food  we were seated immediately however and after ordering  the food came out promptly  overall  the food didn't quite live up to the hype that was built around it  dont get me wrong  it was definitely tasty  however i was definitely expecting a little more  especially considering the hour wait time  might come back here again if i'm in the area 
i thought first was not going to eat anything in flushing after the elite event but since we basically ate desserts first and not a real meal  it was time for food  there were three separate section to this restaurant   some other yelpers got here earlier but my party of three came here just ready to eat  the choices we made i think were great decisions the food ordered was pan fried dumplings  (6)  and it came with just the right crisp on the skin  shanghai shao mai which was really good even though i didn't really know what it was  the other choices were steamed pork bun and shanghai pan fried u don  actually loved everything   pan fried u don came with bakchoy  and that might have been my favorite  i recommend the place and hope to get back soon  reasons to come here are so many  hopefully get a nice table   maybe get there early 
best soup dumpling place  i believe this place is better than joes shanghai in their flushing and chinatown location  i always get the steamed pork puns  crispy seafood noodles  and the scallion pancakes with sliced beef  you must try all 3  it's always my go to when coming here  i've also tried the pork buns once which were also delicious  the foods always perfect  best comfort food  and flavorful  i think they have the best pork soup dumplings compared to joes because the dumpling skin isn't too thin and doesn't pop so easily and the flavor in general is better tasting to me  the service here is quick and efficient  if you're coming here on a weekend  expect a wait because the place gets packed  the first place to pop into my head if i'm craving soup dumplings ( 
excellent as usual   service is super fast  food is cheap and outstanding  will definitely be back 
my go to place on quickie xlb's and karfu if i'm not near little neck; otherwise  i go to little dumpling 
normally this place is a 5 5 for its xiao long baos  it has the best baos in flushing  here's why this place lost 4 stars the service here is always a hit or miss  sometimes they are on top of their shit and gets us our food within 10 minutes  however  that wasn't the case today  we ordered beef noodles and that came relatively quick (within 5 minutes of ordering)  buttt the xiao long baos took over 40 minutes (i know this because i was able to collect from the pokestop 8 times)  granted that today is labor day and it's pretty packed  that is no excuse for slacking off and forgetting about a customer  in addition  when asked where our food was and why customers that came later than us received their food first  the waiter replied with a snarky remark  "sorry it is taking so long  you can either wait quietly for your food  or leave " sigh  all i wanted was some good xiao long baos    
i haven't such a good and well priced food in a while  the food is really oily but still so good  particularly loved the udon noodles 
my boyfriend and i ordered the beef & tripe along with a pork and crabmeat xiao long bao  the service was "meh" compared to other restaurants in the area  the servers just came  took your order  served your food  and you wouldn't see them again until the bill  the food was also "okay" (i've had better)  i would save my money and go to the ones in the manhattan chinatown 
where most people go to the infamous joe's    this place is comparable  especially it is much more convenient to get a seat since chinatown is in the city and parking is hard to find  started off with an edamame  dry hot chilli  tofu medley which was quite spicy  followed by a sesame oil  cilantro  cucumber slaw and kimchi tofu  the place is decent sized and the staff was nice  the decor is nothing to brag about honestly but that is not something expect from a chinese spot in ny    you should expect great food! the soup dumplings were definitely delicious  i did find that broth might be a little heavier than joe's (i noticed visible clumps of pork fat)    but that definitely added to the "soup" taste i was looking for i tried the pork but the crabmeat was amazing! i would also suggest the chopped veggies as well    it definitely helped cleanse the palette in between the heavier pork and crabmeat if you're looking for some dumplings and want to compare it to joe's reign    give this place a shot fairly priced as well!!!!
best xiao long bao in my opinion  the skin is thicker compared to others i've had  like joe's shanghai  but i actually prefer it that way  the filling is very tasty and there's enough soup to fill your spoon  i find that their quality is very consistent they also have a really crispy scallion pancakes that are cut up into triangles  their fried rice cakes are pretty good too  the sauce is thick and makes the cakes sticky in a good way  the only issue is that it ends up making my mouth sticky too the only gripe i have with this place is that they only have two single bathrooms and they can get quite busy so if you need your tea refilled  you gotta ask also they are cash only 
after watching eddie huang's video about this place  i knew i had to go and never return to joe's shanghai  met up a friend in flushing and we went here around 3 45pm for a late lunch early dinner  there was no wait but an hour later there were lines forming  they give out hot tea during the winter so that's a plus! we ordered pork soup dumplings  shanghai pan fried udon noodles  and scallion pancake with sliced beef  the soup dumplings are waaaay better here than at joe's hands down  the flavor is more prevalent  the pan fried udon noodles were okay  i could easily pass up on it next time  but their scallion pancake with sliced beef was super delicious  the beef inside was flavorful and tender  went so well with the crispy pancake  10 10 would go again! also  cash only!
excellent food  highly recommend soup dumpling  pan fried udon and scallion pancake with beef  i've never waited for service here  and is some of the best food i've had in flushing  less overwhelming than the food courts  and a little less crowded than joe's shanghai 
my boyfriend and i went in during lunch time on a saturday  it was pretty busy  but we still got a table  they served us hot tea right away  and we ordered the pork and the crab xiao long bao (soup dumplings)  rice cake with shredded chicken  and scallion pancake with sliced beef  everything here is delicious and authentic  have you seen those ladies in the dumpling hut?!!!! they aint messin' around!!!! the soup dumplings have a nice thin skin  the flavor of the filling is very balanced  and the broth is very light and flavorful  caution  the broth is scorching hot   so give it a vinegar bath!! "don't be a hooligan!"  eddie "clown ninja" huang (vice)the scallion pancake has a crispy outside and is filled with sliced beef shank  there is a hint of sweetness from the hoisin sauce  if i could eat these everyday i would  **** cash only ****pros  the food  authentic  food comes out quick and hotcons  wait staff expects ordering fast (just say if you need more time)overall  all the food is fantastic! the soup dumplings should make any best of new york list 
soup dumplings  very good   no ice for drinks on 90+ degree daycold beef  pig intestines plate had raw beef on bottom  couldn't replace  didn't get to finish got a cold tofu dish   okservice terrible  no manners  tea and water  dropped on the table and walks away!tough to get waitress' attention scallion pancakes  very good  crispy  fresh  filling  tasty  and big portions service sucks  food is good  parking is a nightmare@
always bring my non asia friends here! great food  with many vegetarian options as well if you can't eat the traditional soup dumplings! also price is great!
soup dumplings are excellent  just as good if not better than joe's shanghai   the edamame and pickled vegetable appetizer was perfect balance of salty  crunchy  sweet  and refreshing 
honestly not bad  food is good  service pretty fast for a tiny restaurant  honestly i would recommend this for families  it's quiet cheap as well 
not sure what to think  came here on a rainy wednesday night and was excited because i thought "great  it won't be crowded  they might take their time with the food"  the food was good but i don't know!!! maybe because of all the hype i expected more?we got scallion pancake  2 orders of soup dumplings  one pork  one crab and pork and the shanghai udon noodles  soup dumplings  flavor was good (def skip plain pork and go straight to crab variety) but many stuck together and broke even as we ohhhh so gently picked them up  very sad  ( the skin wasn't that thin that they should be breaking scallion pancake  delish  not too oily but could use more scallion flavor  dipped in chili oil and chilies it was good noodles  boyfriend loved these  the noodles were good and tender with nice bok choy mixed in (although would have liked more vegetables)  they also came with meat when we asked for only vegetables but that wasn't a big deal  not too saucy  a little hint of spice  was good  everything was good  just not worth the hype  which isn't their fault??? i don't know!!
i feel like with every time i come here  my review drops half a star  which is really unfortunate  i will attest to the fact that i will take nan xiang's soup dumplings over joe's shanghai any day  but can we do something about the random bits of crab shell that i have to keep picking out??the broth is much thinner and clearer here and i like that the skin is not too thick  maybe next time i'll have just the pork dumplings instead of the combo crab and pork to avoid any possibility of shells and have a better experience   (
the place was busy and line was all the way out the door   make sure to go inside and grab a ticket first if you see that when you are there   the wait definitely was worth it in my option   it was first time been there and the food was great   i ordered their signature xiao long bao (steam pork bun) obviously   it was not the style i like but it was good   (this is the one with the wonton looking skin)  my wife ordered a beef chowmein by mistake (thinking it a noodle soup type)  but she end up loving it   i forgot what other small dish appetizer i got but it all end up well   i totally will revisit this place again when i get the chance 
this is a great place for soup dumplings if you want a change from joe's shanghai  unfortunately it still does have lines like joe's  but i think it's less popular and not as much of a tourist attraction   so worth checking out if you don't want to wait as long scallions pancakes were great  can taste the scallions and not super doughy   crispy and somewhat oily  worked really well with the dip  pork soup dumplings  i think these are on par with joe's  they are a suitable alternative   as always don't burn your tongue on the soup  as its deceivingly hot!pork buns   did not like these  overdose of flour and way little meat   don't recommend  prices weren't too bad here  but they definitely do not try to price competitively  feels like there's a standard as to how much soup dumplings cost  around $6 7 for one basket of 6  all the establishment gotta be making a pretty high profit margin on this dish!really wish they would bring ding tai feng over to ny because that is definitely several levels of taste and quality above any soup dumpling i've had in ny   they did a small pop up in flushing's sheraton about 15 years ago  and to this day i've never figured out why it didn't catch on 
one of my favorite for soup dumplings!  and i've been to dozens in search of the best  authentic and unpretentious  also love their seafood crispy noodle  just the right texture and flavor  service is so so  some of these people seem fresh off the boat and still have to learn to smile (or look our way in case we need more stuff)  but that's what makes it authentic  it's a no frills delicious place  taste more than compensates for lackluster service 
i love this place because it's walkable from the 7 train  there's never any wait for a table when i go on weekend mornings  i would say their customer service is lacking since all they care about is getting more people through the door and into a seat  i can't help but feel like i'm eating too slow or stressed  other than that  their food is great  and that's what my stars always reflect  the quality is definitely still there (let's hope they don't turn into a tourist location   ) i'm confident to say i've tried all the compared restaurants in the area and they have the best scallion with beef pancake!! hands down! their soup dumplings are really good too  the soup in the dumpling isn't too salty or oily i also like the beef noodle soup  there are many other dishes but these the third i always get again and again  happy eating!!
after reading about how popular nan xiang xiao long bao is  i knew i had to try it when i was visiting flushing  we came on a saturday afternoon (around 12 30 pm) and it was packed  we waited about 35 minutes before we got seated  the soup dumplings were amazing! i never had soup dumplings with that much soup  so juicy and tasty  i thought the pork soup dumplings were better than the crab and pork soup dumplings  we also had beef scallions which was so crunchy and flavorful  the reason i can't give this restaurant 5 stars is the service and the lack of comfort while dining  overall rude service  my server seemed so angry at us for ordering   it was strange  when my husband was waiting in line  a server walked by with a bowl of soup and she rudely said to him in chinese "be careful!!" also  there is such a long line that there are people hovering over your table as you eat  it is super uncomfortable but it was definitely worth trying their soup dumplings 
i visited on a monday around 12 30pm  fortunately there wasn't a lunch crowd so i was seated promptly  the order was taken quickly  however the wait time for the food was easily a solid 25 minutes  this is understandable since they were making the dumplings fresh i ordered the pork and crab dumplings   they were delicious and succulent   succulent    this word doesn't get much usage these days  it's a shame because it almost sounds dirty  "how was your shower dear?"     "it was succulent!""how does this dress make me look?"        "succulent!""c'mon man!!! give me the goods!!!  i need  i need  i need!!!!!  i'll succulent the lead out of your pencil !!!"yeah so anyways  the dumplings were quite delicious or succulent   be sure to place them in the provided spoon and eat them from there to capture the juices when you bite into that succulent sucka   vinegar soy sauce over the top and you're good to go prices are pretty reasonable it comes out to about a buck a dumpling   now make like a leaf and tree!
their soup dumplings are filled with juicy delicious soup in each one  my favorite is the crab soup dumplings! superb!
great price! their soup dumplings are really good  not the most responsive waiters but i'll take it 
the rice cakes are just so so but the crab soup buns are so delicious  went there for early dinner  only if i can get up early i'll definitely eat there fore breakfast as well  great price point  recommend
overall  a decent spot for shanghainese food  my friend and i came here for breakfast and share the savory tofu pudding  hot soy milk  sheng jian bao (pan fried soup dumplings)  xiao long bao  and spicy wontons  the food was good  but it wasn't the best i've ever had  the skins on both the sheng jian and xiao long bao were a little too thick for my liking  if you're in the area and like shanghainese food  nan xiang is worth checking out  but i don't think it's anything to rave about 
this place has a delicious variety of dumplings  during the three times i've been here  the waitresses and waiter were friendly to me  i would recommend to those who are having trouble choosing a decent place to eat in flushing that cooks xiao long bao and other choices of dim sum 
my ultimate favorite xlb (xiao long bao) place   this place is literally my first stop when i'm back home!! food i always order 2 pork soup dumplings and the beef scallion pancakes and this is enough for 2 people!  the soup dumplings have a nice skin that isn't too thick and theyre always served freaking fresh! so let it cool a little or just go ahead and slurp the burning soup at your own risk    the beef scallion pancakes have a strong taste and theyre on the greasy  savory sweet side so if youre going with a korean mom picky eater stick to the simple scallion pancakes!service   service is average   the lady at reception can be quite rude at times  especially during busy hours but ive learned to just sort of ignore it haha   it seems less rude when you know in advance  regarding the waiters  theyre def  better but none really stand out  they also  need to be called at to get any service  ambience   not really a romantic spot but not as loud as some other restaurants   no music playing obnoxiously or drunk people (even though they do serve alcohol! i usually come here to catch up with friends feed my addiction to their xlb  haha tldr   come here  service ambience isnt so great but the food is 10 10   order pork soup dumplings + beef scallion pancakes(+) = cheap (less than 10)  delicious  good for small medium groups( ) = avg  service  cash only  10 15 min  wait during busy hours
great late night option for good food   noodles  soup  dumplings are all good   only thing i didn't care for was the beef scallion pancake as it was too greasy and loaded with hoisin sauce so it was all i could taste 
i used to think this place was the best for xiao long bao since there are always long waits  after sampling some other restaurants in chinatown  their  baos are really sub par  the wrap is thick and doughy  so you cant just pop one in your mouth and let the soup explode  instead you have to take it in two bites so it just feels like eating buns  the shanghai noodles are also very greasy   however  they do have a complete variety of appetizers that others lack so i give them that  but as far as xiao long baos go  im sticking to others 
excellent food   obviously  their xlb (soup dumplings) is really good   we always get the pork and crab ones   their pan fried noodles is also a must   and it is so cost effective (e g   inexpensive) but soooo good   i personally preferred it to joe's shanghai a few blocks away cons  (1) parking is a nightmare   tip  park at the municipal lot 2 blocks towards union st   and don't bother trying to street park  (2) there's usually a line regardless of time of day  but it moves pretty quickly
i love this place  i can't even count the number of times i have been here within the last 6 months and it still never fails  i always get their soup dumplings  which is around $6 for 6 of them  which comes in a steamer  they are to die for  i've been to joe's shanghai and i definitely prefer nan xiang's over to theirs  the skin is not too thick and the perfect consistency and the soup is just incredible  two of these usually fill me up a lot  i also really like getting their soymilk  which they make in house  for vegetarians  they have steamed vegetarian dumplings that are packed filled with veggies on the inside  they also have fried gluten  which comes as a side dish  you can ask for any of their pan fried noodles to be made san meat and make sure you ask for a vegetarian broth for the vegetarian noodle soup! my bf also really likes their scallion pancakes  and if you want rice rolls  you can ask them to make it san meat  it's a very casual place  so don't expect your usual restaurant service  they are here to take your order  refill your tea and deliver your food to you! but the servers are really friendly and even now recognize me because i go so often  they always greet us  refill our teas and take care of us well! i highly recommend coming here!!
very tasty and a frequent favorite stop  the only reason i deducted a star is sometimes it takes a while to get seated and a few times they seem to forget i am there  but try them out  and get teh wontons in spuicy sacue  or the soup dumplings  you'll thank me!
their food prices are super good and the food never disappoints  cash onlycommunication can be a bit of problem sometimes * xiao long bao   steamed pork and soup broth was perfect combination with soy sauce* scallion pancake   super crispy and chewy enough* beef and chili pepper noodle soup   soup was pretty enough spicy but little salty * pan fried dumpling   loved thickness of fried dough but little greasy and hard to chew* iced soy milk    my favorite one in this store
overrated  been here twice  both times food was just average   if that  and service unbearably slow   go to shanghai you garden if looking for good shanghai food with fast service   there's a wait but at least there are places nearby to walk to while you wait 
not impressed  i don't understand the hype for this restaurant service is terrible  it's almost impossible to get the attention of the staff working here  our main reason to come here was to try the dumplings  and they forgot to bring us that dish (we had ordered a total of 4 dishes)  i didn't care for anything else  except for the scallion pancakes   the pan fried beef udon only had a few pieces of beef in it 
nan xiang has been my go to place for whenever i crave soup dumplings  their warm and savory broth is well presented with delicious filling and a delicate  yet sturdy  skin  the price of the soup dumplings is very affordable and definitely worth (if not an amazing deal) the quality of their food  when you're there  don't only order soup dumplings!! as renown as theirs are  the other food on their menu is also authentic and delicious 
i have been going to this establishment for years and the food is always consistent  i have tried soup dumplings from other places (yes  including joe's shanghai) and none compares to the dumplings made here  when i eat a soup dumpling i expect a thin but chewy skin  savory broth and tender  seasoned meat  this place excels in all areas and the prices are cheap  do not bother going to manhattan for some overrated  hyped up subpar food  if you want good chinese food  then go the places where chinese people live and eat themselves  the menu has both english and chinese so don't feel uncomfortable or shy that you just stepped into the chinatown of ny  i suggest going any weekday because it gets packed on weekends  although they are usually quite busy  i suggest literally everything on the menu  their soup dumplings are the best but their other selections are just as good  i highly recommend pork soup dumplingpan fried udonscallion pancakesspicy beef  tripe and some mysterious jelly thingsoy milkpanfried dumplingthe food is quite greasy but the chinese cuisine is naturally quite greasy like indian food so i suggest gulping down that grease with the hot tea they provide    or you could just wait and get boba from one of the ubiquitous bubble tea shops in flushing  p s  it would be a crime to not put that vinegar & ginger with every bite of each dumpling  happy slurping  )
came here on friday around 6 pm and my table of 9 was seated immediately  the menu isn't huge but a decent size so we ordered a bunch of things to share  the food was good but nothing spectacular  some things were a hit or miss  i broke down my review of every item so it is easier to read 1  steamed pork soup dumplingsi like that the bun was thin and a decent amount of broth and pork inside  the flavor was good  one of my favorites of what we ordered 2  steamed pork and crab soup dumplingsi did not try this but my cousin preferred the pork 3  beef and chili pepper noodle soupif you ever had beef and long horn peppers as a dish  this is the same thing but in soup and noodle form  broth was good but a bit oily  the noodles were small and thin  like egg noodles but not yellow  reminded me of ramen from ippudo 4  shanghai pan fried udonjust noodles with some veggies in it  flavor was lacking  a tad oily  udon was doughy and not in a good way  very heavy 5  rice cake with shredded pork and pickled veggiesrice cakes were small and needed more cooking time  there was barely any pork in it  veggies could have been more pickled  this had a lot of room for improvement 6  scallion pancake with sliced beefthis was probably my favorite  the sliced beef was something different  this was a bit salty though 7  pan fried dumplingstook some time to come out but good  i wish they had made it brown on both sides not just one  doughy in a good way and meat inside was pretty good 8  shanghai shao maithis one was weird  looked like a shu mai but then inside was rice! like a sticky rice  not much flavor  wouldn't order this again 9  crispy noodle with pork and mushroomsthis was just whatever to me  the noodles were crispy but the dish was bland 10  sweet soy bean milkthis came in a huge bowl with a straw  my friend really enjoyed this service  quick to sit  took a while to take our order  food came out pretty quick except the pan fried dumplings which we checked on and then they told us those take a while  we asked for refill of tea and water but they only refilled our waters  so so overall  really depends on who is working there i would probably never come back here   
the service is meh  but the food is on par  the soup dumplings are always on point  the beef scallion pancakes could use more beef slices  the pancakes are super doughy and thick with only 1 tiny slice of beef  the proportions are way off  4 stars for the price of the food !
i love their pan fried pork buns and their soup buns  it's delicious! i can even eat it without the vinegar soy sauce my boyfriend and i go to this place often   because it is our go to shanghai place  places like joe's shanghai is a bit overrated anyway anyway  we get seated pretty quickly and this place can get packed  their cold cucumber appetizer is refreshing and it's always a great starter   we then would get the buns and soup dumplings which are warm and delicious in my mouth  we sometimes get their noodles and the spice is on   especially if you eat the peppers  what's best is that we get several dishes and it's very affordable the caveat is that sometimes  we get seated in such small tables that our dishes barely fits  d=
these were ok  not great  actually somewhat disappointed  the xlb definitely had nice soup with quite a bit of gelatin  you could feel it  on your lips  but they weren't as flavorful  the fried buns were bland and dry and the scallion pancakes were just fry bread with no flavor and barely any scallions at all  cmon   how cheap are scallions to put some in there? it's in the name for goodness sake!
my friend and i were looking for a chinese restaurant after coming back exhausted from niagara fall and this place was everything that we looked for  everything was delicious and no body spoke english so we could tell the place was very authentic  we were sad that we found this place out so late  but we will definitely be back when we back in new york
mmmm  soup dumplings    this is my go to place for soup dumplings  they make it really well here and each order comes with 6 dumplings  the dumplings use to come with the lettuce on the bottom but i think they realized that no one eats that so they just leave it out; no complaints  the next best item in this restaurant is the scallion beef pancakes  they're sorta oily but pretty bomb at the same time  the stir fried udon noodle rice cake noodles are average  pretty much just a carb filler for the soup dumplings lol  service is also average  basically come here for the food anywayoverall  pretty good  get the dumplings and the pancake and you'll know what i mean!
taste  i love the xiao long bao its so juicy and explodes in your mouth  sometimes i don't get all the soup but most of the time i do  dip it and in the sauce but dont drown it   it is def a go to for xlb  service  i waited like 15 minute for it and it was for take out  it was on a super cold day too and ppl were still willing to wait for xlb!! price  it's very cheap for the taste  esp if you go as a group and share the xlb  pancakes  egg fat noodles  etc   we got all of that 2 winters ago and only paid 10$   and left with super satisfied stomaches and taste buds  ambiance  its so busy and they have 2 rooms  if you want to go as a big group don't go during peak times 
so this  this is where my favorite xiao long bao is! the skin is well put together and the soup  while not as fatty  is a bit cleaner  the crab and pork combo is the way to go  some folks i have read call this a tourist trap and honestly  so it joe's (lets be real folks  they draw crowds equally)  but there is a good reason for the wait  they output some solid food and they manage to be consistent which is a struggle most popular places can suffer from 
great authentic food;  if you want to try dumplings each way they could be made this is a rest local spot little long of a wait; and not a lotof follow up service during meal   but worth it for the soup dumplings
this place is always packed and rightfully so  the wait wasn't too bad  maybe 10 minutes at max? first thing that i noticed when i was being seated  the waitress had a terrible attitude  she quite literally slammed our plates down onto the table and flung the forks alongside with it  my friend and i eyed each other but we decided not to pay much mind to it  however  the men sitting at the table next to us asked the lady for some soy sauce and she proceeded to grab the vinegar off our table and said "you eat soup dumplings with vinegar  not soy sauce " for starters  she should've just given him the soy sauce he had wanted  maybe he preferred soy sauce over vinegar  am i not correct? secondly  i found it mind boggling how she decided to give the man our vinegar    i guess she assumed we didn't need vinegar so it was probably the smartest move to take our vinegar rather than going back and grabbing another bottle  negativity aside  the food was amazing  i was sick so i didn't have the biggest appetite but we ended up ordering (from best to eh)  a  scallion pancakes with sliced beef      despite it being a tad on the oilier side  it was absolutely delicious  with a nice crunchy outside  the first bite instantly sends you to heaven  the beef is nice and tender  topped off with a mouth watering oyster sauce  would definitely recommend! b  steamed pork buns      hands down  best soup dumpling i've had  the dough is nice and thin but doesn't tear easily like most soup dumplings and once the soup hits your tastes buds  it's over  c  steamed crab & pork buns      i wasn't a big fan of the yellow coloring and it had a strange smell to it as well  the soup is great  as per usual  but i'd probably just stick to the steamed pork buns 
cash only! sit down kind of place  takes about 10 15 minutes to get a table if you're with a big group (mine was 7)  if possible  go with a chinese companion so you don't have to worry about ordering the right things  leave that to them  scallion pancakes with beef   my favorite thing of everything we tried gluten (straight up gluten)   interesting experience  chewy  tasted like steak that had already been chewed  pork soup dumplings   didn't try  crab soup dumplings   super hot once you bite into it but then it's great  rice cake with seafood   wish it had more pieces of seafood  the rice cakes were addictive  some warm milky soup   i tried this and didn't care for it  it tasted like bland breast milk to me  chinese churros (that you apparently dip into the warm milky soup)   meh not bad  plain carby snack  veal and tripe   pretty good  i was into it  tofu covered with some red sauce   we liked it all around  overall  the food is pretty oily but tasty  service was lightning fast  seems like a flushing staple that i'm glad i got the chance to explore!
this is my favorite place to get soup dumplings  pork and crab combo are the best! shanghai pan fried u don is the second reason i come here 
i love their soup dumplings! when you eat in  it comes out relatively quick  but when you takeout food it always takes quite awhile and they sometimes may forget  but overall  a good place to get some nice warm soup dumplings
the soup dumplings here are pretty good for the price  i love their shredded beef with rice cakes  scallion pancakes and also their noodles  the place is very clean and there are a lot of seating areas  the service isn't so bad for a chinese restaurant and they're very fast  this is a cash only place so bring cash 
i am in love with this place!was in flushing for some business related procurement and when in flushing  of course get the chinese food!  so i yelped for the best xiao long bao (juicy buns) and this place came up  and it did not disappointed!i ordered a traditional xlb (perfectly juicy  great skin that did not break)  crabmeat xlb (again  delicious and flavorful with actual crab pieces meat)  the scallion pancake (tender  pull apart and just greasy enough) and salty tofu (the texture was a bit off  but flavor was good) and i truly enjoyed everything!it was so good that i ordered two more xlb to go to take home   unfortunately they were just too delicate for a to go order as when i got home  i noticed that half of the skins were broken and the juice had flown out   thus  best eaten fresh and pippin' hot!!!
came here for lunch   this restaurant is exactly what i was looking for  and what a restaurant of this type should be   i grew up in the bay area  and travel frequently to china and taiwan   nan xiang xiao long bao delivers an experience similar to what one would find in in asia   good dumplings and noodle dishes   it's worth heading out to flushing for this  will be back 
this place is amazing for a late dinner or midnight snack on the weekends   i regularly order the pork soup dumplings which pair excellently with a side of scallion pancake wrapped beef   the service is fast and there is rarely ever a wait to be seated   if you're also looking for a side of noodles i would go with one of the rice cakes if you're feeling something soft and chewy  preferably the pork with preserved vegetables   on the other hand the pan fried noodles is a good alternative if you're feeling crunchy instead be sure to keep in mind the check has to be paid with cash only 
i honestly did not like this place  the soup dumplings were decent and so was the food but the wait staff wasn't too friendly nor accommodating  the table i sat at was missing the hot sauce container  when we asked the waiter for some he took it from the adjacent table next to us and the patrons there were like we also need it  the waiter goes then you guys can share  i understand this is flushing and i'm not asking for five star accommodations but really you cannot get it from another table where the rest of the meal wouldn't have been awkward between us and the table next to us?
had a great saturday lunch here  the soup dumplings did not disappoint my queens bred and born friend brought us here on a saturday afternoon and it was packed  luckily the wait wasn't too long (i think the in and out is pretty fast in here too) we started off with some scallion pancake with beef  think thick crispy on the outside but doughy on the inside pancake encasing strips of beef with tasty brown sauce   piping hot  the rich scallion flavor and beef made a great combo  we ordered several orders of the pork soup dumplings and the crab soup dumplings  each were filled with piping hot rich delicious broth and lots of meat  i managed to perfect my soup dumpling eating technique (cool  nibble  inhale inside  then devour)  we all made sure not to waste any of that delicious soup!a must if you're in the ara!
well  i had high expectation on this one as nan xiang dumpling is quite famous in my hometown  shanghai  local people flow into that restaurant at the country town near shanghai  as the mini bao and other dim sum are so good that you miss them sometimes in the dream  this one didn't serve up to the reputation of nan xiang  with less flavor on their mini bao  i didn't even finish the whole 6 pack  the cooker and waiter aren't even from shanghai  guess just a knock off one  and they only accept cash and lots of people 
seating can be challenging in the popular flushing location on prince street  but the soup dumplings here are worth waiting for  any kind  they come out hot  so poke a tiny hole near the top with a fork or toothpick to let out some steam before engulfing the whole dumpling (the whole point of soup dumplings is drinking the soup  so you don't wanna bite into it and let all the soup leak out unless you have a spare bowl)  their other eats are pretty good  too! i love their beef scallion pancakes ^^ 
2 5 stars (mobile review does not allow half stars) on a fri evening  wait was about 20 30 min   we ordered the pork soup dumplings  fried pancake scallion  white wine sauce with chicken & chicken soup   pork soup dumpling  underwhelming   the skin was a bit thick   (super glad we only got one order basket)   pancake scallion  appears to be deep fried   we were used to the pan fried version so we didn't get care it  chicken soup  good taste  could taste the herbs   it came in a small (individual size) serving bowl  white wine sauce chicken   was a bit too salty  total meal was around $23 (prior to tip)   service was quick in getting our orders in but a toothache coming to wrap up your tap     cheers  wendy
there was a pretty long wait when we got there  thankfully we only waited for about twenty minutes for a table for two  got the salty soy milk  iced soy milk  garlic cucumbers  scallion pancake w  beef and two orders of the crab and pork soup dumplings  the garlic cucumbers are so damn good  loved the intense flavor of the garlic and freshness and crispness of the cucumbers  the iced soy milk was just perfect and definitely recommend that over the salty soy milk which we did not like  scallion pancake was solid and just what i expected  soup dumplings were above average but not the best i have had  they do a good job with the soup to dumpling ratio but could work on the dumpling skin which gets really hard after just a minute or two  overall pretty good food but wouldn't wait on line again  if there's no dine in tables just get some soy milk and garlic cucumbers to go! they're amazing!!!
as an act of faith in my fellow yelpers praise of nan xiang dumpling house  i ordered two bamboo steamers of xlb as soon as we sat down  when we arrived around 4 30 there were several open tables  of course  it wouldn't have been authentic if we weren't asked to move to a smaller table as the one we chose was deemed too large for the two of us  we chuckled  we were prepared to share  along with the xiao long bao (pork fillings)  we ordered scallion pancakes with spicy beef   both were superior products and were totally fun to eat   the dumplings were thin skinned and care had to be taken to lift each from the steamed lettuce beneath them to avoid tearing  i sacrificed one for the team learning that requirement  but was able to salvage some of the broth because i used the two hand method  chopsticks to gently lift the soup bag and place it quickly into the flat bottom spoon standing at the ready in my opposite appendage   they were just too good to waste even a drop   i bit off the topknot of each and backed away to allow the scalding steam to escape  leaving only the near boiling broth  still  burning the tongue is inevitable and part of the experience   i docked my lips against the small opening and slowly sucked the soup out  moving from left to right to siphon out as much as i could  then  i poured a small spoonful of vinegar and ginger into the volcano's punctured dome and devoured the entire remains in one large sucking gulp  it was the only way to maximize the desired tasteful sensation   and  it was great and all consuming! the beef filled scallion pancake was cut into 3 large pieces and was very good  not too oily  and a nice counterpoint to the xlb   this place is definitely going to be a regular stop on my irregular visits to flushing   the food so tasty and fun to engage  and the prices fair   just sorry i hadn't been there before 
i was really looking forward to this place for the xiao long bao or soup dumplings here since it's so highly praised  i ordered the pork and crab soup dumplings ($6 95) and though i didn't expect a lot of crab since the pork soup dumplings are $5 95  there were a few strands  i'd rather pay more and get actual crab meat  anyways the dumplings were ok   one broke and had soup spilled even before it hit my table  the soup was very cloudy and more salty than i like  the vegetable noodle soup ($4 95) was a very generous size but the broth was very salty and on the oily side  service was average 
came here for lunch after arriving in flushing for the weekend took a number to wait for a table and once seated  ordered xiao long boa and xiao mai i am delighted by the dumpling texture and taste i wish there are more options instead of fried or bun  types highly recommend for dim sum place if you are in flushing area 
no frills  inexpensive deliciousness  the best soup dumplings i've ever tasted  yummy scallion pancakes too  authentic food worth the visit!
holy soup dumplings! everyone's heard of joe's shanghai but nan xiang's soup dumplings shouldn't be missed out on either  and even though this dumpling house is located all the way out in flushing  that shouldn't deter any loyal xlb fanatics from hopping on the 7  both their namesake and the the pork crab xlb were good  so much broth packed into one little morsel  wrappers are the perfect medium between too thin and too gummy  delicate and yet not easily broken as you pick them up  cash only! but our meal of two servings of dumplings and one plate of scallion pancakes was under $30  i love good  cheap eats 
food is good  but terrible services  they feel like i don't give a shit because my food is good  no matter what you'd come and eat  i wish their boss could do something about it 
the qiao long nap here are very good   their seats are limited and the service is okay   they have one of the best shanghai dumplings in the area 
the go to place for soup buns  always leave with a satisfied stomach!
yes  the soup dumplings are yummy  it fully satisfies my soup dumpling cravings  but i also ordered their 紅油炒手 and it came under cooked  no  it wasn't even under cooked  it was uncooked  like i put it in my mouth  and one corner was cold  covered with flower  and hard  how does that even happen?! i was scarred  i never ordered it again  also  lines are long (so go at the right times) and service isn't that friendly  then again  it's flushing  note  if you like soy milk  the soy milk here is pretty damn good 
i love this restaurant  it is cheap  casual and fast  we love the pan fried pork buns  steamed crab meat and pork buns and seafood pan fried udon noodle  i always forget to bring cash but luckily there are many different banks a block away  the service is sub par but that is to be expected when a restaurant has such fast turnover of tables  i have yet to try the many breakfast and cold dish appetizers but always see other tables ordering them 
food is delicious  but the service is horrible  i'll take the time to do more exploring in flushing and take my business else where since there's definitely more places that serve the same food with adequate service 
by far one of the best soup dumplings in town   they are made to order  juicy  tasty  perfect dumpling skin  mmmm    i also love their crispy  salty  sweet  little bit of heaven known as a scallion pancake with beef   their rice cakes with chicken  shrimp and fish is another favorite 
this is one of my go to places when i'm craving soup dumplings  don't get me wrong though  everything here is pretty darn good! of course if you're coming here you definitely need to order the soup dumplings  they're super delicious and i like that the skin of their dumplings are thin  i've tried a lot of their noodle dishes before and they're all very good  i also really like their cold dishes and iced soy drink  overall everything is very good here  so what more are you waiting for?
this restaurant is very popular for its xiao long baos  on weekends  you can find a large group of people waiting outside to be seated  i recommend going on a weekday evening to avoid the long lines as a frequent visitor  i give this restaurant 4 5 stars  the 1 star deduction is for the staff  they can be pretty impatient  overall  this is a great restaurant choice for the long winter ahead  aside from xiao long baos  they make noodle soup dishes  fried udons and breakfast  chinese breakfast are the best! also  i love chinese restaurants because you get unlimited tea my top recommendations  i've tried both crab meat and pork xiao long baos  they are both good dishes but they can leave a slight greasy after feeling  scallion pancake breakfast   salt soy bean milk sweet soy bean milk shanghai pan fried u don
a very authentic spot for soup dumplings (xiao long bao 小籠包)  i've been coming here ever since i was a kid  up until now i still enjoy every single bite  i always start off with their fried dough and scallion pancakes  nothing too special  just your standard flushing type food  then comes the soup dumplings which you can actually watch them make it (depending where you're sitting)  the skin on the dumplings is very thin which is how i like it  the juice from the meat is so flavorful it's crazy  i also get the shanghai pan fried noodles which to be honest could be a little better  sometimes they put a little too much vegetables and not enough meat or noodles and it's just a plate of veggies at that point  to be honest i've never had an authentic shanghainese soup dumpling but i have had some other known soup dumpling spots (joes shanghai  din tai feng) and nan xiang in my opinion is better  make sure you bring cash cause that's all they take which isn't so different from their competitors  also expect to wait whenever the lunch rush hits but that's with anywhere around the area 
alert  vegetarian review  the bonus of working in flushing is  of course  the food    my colleagues and i were in the area for lunch  so we had to go to nan xiang for dumplings    since we could just waltz right in with no wait  i am positive that my review would be completely different    if i ate pork or beef  but i don't  i am pescatarian and mainly vegetarian  so  i ordered the vegetable noodle soup and the veggie dumplings  it was overall *fine*  the dumpling dough had a unique funky (kinda gross) taste  but the insides were chock full o' veggies   you must douse them with soy sauce  ginger and the spicy chili sauce to cover up the funky dough taste  i would not order those again  the soup was ok  a bit bland  but you can doctor it up with the spicy chili sauce  the noodles were ramen noodles and the portion is huge  so i took most of it home  i'm slowly realizing that the best bet for vegetarians who want a flavorful  nuanced and complex veggie noodle soup is to find a japanese restaurant such as ki sushi in brooklyn or soba ya in the e  village (insert dreamy eye roll)  biggest takeaway  if you don't eat pork  skip it  this place is not vegetarian friendly 
soup dumplings ftw  the only question is how many you want  don't burn your tongue though the sweet cold soy milk was good  too  but the salt hot soy milk was weird  maybe it's a chinese thing but like i said  just shut uppa you face and eat the soup dumplings  you jabroni 
let me begin by stating that some of the food is good but some is just fair at this establishment  however  the service is sub par to say the least  tea was served luke warm  we had to ask for black vinegar for dumplings and this is a cash only establishment  we would have ordered more food but due to the lack of interest of the wait staff we left  i prefer to get dim sum where the carts are steaming and filled to the brim with delicious bites of food  one and a half stars is not an option and two is probably too generous  the one and a half stars is based strictly regarding the food  oh by the way  they didn't even refill our tea 
always a great meal here  personal favourites  spicy beef noodle soup   juicy buns and hot soy milk 
the service and the price are alright  but seating wasn't that great  wouldn't consider it for a dating place  too crowded and nosey for a couple  the noodle soup we ordered went up cold  and the skin of xiaolongbao wasn't that great  feel like eating a dumpling skin rather that 包
food is 5 stars  service is 3 stars  waitress got some attitude there i will probably try some other places 
the xlbs were good  and the iced soy bean milk hit the spot after a hot day out and about  one of the better xlb places in new york  but other than that i felt the rest of the dishes were just okay  but not that great  good value for money though!
amazing! so worth the wait  should there be one  i'm a vegetarian  my husband isn't  we were equally overjoyed! my favorite dish is the fried buns with chives and eggs  his is the steamed pork buns 
i always get the same thing from here and it's always good every time  xiao long bao and the scallion pancake with rou and hoisin inside  you could even get that to go and eat it like a sandwich i've had their dofujiang and youtiao but that is made the same and tastes the same everywhere lol they're chilli oil is good!one of the better places in flushing to go if you're not native chinese cash only 
absolute favorite spot in new york city area for soup dumplings! crispy noodle dishes are great  too  i'm giving four stars because the wait is just too long 
my second stop during my flushing food tour  came here solo and ordered one order of xlb  there was another american near by doing the same! great minds think a like? perhaps   i was a little nervous eating xlb right after eating 12 wontons at white bear  i only had about 2 block walk to this place   so i don't think i digested enough  however  since the place was pretty busy and their xlb is steamed to order  it took awhile! thank goodness   about 15 20 minutes passed   usually you'd get hangry  but then i was relieved i had time to just relax and sip on tea  the xlb came out and i was already impressed  the dumpling skin was thin   probably some of the thinnest i've seen in quite some time  they offer the traditional vinegar based dipping sauce  which i'm not a fan of  but they give you slithers of ginger which is nice  the xlb are pretty good here  the broth tastes clean and the pork filling isn't too heavy  i don't think these are the best i've had in nyc  but they are pretty good overall  the restaurant offers other shanghai dishes which  i normally would devour if i were not full already   pancakes  noodles  stir fries  etc  great price and great quality of xlb! definitely a must try for soup dumpling lovers 
first of all  the xlp (soup dumplings) were pretty damn good for the price  i tried both the crab meat pork and plain pork  preferred the pork more because the crab tasted kind of stringy  everything else looked really greasy and not carefully prepared or made but you get what you pay for   my friend got the udon consisted of 97% just flavored udon and the rest bok choy  nothing special  my rating is solely based on the soup dumplings  i would have given it a 5 if they properly served it with ginger (vinegar was already on the table) and if the broth was a little more clear  we came at a non peak hour (3pm) the service was extremely bad  we were basically forgotten  our waitress kept on disappearing and then we found her eating on lunch break  lol! i'm trying kf xlp next because i heard their other dishes are also actually good  i prefer a variety of dishes for a satisfying meal  i'll come back here if i was ever in the area for a little bite    and the only thing i'd be ordering are the pork soup dumplings 
we had a craving for pork buns so decided to come here since there is always a wait outside  must mean its good! go inside and get a number  then the guy comes out and calls you when there is a table ready  efficient  the wait wasn't bad for lunch and we were seated immediately  lots of seating inside  we ordered the pan fried noodles with chicken  pork and crab buns  the noodles were good and enough to share for four people  we saved our appetite for the best part   the buns! the crab buns are delicious with loads of flavor  if you order both pork and crab  i recommend eating pork first and crab last  the pork buns tasted so bland after we ate the crab first  both are delicious but you really noticed a different in the soup when comparing  great shanghainese spot when you're craving buns and right along the busy restaurant strip on prince street 
my five stars is explicitly reflective of their dim sum   the soup dumplings and fried dumplings are amazing   i have returned many times for them and will continue to return for them   i have tried other dishes and was not pleased but i am usually not familiar with chinese dishes   the atmosphere customer service was pretty decent nothing to complain about   my stars go simply to their dumplings because they are probably the best in the urban ny area  will definitely be coming back   came back here and the customer service was way better and the food was just as good as i craved it to be   this will continue to be the place i go for bomb dumplings 
i've had my share of soup dumplings n this one is below average! two of the dumplings broke cos one was stuck to another and the other was stuck to the sheet under it! soup was too salty n fatty  meat (pork n crab filling) was low quality as well  i had ones ones from kung fu xiao long bao recently n that was great  much thinner skin n cleaner soup! to top it off  the service was just horrible  the waiter didn't even look at us while taking the order n never came back to the table! tried to give an order when she came to give the check to the table next to us  seemed like she heard us but no acknowledgement  spoke in chinese to someone else n that person ended up getting us the wrong order! a big no thank you! don't even bother to try this spot!
first time visit thanks to yelp reviews my family is visiting from out of the country and have never tried dumplings so i searched on yelp for an authentic spot and found this place i arrived earlier today when it was raining  it was packed  there was a wait  that's a good thing in my book  i told the lady we were a party of 9 and she said it would be about 25 minutes  i was sort of worried that it wouldn't please my out of town family and was hoping for the best we waited about 20 min before they sat us down in another room  the waiter came and served most of us hot tea  i guess he ran out of tea so he gave water to the rest of the group  we ended up asking for tea from the waitress when she showed up to take our order  i ordered about 2 of almost every dumpling item on the menu  we also ordered seafood noodle soup  udon noodles  cucumber and garlic salad and crispy seafood noodle dish   the cucumber garlic salad was delicious! i am going to try to recreate this at home   the meat based steamed and pan fried buns (pork  crab  beef  tripe and chicken) were devoured by my carnivorous family  i assure you they enjoyed every bite   i enjoyed the crispy seafood noodles  vegetarian dumplings  scallion pancakes and tiny (quarter sized) red bean buns i don't eat meat so i made sure to ask the waiter what dish he had every time he came to the table  the waiters avoid eye contact and do not want to answer you  they literally attempted to run away as fast as they put the dishes down  i had to repeat myself up to 3x every time they came by to ask what magical dish they had brought this time  one waiter looked at me and said that he didn't know! how funny! we also got a quizzical look from another waiter when we asked for napkins and a knife  i didn't feel that they were very friendly which is why i took off a star we were stuffed by the time the check came and they were still bringing dishes to our table! we had already paid and were chatting when they brought another dish of pan fried noodles  after we left  we crossed the street to enjoy bubble tea at sunway  i think we made a good choice and would return! my phone battery was low so i didn't get to take pics of the dishes  there's always time! i did happen to snap a shot of the ladies in the kitchen making the dumplings on the way out!
dumplings! checkbeef scallion pancake! checkstir fried rice cakes! checkshanghai fried noodles! checkthis place has a simple menu and is one of the best place for shanghai food in flushing area!
really good soup dumplings here  i really enjoyed the scallion pancakes  the wait was pretty quick  the menu is kind of small as they only focus on a few dishes  but overall very delicious and i will be returnin
came to queens with my family and hubs suggested getting xlb for lunch  i was a bit worried about parking and the wait but somehow it wasn't bad at all  the service is very good  we ordered a bunch of different dishes  salty tofu  shanghai udon  scallion pancake  pancake with beef  rice cake with seafood and of course  xiao long bao   ) we really liked the rice cake in particular  the texture & flavors were good  i liked the salty tofu too  xlb is deelicious and very meaty  just the right amount of soup that it's not overflowing and seasoned well  i was a bit disappointed in the pancake with beef since that seems to be a favorite  the beef inside was cold but it was my first time trying something like this  shanghai udon wasn't great  a little bland but good for our toddler because it wasn't too salty and he loves thick noodles he can pick up and feed himself  the pan fried dumpling & pan fried noodles look good too  will have to try next time i'd come here again over other options but that seems to be the general consensus   )
ahhh  i've never found a place where stale fried food was good   or where i could stomach left overs  from recommendation from a local   went here for dumplings  absolutely amazing  fresh   so fresh   bc line is of the door all the time   even to go it was about 15 to 20 min for the food   cash only so walk with your coins  scallion pancakes with beef  wow  mind blowing  pork dumplings    "
great news i just passed this restaurant today and they are open!  i'm so glad  it's a great restaurant with great food!  i'll be there tomorrow morning for breakfast 
this is by far my favorite soup dumpling spot! i had to pay this spot a more current visit before this review and i am truly glad that i did! nan xiang's soup dumplings have hands down the best soup  six soup dumplings come in an old fashioned bamboo steamer  your weapons are the spoon and the tongs  add some vinegar sauce on top and you are ready! just be caution because the soup is very hot! my party got lucky and we got batches that just came out of their oven but that's not without a little bit of wait  the soup was still hot and steamy  the skin was fresh and the meat was so flavorful  my taste buds could not thank me more! while you wait for the soup dumplings  order some appetizers  a personal favorite is the spicy beef & tripe appetizer  marinated with sichuan mala spiced oil and topped with cilantro  i love their fresh  made in the house hot soy milk! you can order it sweet or savory  overall  nan xiang always meet my expectations of a good xiao long bao!
before my nyc trip i've been watching all these soup dumpling videos on youtube  this spot came up a lot and i had to check it out  came here for lunch monday  took the train all the way to flushing for this  man   so many asians in flushing i must say  felt like home  the restaurant is pretty big 3 separate dining areas   but only one bathroom! we order warm soy milk  crispy long doughnuts  pork soup dumplings  crab soup dumplings  shui mai (filled with rice)  spicy beef and tripe  scallion pancake w  sliced beef  and shrimp stir fry of some sort  food was delicious expecially the soup dumplings  everyone was kind of thrown off by the shui mai  which was filled with rice  i guess we all expected pork  overall a great place for good soup dumplings 
the meal today was very disappointing   the soup dumplins which was suppose to be the star was the worst   the skins were tough and they all broke before i even touched them   all the precious liquid in the basket    the pork & veg wonton in spicy peanut sauce was lacking sauce   barely any peanut flavor   i will not be coming back anytime soon 
not going to go in depth to help ya'll out  okay?you should go here  that's it  the food is freaking amazing  as you can tell from all the other users' photos! if you're in the area  and even if you're not   go here  there's a municipal parking lot right across the street for convenience dumplings  soup  noodles  scallion pancakes  eat everything and bless your stomach!
i have came here so many times  love all kind of bums but  this time i will recommend this spicy beef noodles  so great!!! don't miss it!!!
popular place in flushing  the xlb's are very good  good light broth  the fried porks buns were tasty as well  however  not a big fan of the scallion pancake (barely any scallion  yes i am spoiled as i have been eating too many korean seafood pancakes!) and the pan fried noodles were very greasy  but great place for quality eats and we weren't rushed even though there was a steady stream of customers 
came here on a saturday afternoon and was seated quickly  we ordered the signaturel pork dumpling  crab dumpling  and beef noodle soup  just going to comment on their soup dumplings since they're what the place is known for   the dumpling skins were too thick  there was a decent amount of soup inside but the taste was very plain  and slightly over greasy  meat was ok; the crab dumplings were better than the pork onesoverall i rate the dumplings as decent  definitely had better ones elsewhere  had high expectations going in seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews here  but left disappointed 
caught the lucky 7 express train to this dumpling spot on a saturday and i guess everyone else was thinking the same because they had a line out the door  pretty good hype for a traditional xlb place but we waited and finally got a table  we ordered the spicy beef and tripe to start and order a reg and crab xlb for the main event  the beef had great flavor and just enough spice and cilantro to keep you coming back for more  the xlb were just average  the soup was darker and fattier than i'm use to and skin to meat ratio was poor  for only 6 and about a buck each or more if you ordered the crab  i'd rather spend my money at shanghai heping restaurant or shanghai cafe deluxe in good ole c town where you get 8 beautifully tender meat filled to the max soup dumplings for only $5!! say whaaa?i mean those were the only items we tried and it was my first time there but maybe if i'm lucky i'll give them another chance   also its cash only 
first ever post   i actually wrote a review for this spot! how is this even happening??this food so proper it brings music to a stormy dayprices are premier like the premier league so tip well they're open til midnight!??if you've been rude today you don't even deserve to go here pan fried dumplings and udon noodlei love noodle
i've been here twice  the first time the food was mediocre and the environment is very fast paced  i wanted to give this place a second try due to all of the high reviews  however  this second time i was very disappointed  we ordered the shanghai noodles (which we were told had pork in it)  shaomai and beef scallion pancakes the shaomai was great and came quickly  the onion pancakes were way too saucy and took awhile the shanghai noodles which i was anticipating to be wonderful did not come with any meat and took forever  when i asked about the meat  the server took it back and it was never to be seen again as i waited for 30 extra minutes  i finally got fed up and asked our server to remove it from our tab and cancel the order both the server and cashier were very rude  i will not be returning to this restaurant ever again 
i have a confession to make  i'm new to all that is soup dumplings  yes  you heard it right  and yes  i know exactly what you're thinking  how on earth has she gone this far without having these foods in her life? well thank goodness i went to nan xiang because let's be real people    i was hanging on by a thread  after a fun night filled with booze and more booze (yee style)  we headed here in search for late night bites * being that there was a group of us  we ordered plenty to go around  pork xiao long bao  i see that it has certainly lived up to its expectations  this is the kind of food you want to write a song about  it's that good  no great  i've come to learn that there's a true artistry to the soup dumpling  everyone apparently had their own "technique" from the transfer to the spoon  to the actual action of eating the dumpling  it's brilliant actually  i went the traditional route and pierced the skin and let the soup settle in the spoon before i slurped it up  the skin is delicate  the broth is savory and steaming  and the pork was scrumptious  pan fried dumplings  crispy  juicy  flavorful  it's all that you would want and expect  scallion pancake with sliced beef  my second favorite item of the night  it was doughy yet crispy and not overly greasy (which a lot of scallion pancakes are) it came with hoisin sauce which was a great compliment to the dish  thank you ben l  for ordering this! this place really set the standard for all my future soup dumpling experiences  i'm officially hooked  after visiting nan xiang that night  i've been itching to come back  anyone up for a trip? ________________________*if only during my college days we had xiao long bao  it's seriously a great drunken food  (aside from the usual pizza )
went here today for the first time with my boyfriend around 3 pm  the lady at the register ignored us for a solid minute before waving us to go into the back to be seated  we ordered the spicy bamboo shoots  scallion pancake  & pork soup dumplings  the spicy bamboo (cold dish) arrived immediately  they were boring  the dish wasn't even spicy & that is confusing as the bamboo was tossed in chili oil  won't be ordering that dish again  then the dumplings arrived  the dumplings were really tasty  they had a good amount of soup inside  i was annoyed that a table that ordered after us got their scallion pancake before we did; we waited another 10 minutes after to get our pancake  the pancake wasn't good either  it was fried well but nothing special about it  overall  this is a cheap place to eat  my bill was less than $15 for 3 dishes  beware  the establishment has a c grade on their window 
this place is awesome  let's be honest about how it differs from chinatown first   the area is less crowded  easier to travel to from within queens  the waitstaff is way nicer to youthat being said  the food is pretty on par as well  when it comes to quality and price  the food holds up to chinatown for sure  nan xiang dumpling house has 3 full dining rooms to meet the demand they have (at least on a weekend night)  4 of us ate for $10 a person (tip included) we got 2 orders of the pork soup dumplings (6 in each order)  pan friend udon noodles  rice cakes with chicken  and a small vegetable dish  one thing i will say is that they don't have a ton of vegetables on the menu  i like to add in some variety to all the pan fried goodness and there weren't many vegetable options here  also  the rice cakes were a bit chewy but not bad overall  this place is totally worth it  soup dumplings have at least 3 spoonfuls of soup in them    sometimes more if that's actually possible  the prices are good  and there is endless hot tea  i don't know if that makes a difference to anyone but to me  that's key 
i've been going here for a few years now  ever since i came to ny for school  hands down  they make the best soup dumplings  i like both the crab and pork soup dumplings   you can't really go wrong w  either one  their noodles are also suuuuuper delicious  albeit too oily (but hey  that's chinese food for ya)  one of my favorite dishes is the beef w  hot pepper noodles (dry)  it's better than the other pan fried noodles in my opinion  i also prefer it over the noodle dish w  soup  you should also try the scallion pancake   sooo good! extremely affordable + super yummy  definitely one of my favorite places (and one that i find myself craving pretty often!)
one of the best restaurant in flashing the vegetable noodle soup awesome and the vegetables steamed dumplings so good   try it you will love it i know i will go back to try more of there vegetarian dishes  
good in terms if authentic chinese but unless you know what items you want to try it's very confusing  the staff isn't really helpful in explaining what items are  etc also  after the food offer rush (this is dim sum style) they staff rarely returns  we wanted more for but had too leave our room and hunt them down  getting more water or tea was basically impossible 
amazing food!  the soup dumplings are one of the best i've ever tasted  but the rice cakes and udon are a great choice too  go and i guarantee you'll want to come back soon 
it's affordable for sure! however  i wasn't very impressed with the xiao long bao  i have had better   i recommend   pork better than crab and pork soup dumplings  the combination taste was odd  i really like the scallion pancakes w  beef though  that was good  but eat it as soon as it gets to you because it becomes oily and stale if it gets a little cold 
tasty tasty food!we made a pit stop here before leaving flushing for the day  and we were not disappointed! we ordered pork soup dumplings  pan fried pork buns  and hand made dumplings  all were excellent and full of flavor  i highly recommend this little place for a quick dumpling fix!
i'm not sure i would rate this higher than joe's shanghai  it is cleaner  their servers are not as rude as joe's  and you don't exactly have to share tables with other parties (though you are still practically sitting on top of them)  the soup dumplings here are okay  i think joe's has a better taste (meaning more msg?)  and i do like that nan xiang has other dumplings to offer too  we also had the pan fried pork dumplings (they were only okay)  and the spicy dumplings with peanut sauce  the scallion pancake with beef was pretty good  and we took some cold soy bean milk to go  the price point is great  no argument there 
very good  i wasn't expecting this  but my wife and daughter actually like the soup dumplings at little dumpling better! i feel they're the same  the veggie straddled dumps were good  and i loved the chive & egg fried bun  my wife liked the garlic cucumber  the service was pretty cut & dry service  complete with the lady who speaks pretty much zero english 
as a child of shanghainese parents  i think it is safe to say i know a thing or so about soup dumplings aka xiao long baos the dumplings are average  nice  meaty and juicy  however it was missing that flavor that makes a person go "mmmmmmm"  one item on the menu that stood out to me was the sesame pancake  it definitely made me go "mmmmm" let me order another  i won't not suggest ordering the pan fried dumplings  they were extremely subpar  the service  however was excellent  attentive and the food came quick 
went with a friend and it was a good time  we didn't really know what to get but the waitress helped us get all the popular items and we really enjoyed it  their food is good and good priced  will come back here again 
listed as closed but definitely not closed  i almost lost the chance to eat delicious soup dumpling again because of yelp  can't trust anyone these days 
nan xiang dumpling house is actually called nan xiang long bao  it is a dumpling restaurant in flushing  take the 7 train to the last stop in flushing  they stop serving dumplings at noon on weekdays  i came at 1pm and so i ordered the bean curd and cilantro dish and the scallion pancakes  my meal was $9 total  they offer you tea and give a side of sliced ginger  the bean curd is a cold dish and comes thinly slides in some kind of oil  really tasty and not too salty  the scallion pancakes come in 6 big pieces  two or three people can share one  inexpensive and yummy 
good soup dumplings   there are also a good variety of small dishes  like chinese tapas   the hot soy milk is great in cold weather 
we had many orders  my favorite are steamed pork and steamed crab meat  these 2 dishes reminded me the best xiao long baos i had in taipei and shanghai  juicy and delicious  we could taste and drink the soup inside the baos  really good   however  the pan fried pork buns were a bit dry and tough  i felt they were not as fresh as xiao long baos  we also had beef & chili pepper noodle soup  it was surprisingly yummy; especially those little chili!! i can't wait to come back soon 
always busy  sometimes hard to get a table right away  but the food is worth it  service is pretty good  the soup dumplings are amazing  prices for everything is really good 
i really enjoy this place a lot  everything there id very cheap and affordable  their soup dumplings are about $6 and theyre very good  i also get their scallion pancakes which are sooo good  i love them  ive also gotten their pan fried noodles but those were a little too oily for me  i highly recommend this place when trying to eat good food but on a budget  the downside is that its extremely busy and sometimes theres a long wait  also  since its so busy  they dont clean as throughly as i'd like  also  they dont accept cash 
when is chinese food not chinese food ?when it is done by nan xiang xiao long bao; that is when even the ubiquitous chicken with brocolli came out different; made us go hmmmm all dishes were a cut above regular chinese food my chinese guests were impressed as well; they said it reminded them of home now if you will excuse me  burrrrrp !!
food is mediocre at best  they didn't have half the items i ordered despite being a tuesday afternoon  they're prices are okay  but i'd prefer chinatown xiao long baos  if i ever had to wait for a table here i would just leave; it's not worth my time  the staff here are forgetful and slow  the table next to me had a piece of plastic on his soup 
amazing  absolutely a must go if you're in the area  simple menu but they do everything so efficient and perfectly spot on with their flavors and authenticity spicy beef noodles were definitely big enough to share and broth was super flavorful if you're interested in getting that!
amazing xiao long bao!!! i love this place and always try to stop by when i'm in the area  i lived in the ny metro area most of my life and never found a place better than this (except when i've travelled to taiwan of course!)
always a quick  reliable  and delicious meal  my family and i always leave full and satisfied  the soup dumplings are a must order and i recommend this place to anybody looking for a convenient meal 
the reason why this gets my first yelp review is because i just ate here yesterday and it's as good as it was a few years ago  it has always has been very cheap and who does not like xiao long bao? the staff is very attentive and brought my food out quick  nothing to complain about  sure  it's not the most decorative restaurant in the world  but i dont mind  as long as my cravings are satisfied with no dent in my pocket  feeling quite lucky to live in flushing today  so much good food and many more reviews to come!
the food is amazing  their soup dumplings are very tasty  i will go back to try out other items on their menu  this was my first time trying it and i'm glad i did  the tables are a  it to close together but other than that the place is clean 
this is a good spot for soup dumplings  i always get the pork because for some reason the crab tastes strange  also get the soybean milk here it's really good  as for the other food here  it's mediocre  the service here is average although the receptionist is rude  so one star down for that 
my opinion on nan xiang's diminishing quality is now confirmed  nan xiang is just above the mediocre level now  sure  its name keeps this place popular since tourist and foodies still flock here by the dozens but a seasoned xiao long bao enthusiast would know where to get cheaper or better quality soup dumplings the soup dumplings from my most recent meal still had thick skin and the soup was kind of thick with pork impurities  the flavor is still good but for some reason it had a beefy note to it scallion pancake with sliced beef ($4 95)   bland and barely any beef inside  there was hardly a coating of sauce to safe it as well  (6 10)soy milk ($1 50)   good but its hard to mess this up  comes with a plate of fried dough on the side  dip the dough into the milk for the full experience  (8 10)salt soy bean curd ($2 50)   they forgot about this dish twice and when they finally realized  they tried to heat the bowl of tofu up in the microwave that is in clear view from the tables  the tofu obviously sat at the counter for some time since the quick radiation blast did nothing to heat it up  the luke warm feel and fishy (from the tiny shrimps) flavor was disgusting and this tofu was a huge disappointment  (3 10)
best soup dumplings  period  joes shangai or joes ginger can't touch the dumplings here  been coming here for a while  they are spot on every time  the scallion pancakes are great as is the salted bean curd and soy bean milk  it's also fun watching people eating soup dumplings for the first time  it's quiet the task and can be dangerous!
get the soup dumplings and scallion pancakes  you won't be disappointed  pros quick service delicious foodcons street parking is extremely hard to find  but i've always been pretty lucky   cash only
service went down hill and sanitary conditions have gotten bad  how are the employees going to wash there hands without soap in the bathroom? i will not be coming back 
food it good  we got the steamed crab pork bun  it was really good  the service is good too  however  thr hostess needs an attitude adjustment 
definitely has the best soup dumplings in flushing!! don't be a fool and go to joe's shanghai  this place is better and is bigger = less wait time!!i used to be a joe's shanghai activist till i was introduced to nan xiang  the soup dumplings are the best i've had ! you can't go wrong with either the pork or the pork with crab soup dumplings  also make sure to order the scallion pancake with sliced beef!! definitely a must have here  if you're getting noodles  the shanghai noodles pan fried nooodles are delicious but a bit oily the food comes out really fast but the service isnt the best  however  this is typical for almost any busy establishment in flushing so you kinda get used to it  its also a cash only place so make sure to bring money!! the place is relatively cheap so you won't be breaking the bank going here but you'll leave very full!
i've been wanting to try this place since we moved to flushing last august  and we finally did this past weekend  my only regret is that we didn't try it earlier! this was our first time trying soup dumplings  so while i can't speak to how good nan xiang is compared to other establishments  i can say everything we tried was incredible  we ordered    steamed pork buns  steamed crab and pork buns  cucumber with garlic   pan fried shanghai udon   scallion pancake with sliced beefthe must try things  in my opinion  are the pancake  pork buns and the udon  the others were also really good  i would order them again  but could also go without them  the udon and the pancake are what i've really been craving ever since we went  i can't wait to go back!
seriously!?worst soup dumplings ever!  i couldn't believe how subpar the quality was  from the thick skin of the dumpling to the sad case of meat they called pork inside of it   color me spoiled by din tai fung  but this sure isn't it spicy beef tripe tasted like formaldehyde   the pan fried noodles were so greasy   and the steamed dumplings my friend ordered looked like they were thrown into the microwave minutes before they were brought out and while we're in the same vein  our orders were coming out literally minutes after we placed them   efficiency aside  am i the only one who thinks that's bad news?  i was getting skeeved out so much by the aspect of it all that i even started questioning the quality of the water when they came to refill our glasses   did they stick the plastic pitcher (that looked it it hadn't been rinsed off in weeks) underneath a rusty tap and call it a day?that's it   i'm done 
i've been going to this place for awhile and it's definitely become one of my go to places to take my out of town friends to  i mainly go for the soup dumplings as this place is known for it and i remember seeing this restaurant on the chinese channel one time  service for soup dumplings is quick  only downfall about this place is they often run out of the red bean puffs which is one of my favorite appetizers  the past 4 times i've eaten here they've ran out of it  service is okay  i often have to call the waiter and asks for refills of water tea or to even place an order  aside from all that  if you're looking for a unique authentic soup dumpling place  this is the go to spot 
came in with much higher expectations  the xiao long baos were mediocre  as were the noodles xiao long bao skin was too thick at the bottom and too thin at the too making it impossible to pick up without breaking  but besides breaking  it just tasted too doughy their noodles were extra greasy and just tasted like american chinese cuisine  and not authentic the good thing was the scallion pancake with the beef  good and crunchy with flavourful sauce and beef business was busy  which is apparently the norm here  seems like the only big xiao long bao restaurant in the area  so not surprised  but i don't think it's worth it   wouldn't go again 
so yummy!! too bad it's so far away from where i live in manhatten  ( best soup dumplings i've ever had!! idk why there was no line here! the dumplings have so much soup (that beats all the dtf's out there even though i was never really a fan) and the dough is soft yet slightly chewy  my bf and i ordered 6 pork and 6 crab soup dumplings  a beef roll  and a rice cake  we couldn't even get to the beef roll because we were so stuffed so we brought it back for the next day's breakfast  the only reason why i didn't give this place five stars is because their stuff is super oily  i can't drink too much of the soup dumpling's soup so i have to pour mine out at around the fourth one  the soup is super oily (hence why it's good) and the rice cakes were definitely soaked in oil  good but so unhealthy 
nan xiang soup dumplings [insert greater than symbol here since yelp won't allow me to put one in] joe's shanghai's soup dumplingsmy most recent visit  i had to get the venerable soup dumplings brought to me as takeout  but they were still piping hot and fantastic  the soup is always ready to scald your mouth  so be prepared and careful  order a side of scallion pancakes  and you're set  budget friendly too  love this place 
previously michelin star recommended   key word  previously***   i'm not going to hate on this place  but just stating facts   if you come here for their crab and pork soup dumplings and scallion pancake  you will not be disappointed   otherwise  their pork soup dumpling was not that great   there was a lack of seasoning for their pork filling   their seafood stir fry was ok  good noodles  but bad toppings   the fried dumplings was also ok   their beef and tripe in hot chili oil was a little worse than ok   the cut of beef is a thicker cut  making them chewier and less flavorful    the staff is very nice  and service is good   i'd recommend trying this place out  but don't jump on the hype train until you try it 
i love this place so much  i'm a huge fan of their soup dumplings  crispy noodles  rice cakes  pork buns  crispy dough  and literally everything i've ever tried here  it's quite inexpensive and i think it's great quality for the price  it's super packed especially during lunch and dinner hours  but service is pretty fast and i've never had to wait for more than 10 minutes to be seated 
came here on a sunday late afternoon  there was no wait  i have seen many people wait to eat here so we decided to try this place out  had the crab meat soup dumplings  pan fried pork buns  and shanghai udon noodles  soup dumplings were okay  i still prefer joe's shanghai soup dumplings  the udon noodles were plain nothing special  overall don't see the hype for this restaurant  definitely had better soup dumplings and shanghai udon noodles elsewhere 
i'm a die hard fan of the soup dumplings at joe's shanghai and remain a fan even after trying out nan xiang   i prefer joe's because their dumplings are soupier and less meaty  and the skins are slightly thinner  however  i still had a great meal at nan xiang and would come back the next time i'm in flushing  2 of us came here for dinner and were seated promptly  we ordered the soup dumplings and the shao mai  i had no complaints about the soup dumplings (other than that they weren't from joe's)  but the shao mai was nowhere near what i was expecting  i ordered them thinking they would be like dimsum shao mai  but the ones that came out were filled with sticky rice and had a completely different (and yucky) taste  i would have loved to try to some other things on the menu if there weren't only 2 of us eating  the food took a while to come out compared to other chinese restaurants i've been to  but service was fine and the waitresses were courteous as with most places in flushing  this place is cash only!
all introductory visits to nan xiang should consist of one thing  the xiao long bao  otherwise known as soup dumplings  believed to have originated in nan xiang  a suburb of shanghai  in the late 19th century  these dumplings acquired their name due to the small bamboo ("xiao long") baskets they were often cooked in  eventually  they made their way over to a cooking oil store turned restaurant called din tai fung  the rest  as they say  is history nan xiang dumpling house is reputed to serve up some of the best xiao long bao in nyc  although those who don't live in or near flushing  queens may find it a bit of a trek  thankfully  the restaurant is located a short walk from the main street stop on the 7 line and on a friday afternoon  the dining room was mostly empty  we were quickly seated  given tea  and small laminated menus  ordering was a breeze (remember  why else are you here?) and the dishes came to our table in short time so  the pork soup dumplings  the ones at nan xiang veer on the larger side  although it wasn't necessarily a good thing in hindsight  the skin was thin  but still with a good chew  and the broth inside the dumpling was piping hot and savory  the addition of a little vinegar sauce with ginger is a personal preference  but i find that it helps counter the pork flavor successfully  the disappointing factor  however  was the fact that 3 out of 6 of the dumplings we received had broken skins  a discovery that was quite saddening  to say the least we also ordered two extra dishes  the fuqifeipian and pan fried udon  the first is near and dear to my heart as its origins lie in my hometown  chengdu  a city in the sichuan province  history lessons aside [1]  the dish consists of thinly sliced beef and tripe doused in a chili sauce and served cold  while the version at nan xiang was tasty  the beef and tripe slices were too thick  and the chili sauce was unbalanced as well; the amount of oil was too generous  and i missed the extra dose of sichuan peppercorns  the udon wasn't particularly memorable either  although the noodles had a good texture  they were stir fried in a monotonous sauce  highlighted only by the sparse adding of pork and greens while they still serve up a respectable (if not half broken) tray of xiao long bao  i've heard that the quality at nan xiang has gone down over time  perhaps it's true  but unfortunately  it's not a hypothesis i'll be able to test   [1] the dish is attributed to a husband and wife couple who sold their beef and tripe slices out of their home in chengdu  sichuan in the 1930s  the dish was originally termed "husband and wife's offal slices"  or "fuqifeipian"  but a traveling merchant liked the dish so much  he re wrote the "fei" as the character for "lung"  to make it somewhat less unappealing 
i love the food  had the famous soup dumpling  definitely the best i've had  the atmosphere was well noised  not too quiet  sometimes a bit loud  but i still love it 
best soup dumplings ever! the scallion pancakes with beef and the udon noodles are delicious as well  service is fast  on weekends there might be a wait and it's crowded but it usually moves fast  and it's cash only  but i absolutely love their food! would definitely recommend 
the soup dumplings here are very good and flavorful  it's good for the cheap price  only took off a star because the service is just okay 
i love me some good soup dumplings  nan xiang has some of the best soup dumplings  it's the only reason why you come to this place i really enjoy the crab meat soup dumplings  the soup is so delicious  i love slurping the soup  then poceed to eat and enjoy the rest of the soup dumplings  i could eat a dozen plates of those  yummy!!
got the scallion pancake with beef  steamed pork buns  and soup dumplings  all very tasty and very solid  would come again 
the food is reasonably priced  tasty and served fairly quickly for a packed venue  enjoyed vege dumplings and seafood soup with noodles  bathroom needs immediate attention 
i have nothing to say but good things about this place! one of the many things i miss about living in queens  it can get busy here so if you plan on visiting at a peak time  be patient  the ambiance is pretty mediocre   i would have to say they could do a better job keeping it clean but it's not authentic if it's clean and doesn't smell my favorites are the steamed vegetable dumplings  the xiao long bao  the scallion pancakes  and the fried udon! if it's your first time going  definitely try the xiao long bao and scallion pancakes  the service here is pretty hit or miss   sometimes you can have great  friendly service and other times you will have the worst customer service  honestly  the food and price make up for that!
the price is good and the food is great! i've been to joe's shanghai so many times and to be honest  i like this place a little more! the xiao long bao (soup dumplings) is a must get  it was really good and juicy  the crab xlb   i can't taste the crab as much but its still really good! i recommend you order everything all at once because they took forever to give me my scallion beef pancake  oh but let me tell you    it was soooo good! worth the wait! i want to come back and try other things but i'm from california  when i come back to visit    i'll be going here instead of joe's 
incredibly well priced if not well presented but not trying to be fancy  this is your chinese grandmothers dim sum at basement bottom prices  we walked out of there with satisfied and full for a little over $25 including tip for two  their soup dumplings are out of sight and the beef short rib chive pancake is also exceptional  definitely worth the trip to flushing 
love love love! for the price  quality  and quantity you're really getting your money's worth  i love bringing my friends here cause they always order at least six different plates of soup dumplings  while i always order their scallion pancake and shanghai noodles  their soy milk is really good too! if you go during the peak hours you might have to wait an hour or more but the food comes really quickly so thats a plus 
apparently its michelin star rated  which i was surprised about  service is quick  and i was able to get a table of 5 within 10 minutes (the place does get packed though)  the braised beef noodle was goood  and filling  it comes with lots of noodle & about 6 pieces of sliced beef  but come here for the  xiao long baos of course  theyre tasty  flavorful  and the texture of the bao was just right   not too thick & not too thin  becareful   it's super hot once it hits your table so let it cool for a bit 
very competent soup dumpling  competent side and other dishes not much wrong with the place  but not five star quality food 
i hate it   shitty service and cashier is a real piece of work she was on the phone while an elder lady stands there waiting to pay   cashier told the lady that was her husband on the phone and he was more important  i was lit   just go to joe shanghai it's only 2 blocks away and much better soup dumplings food is mediocre at best not sure what the hype is about  
the namesake soup dumplings were very well made  skin was perfect and held together without breaking throughout the course of one person polishing off 5 by himself  great flavor as well  the real standout for me was the beef scallion pancakes  wrapped with hoisin sauce and fried for a bit  these things were incredible  great decision to stop by before my flight in lga
the place is very disorganized and does not look clean! food is really not that great either  there are better places in flushing!
just had sunday brunch this morning with my family  eight of us   xiao long bai (4 orders) and a lot of tasty dishes  drunken chicken was not available again   i was so impressed by by the waitress memorizing the entire order and repeated the long list without a mistaken   we did not wait long and everything were fresh and timely   plenty of time for my niece to catch her flight   hope drunken chicken is available on my next visit 
good soup dumplings for the area and nyc to be honest   however  service is almost non existent   even getting the check is a chore   they sometimes have only one server for the entire room   i don't ever see non chinese folks in here  as they're the only ones who can tolerate this kind of treatment 
the soy milk and the rice cake is great  will come back and visit  only down part is they make us squeeze in on those little tables 
some of the best dumplings i have ever had  pork soup dumplings are phenomenal  i found this place on my way to laguardia  i had an extra hour to kill before my flight so stopped in for dumplings  this spot is only 15 minutes from the terminals  if you have a layover and need to burn some time hop a taxi over also the garlic cucumbers were surprisingly tasty and an item i had never seen at a chinese restaurant before 
i'm hesitant to wright a review because i don't want to blow up this amazing secret!! but here it goes  yes  go  it is amazing  i've been there numerous times with many people  every one loves it! of all the great thing to order  3 are my favorite the soup dumplings (of course)  cucumber in garlic and the "shao my" (bad english spelling)  which is a steamed open top dumpling with what's looks like some type of rice in it 
my mom was in the mood for shanghainese food last time we were in flushing  so i led her here based on the strength of the reviews  yelp never lets me down  because all the food was delicious! the menu has helpful pictures of all of their signature dishes  and we quickly put in an order for soup dumplings  as well as a host of other goodies  first to land on the table was the beef noodle soup  which was excellent and had a generous portion of beef  better yet (and my personal favorite) was the scallion pancake with sliced beef  which was greasy and glorious  imagine a giant piece of fried bread  smeared with hoisin and stuffed with braised beef  chinese food doesn't get better than that  my mom doesn't even like fried food  and she admited it was tasty  my other favorite dish of the day was the rice cake with shredded pork and preserved mustard  it was executed so perfectly  so simple but done so right  i liked that they didn't make the rice cakes too salty and just let the flavors of the preserved mustard shine through  the shanghai shao mai were the only thing i didn't like  the combo of sticky rice and rice wrapper was too much for me  and i thought they needed a little more flavor  my mom  however  loved them  and they were super filling  the main event though was the soup dumplings  try to put in an order of these as soon as you sit down  as they take the longest to make  they were wonderful  with delicate skins barely containing the hot broth inside that just bursts out as you bite into them  not the best soup dumplings i've ever had  but probably the best i've had in flushing  the only complaint that i have is that they're very rich and heavy  i had 3  and it put me into food coma territory almost instantly  for a flushing restaurant  it was pretty clean  and service was prompt and efficient  everything is super affordable  we spent $30 on food for 3 people  and we were pretty full  if only i lived closer!
amazing food! i'm not sure what else to say beyond how great all the food was  the only negative thing i can say is that the customer service needs some attention 
food was really good and afordable! we got rice cakes  xiao long bao  fried udon  spicy beef and tripe  and 2 beers and it came out only to about $35  noisy any chinese restaurant  but the service was fast and they were nice  a bit of a wait though since it is a popular place  cash only 
i was expecting the line to be ridiculously long but i got lucky and got some seats  i think the best time to go there is around 4 where it's a little earlier than dinner time or you just have to get lucky  i came here to get some xiaolongbao and i have eaten xiaolongbao and many different places  i thought this was going to be the best one i've had but it wasn't! it was still good though  i also had the scallion pancake with sliced beef because that was something new to me  it was actually pretty good and the flavor was nice! it was just a little oily though but i do recommend to try it 
i love soup dumplings and this is the spot to have them  they are so delicious  but be careful the soup can be extremely hot  they offer either pork or pork with crab soup dumplings  i always go for the crab  they are the tastiest  i've also tried the spicy beef noodle soup  oh so yummy  the beef is so tender and the noodles freshly made  the noodle soup is so filling  i usually share it with another person  it does get busy however the wait is not long maybe 5 10 mins at most  definitely make sure to bring cash since it is cash only  they offer refills in tea just dont hesitate to ask  the staff is friendly and the decor is simple  the food speaks for itself  utterly delicious 
when i first got to know dtf  i thought to myself  this is the best xlb i've ever had  then i moved to the city and got to try shanghai cafe  i thought that was the best xlb i have ever had  well  now that i have tried nan xiang  this place   hands down   has the best xlb xlb costs only $5 5 here  half of the price tag when compared with dtf  but it gets better from there  the individual xlb portion is comparably bigger  if you let the xlb cools down a bit and stuff it in your mouth in one bite  you will be at the happiest place on earth  no  not disneyland  i came here for lunch and was delighted to learn that breakfast items were still available  i tried the hot soy bean curd and it was freaking delicious  i couldn't believe it! so freaking good!my only "complaint" is that i don't really know why its cold appetizers are priced much higher than other menu items  i got the beef tripe and it was over $7  they were pretty generous with the dish amount but i still found it slightly expensive the service was good  the restaurant is huge and can seat lots of people  i will be back for sure!
delicious food! i am shanghainese  and would definitely say this place is worth trying out for the most authentic shanghai food in the area! beats joes shanghai  i (and my mother who is a shanghai native) can guarantee you  $5 95 for 6 soup dumplings is also one of the best deals you'll ever find  you cannot come here without trying the soup dumplings!!
you know some place is special when you've eaten there weeks ago and you keep dreaming about it day after day till you start messaging people you don't even like to go with you to eat there  ugh  i'm so hungry now  this has one of the best fcking dumplings i have ever eaten  pan fried yo  and xiao long bao? two kinds   normal pork and pork and crab  ahhhh it has so much tears of joy soup inside  beats nyc chinatown any day  joe's shanghai? more like no shanghai  go here  it's better  and they can also wrap that stuff up frozen if you order in advance  i'm going to order 1000  and then i will warm one dumpling up each day till i run out 
i went there again last week since it was the only place opened at 9 30am  i had their salty soybean milk which was ok  their claim to fame    crab pork dumplings were really sad  the dumpling skin was thick and crude but the worse is the lack of dumpling soup and flavor  there was absolutely no crab flavor! it was so disappointing to waste a meal in flushing  i got an order of their kau fu from the cold appetizer section to go which has been good in the past  while the flavor was fine  i found a piece of black plastic in the food  yuck  hope i didn't consume any  there are so many better places to spend your money and meals in flushing  i do not recommend this one 
came to this restaurant with a friend because we were both craving buns for a while  needless to say  it satisfied both our cravings!we were quickly seated since the restaurant is pretty spacious! staff and waitress were also nice we ordered scallion pancakes with beef (a definite must)  pork buns  and crispy noodle with beef  they were all delish and not too oily or greasy  the food came out in a timely manner despite the busy lunch time definitely coming back here again and trying the other food on the menu!
best shanghainese food in queens their soup dumplings  scallion pancake with beef and cucumber are must orders they also have good noodle soups  as well their only downfall long waits and if you're not chinese or asian  it is a struggle to get a table  you must be very aggressive 
what was ordered 1  steamed pork bun2  crab meat pork bun 3  shao mai4  rice cake w shredded pork & preserved mustard5  spicy beef and tripewe're rating this restaurant entirely on food  if you're particular about service  then maybe this isn't the best chinese restaurant for you  also  the place is small and locals eat here  so expect to wait for a table  once you've ordered  the food comes out in a timely manner  the food is great! flushing is the place for chinese   you can rely on this place to give you only the best  we recommend trying  my personal favorite  the rice cake with shredded pork & preserved mustard  it's packed with flavor and you are sure to enjoy the rice cake texture  this place is known for their xiao long bao (soup dumplings) so  don't leave without having one  we really wished they had a bigger drink selection though  @thehungersons
i was looking for some knock dead xiao long bao and found this location at the top of the list arrived there at 1 00 pm on a tuesday  it is caddie corner on same street the new hilton is located in flushing  this should tell you street parking is non existent  so good if you find parking in parking lot either across street if lucky  or better three blocks up where there is a massive two story garage which is usually also a challenge to find a spot small cafe sized location  i should have known there was going to be an issue when they were handing out wait numbers  not good if you have to get back to the office from lunch on time  so what am i saying? think sardine can  where people had to wait outside because it was so crowded waiting inside wait staff need some training in courtesy  since we were not able to get a seating we ordered take out   we decided to eat elsewhere but i had to try their claim to fame  one order of xiao long bao   you will wait 15 minutes!!! okay  i bit the bullet and waited  i kid you not when within that long 15 minute wait i watched four    four separate groups of people walk in  were told they had to wait  and then just went elsewhere  wow! really popular  but they weren't willing to wait as us smucks finally got the xiao long baos ~$7+ it was a fair amount perhaps 6 8 (don't remember)packaged properly  came with sauce  chop sticks and napkins without having to request getting back to office after we had lunch at asian jewels around corner   wait was 2 3 minutes  i tried out the baos  here's my verdict decent  but there is place along side lirr that is a bit better and the wait is not so insane   and what you get is much better  not worth waiting 15 minutes for a take out  and certainly the 20  30 minutes it will take you to get seated if you are on a schedule don't trust the reviews  they must have had someone pad it  my patience  taste buds  wallet and ability to find street parking validates a honest and straight forward assessment on this particular experience at this specific time period bon appetite
i've gone here since i was a baby and would only be able to eat the silken tofu with honey for breakfast! this place holds near and dear to my heart because over the years i've grown up with craving these soup dumplings time and time again  with more soup dumpling places opening up in flushing  now there's really no need to go here only but i still choose to because it's a part of me  the quality has gone down i must say unfortunately but i also know how hard it is to keep up with demand and rising costs for food and rent in an area that is developing with dessert fads and slow gentrification  they have expanded over the years to include the space from the two restaurants they neighbor because lines would be out the door regardless of what time you try going there  the soup dumplings are still hand made behind the register in front and it salvages the authenticity of what i grew up on with my parents coming here and needing a booster seat
can't believe how rude and how unprofessional their waiters is! it took me forever to wait till one of the waitress came to order my food  then once she order she told another waitress that she forgot what i had order and told her to come oder my food again 
nan xiang xiao long bao has continued to do a phenomenal job at satisfying my soup dumpling cravings as well as many classic asian snacks such as scallion pancakes  fried dough and top it all off with soy milk  i highly recommend trying some cold side dishes  fried bean gluten which is comes with shiitake mushrooms and bamboo shoots and everything in this side is extremely flavorful as it has probably been marinating for a while! if you like spice and spicy  definitely try the spicy beef tripe bursting with szechuan peppery goodness! it has been over 5 years since my first review of this amazing soup dumpling spot and the soup dumplings are still bursting with flavor and the perfect ratio of skin to meat to soup  not the best soup dumplings but definitely the best queens has to offer  i also recommend trying the wontons in spicy peanut sauce as it is very flavorful and the peanut sauce is great!
stopped here on a whim  and boy was i glad i did! everything looked and smelled fantastic  and the soup dumplings are some of the best i've had in town  i will definitely be back soon!
i have been to this restaurant for breakfast and lunch for some time  the vegetable dumplings are so good that i have it evwrytime i was there  but the cashier was always busy with the phone orders  besides this  this place was good for chinese dumplings 
had the opportunity to visit this restaurant on the last view visits out in nyc and food has always been consistent   the soup dumplings were nice on a cold night and also tried the beef noodle soup  which was okay   as with any asian restaurant  come for the food and affordability and disregard the customer service 
i called in to order take out for my pregnant wife  i was on hold the first time for 17 minutes no one took my order  i called back and the host who picked up the first time answered again  her name was amina  she was very rude and said that the restaurant was busy and put me on hold again  i was on hold another 15 minutes and was cut off  i call back one more time and amina answers again i tell her i was cut off  in a aggravated tone amina quickly say please hold  i'm now on hold for the third time  a gentlemen named jose picks up and takes my order literally walk into the restaurant  there's no line and very few customers dining in the restaurant  i ask to speak to the manager  a women walks up to me doesn't tell me ( i later as jose  he tells me her name is kate) her name  i make my complaint  she says "oh that's not acceptable and basically brushes me off  i shock the your key staff members are so rude  i found my experience to be extremely unpleasant  and if not for my wife's crazing i would have said forget it and cancel my order   i don't think i well spend my money else where in the future  this is a poor representation of the cheesecake factory brand  do better cheesecake factory
i was here on a friday night with two friends  we waited twenty minutes for a table  not bad of a wait  i can't say much about this restaurant  i had the steamed vegetable dumplings and thought it was really good  it was generously stuffed with vegetables  i also had the beef scallion pancake  i though the beef scallion pancake was good  the sliced beef was lean and had savory brown sauce over it  coming from someone who is more of a vegetable fan than a meat fan  i wish it had more scallions on it  service was okay  i wish i had my tea refilled more often 
attentive service for tea refills and the scallion pancakes were very tasty  ate alone and  scallion pancakes and steamed pork dumplings were more than i could handle  nice price at $12 
small yet great menu  the soup dumplings with crab and pork are great! could eat them everyday! also had the scallion with beef! amazing! ordered fried pork  didn't think it came out so soft and yummy and just perfect!  will definitely come back soon!
awesome dim sum place! obviously anyone who knows dim sum  the prices are just ridiculous for the quality and amount of food you are getting  we ordered three and were completely stuffed and struggled to finish  the crab meat and pork steam buns  the pan fried pork and the pork in spicy peanut sauce free tea and fast service  would easily come back after a mets game 
this review is just for what i ate on that day    need to come back to try other dishes  after watching so many china' & taiwan's drama  i wanted to eat crullers and drink fresh soy milk   crullers  fried  not sweet  just taste like dough and oil hot fresh soy milk  light taste  couldn't stop drinking it    it's better than the one from the box    cash only!clean place!nice service!
must have soup dumpling    love the spicy cold beef and tripe appetizer   their rice cake is great and shredded pork noodle is must   
made the hike out to flushing from the uws and ordered 6 pork and 6 pork & crab soup dumplings  the hike was completely worth it as both were great  however  next time i go back  i will stick with just the pork and crab because there was something more flavorful and delightful about the broth  i also had a beef dish  but my friend ordered it and didn't catch the name  i thought it was good  but not as good as the soup dumplings! i can't wait to go back for those 
great yelp find! dishes come out super fast and everything was delicious!! obviously order the crab pork xiao long bao   soup dumplings  they're amazing! we got there around 6 30pm and only waited 5 mins  when we left the line was around the corner!
their soup dumplings and their scallion pancakes were delicious! this was my first time coming here but it did not disappoint  my only complaint was that i wish the staff was more attentive  we were there for about 45 mins but they never refilled our tea or came by to ask how our food was  that being said  the food was very tasty!
so juicy and yummy  recommended by friends and ended up here  didn't regret  the soup dumplings are really good  too bad i can't eat any gluten  regardless  i ate the soup and the meat inside  still very delicious 
things you need to know   if you like soupy dumplings and have never been here  do yourself a favor and go now   their soupy dumplings will lead to pure ecstasy   definitely get the beef scallion pancake   i made the mistake of going there on a saturday for brunch and the wait was ridiculously long   service is not excellent  you'll get your order eventually i honestly cannot get over their soup dumplings  there has been times when i craved it so much that i dined there like three consecutive times 
folks  if you're on a budget  this place is a must  not only is it incredibly delicious and filling  it's so cheap  the only guilt you'll feel when you leave is from being a glut  there were 4 in our group and with tax and tip  we all left feeling very full for only $10 each i had bookmarked this place exactly a year to the day before i dined here last night  that totally wasn't planned but i thought it was funny how things work out sometimes  i was in the area after watching the mets opening watch game at citifield and suggested this place because it was the closest venue from all my other bookmarks  but i digress  let's talk about the food if you didn't know  nan xiang is known for their soup dumplings and judging by their ever creeping expansion  it looks like they know a thing or two on the subject  they initially started off as a single space but took over the spaces on both their right and left  creating a three room restaurant  unfortunately  their menu isn't very vegetarian friendly but i did manage to find a couple of things i could eat  the meat packed soup dumplings were out of the question for my plate so i'll leave it to you to rely on the hundreds of other reviews recommending them  instead  i'll advocate to the small number of vegetarians who knowingly walk into restaurants with a 99 9% meat based menu with their carnivore companions  and boldly ask the waitress* (who believes scallions are a type of meat) if there's anything else that doesn't contain meat  *to her credit  she did warn me about the shrimp powder that's in a lot of the foods that doesn't list meat in the description they were out of the obvious choice  steamed vegetable dumplings  so i settled on youtiao (kind of like a long flaky doughnut   so very good that i ate as is without dipping into the sweet soy sauce)  cucumber & garlic (they forgot to add cilantro in the description  which was the best part!) and shanghai pan fried u don sans meat but with extra bokchoi (they did not give me extra bokchoi!) 
i came here a few days after trying joe's shanghai (granted that was around 11pm) and my first reaction is that it's much better than joe's shanghai  it could be that my last experience was late at night but the xlb was less dry on the outside and the other dishes we tried were pretty good as well  however  they were oily and overly salty in canto style  our server was nice and patient and we had no problem with the service or the speed  there were plenty of other non asians eating at the place on a weekday at noon  my only complaint is that the other customers were a little loud 
i've came here multiple of times during the day and the their soup dumplings and noodle dishes were really good  there's always a wait line when you come here in the afternoon and peak time  their prices are not too expensive either which is a plus! one night  i was craving for soup dumplings after my classes and one of my friend told me it was open until late  i really had no idea and i was excited to go because i haven't had soup dumplings for a while  the restaurant was pretty empty (only two other parties) and the person at the front had be waiting for about five minutes to be seated    meanwhile she was busy talking to her friend  like really? you could have at least seated us first  there were multiples of tables open  but the waiter wanted my boyfriend and i to sit next to another pair of couple  i get it that you don't want to have to wipe down an extra table at the end of the day   but    really?! i don't think that couple would appreciate such company when there are tons of other seats  i would like my personal space also  anyhow  we ordered soup dumplings and the shanghai fried noodle  my excitement for soup dumplings was thrown down the drain when i took my first bite  ( all our dishes were definitely not fresh  the soup dumplings were not hot and the noodles were cold and hard  it tasted like they microwaved the plate of food and brought it out for us  not tasteful  i was very disappointed  on a regular basis  i will definitely give this place at least a four star because their food are actually really delicious and yummmyyyy! but this night experience was very unpleasant and threw me off  i'll definitely know next time to not come back at night 
i was in the area and was looking for some xiao long bao  the service is really lacking in this place  the waiter had to be flag down to get refills on beverages  our food came out fast  we ordered pork xiao long bao ($5 75) which was very standard  i highly recommend the shanghai pan fried u don which was really amazing  the dish has great favor making  it stand out from other dishes  the pan fried dumpling ($6 50) took longer then the other dishes  the pan fried dumpling was okay but the dumpling skin was very thick and greasy  i would avoid ordering this dish at this location  it was my first time ordering the scallion pancake with sliced beef was good  i highly recommended this dish as well  the scallion pancake covering the beef was very thick  the slicked beef was delightful overall  meh  i would probably come back in the future
we used to love this place but it looks like the ownership chef changed because everything here is super salty  oily  and full of msg   our pork chop noodle soup had a few pieces of wilted bok choy  stale pork chop  and cloudy soup base with enough salt & msg to make you gasp for water   the noodles were meh   the stir fried rice cake with pork was undercooked  oily  and had black burn marks   at least the soup dumplings were passable   but you can definitely taste the extra salt & msg   go elsewhere for your soup dumpling fix 
maybe there have been changes in their kitchen team? came back for dinner recently after not having passed by in a long time  the dumplings are just not the same anymore   thicker skin  not as much juice  still well worth for the price though!
had the seafood udon noodle  very tasty and filling  service was quick even on busy sunday eve and reasonably priced  looking forward to the freshly fashioned dumplings i watched them make
3 things you must try  the soup dumplings   小笼包  spicy beef and tripe   夫妻肺片  and the scallion pancakes with beef  their service was great  the food were authentic  and the price is reasonable  the soup dumplings were super juicy  one of the the best i've ever had! i would highly recommend this place!
i don't think i've have such delicious soup dumplings for a very long time!! i was starting to get bored of all the soup dumplings i've had at most places   but then  my sister took me to nan xiang dumpling house!!! the skin is perfectly thin but chewy (how is that possible  you ask? i don't know how they did it either!)  and the soup inside of the dumpling was plentiful and flavorful  good sized  and came out quickly  we also tried their chives & egg fried bun (i think that's what they called it)  it's also one of the best ones i've had  even better than the one my dad makes at home (shh   )! those are the two dishes that dazzled me most  i also tried their spicy wontons  but those were less than mediocre  it was very plain  so we ended up putting a bunch of soy sauce and vinegar with the wontons  not what you're supposed to do   but oh well  like all restaurants  they have good and not so good dishes  you just have to know which ones to order!
this place is my family's  friends and boyfriend spot to go too! we love their soup dumplings mixed with crab meat and pork  their sautéed vegetables  shredded pork  dessert dumplings  their soups and their customer service is great! i love this place  on the weekends you may encounter a wait  it's a small place but amazing !
order from a menu  not from rolling carts   made fresh to order but very quick very good soup dumplings   scallion pancake with beef outrageous  server was very helpful  efficient  friendly and spoke perfect english   hand made dumpling very good   cash only   absolutely worth a try   we'll be going back   four star experience elevated to five since their prices are so reasonable 
just got hired at a job in flushing and  being that i am the unofficially appointed caucasian 6god of asian cuisine  i couldn't be happier to work in flushing  as a self proclaimed non shitty human foodie  i was eager to try this spot out  i'm from seattle  and i think soup dumplings were invented there like a year or two ago there  so excuse my prior ignorance  the place has no english signage on the exterior  so i struggled walked past it  giving a confused look into google maps yet pretending to know where i was going  definitely walked by it  then walked by it again  then found it  that being said  places without english signage are usually the real fuckin deal  it's like either it's going to be a good  authentic restaurant  or maybe a massage parlor where a shorty will play with your dillz at the end of the massage i couldn't really understand the menu  but i know eddie huang said to just order the soup dumplings  so i just asked for "soup dumplings" and was rewarded  having never tried soup dumplings  i googled "how to eat soup dumplings" which led me to watching a fat white guy tell me (a skinny white guy) how to eat this chinese dish  i mean cuz really only a white person would search that  let alone make a video tutorial  whatever man  i searched it  anyways  shit was pure  scorching hot greatness  i sat at the table for a moment after my first bite  basking in the glory of my present lituation  you already know i mass texted the photo i took to all of my non asian friends in an effort to flex and claim my spot on the throne of white people who eat cool food aka i'm a fucking herb oh also  they don't take card  so i had to walk to the nearest atm which is hella far  that's a pretty shameful walk imo 
very good dim sum  we ordered so much food  loved the soup dumplings! the prices were great!  very well worth the travel from brooklyn to flushing!   )
food is good  but the waitress would not let people sit down when they have plenty of empty tables  trying to create a sense of popular  very stupid management style  waste of time
hole in the wall place  doesn't look pretty but the food was amazing  i was visiting the area and ate here twice!
the pork crab soup dumplings and rice cake with shredded pork and shanghou mai were all amazing!!
soup dumplings and the soy milk were the only things that are decent   nothing special the chive pie and the udon middle were so oily   the pan fried pan bun were doughy and thick   not worth it cash only   services were lacking and the servers were playing on their phones 
nan xiang xiao long bao makes the soupiest soup dumplings i have ever had  i went on sunday afternoon  around 2 3  and the line was still out the door  the wait time itself wasn't too bad since people don't linger after finishing their food  it seemed that everyone was drawn to the restaurant by rumors that these soup dumplings rival  or even trump  those of joe's shanghai  by the time we were seated  i was famished  we ordered the regular pork soup dumplings  husband and wife tripe  scallion pancake with sliced beef and baby cucumbers  all of the portions were extremely generous the tripe was extremely flavorful  it certainly didn't lack any spices  there was also a lot of beef slices  most cucumbers are just dumped in garlic sauce and lack flavor but these baby cucumbers were definitely marinated  scallion pancake is an all time favorite dish of mine and i'm a firm believer that meat makes everything better  naturally  i ordered this  it turned out to be a little overwhelming  merely because of how large the portion was and how much meat they gave us  three slices ended being super filling  the pancake was thick to begin with and then stuffed with meat  as for the soup dumplings  i can't decide who has the better soup dumpling between nan xiang and joe's but i am certain nan xiang has more soup and more filling  overall  it was a very filling meal and great value for the price another great tip is that if you want any of the food from other restaurants  you can order it and have it delivered to your table because the owner owns all the joints in the block 
all the things are so so compared to me  and i came during a busy hour  but that doesn't give them an excuse to just make the udon soup literally taste like they put some water in it  not only that but they only give about 3 small pieces of beef for my beef pancake  and not only that  but some of the things are dirty too(utensils and cups) 
came here for a late dinner around 11pm on a saturday night  we thought the restaurant was closing at midnight but it closed at 1am  the restaurant was very busy throughout our entire meal  pros    all of these dishes tasted amazing  beef pan fried noodles  pork soup bun  crab meat soup bun   i personally liked the pork soup buns better   we all agreed that the hot soymilk drink tasted better than the cold one  and it was cheaper by 50 cents  it's less sweet than the cold one  cons   one coed bathroom   the scallion pancake was going to take 30 min so we didn't wait for it
no doubt the best place for xiao long bao  the only drawback is that i only like their xiao long bao  the rest is just so so   
first timer here on a saturday with my group of friends after a late run  we got here at around 11 30pm 12am  it took a while to get us seated since there were still many people that late  the staffs weren't rude but they weren't the nicest either  after getting seated  we ordered and the waiter that took our order decided not to write any of our orders down which included 2 cold and 2 hot soy milk  4 soup dumplings (xiao long bao)  noodles and scallion pancake  the soy milk came quickly and it was so delicious  i highly recommend their soy milk on hot or cold  then 2 batches of soup dumplings came  it was very flavorful and delicious  after receiving and finishing the first 2 batch of soup dumplings  we waited a long time wondering if the waiter had forgotten the other 2 batches  turns out he didn't even get the order right  we even cancelled the scallion pancake off the list because he forgot that too  we weren't going to wait another half an hour for be scallion pancake since it was close to closing 
i was really excited to come here and taste the food but i have to say i was disappointed with the service  taste and cash only option  i won't be back 
ok i'm a foodie  so this review + rating is independent of my thoughts on the service  soup dumplings are ok  nothing to get mindblown over  scallion pancakes were definitely good  other things to try  the pan fried udon is good  as well as the pan fried rice cakes  all in all  this place doesn't really live up to the hype if i were to give a review on the service  they get 0 stars  awful service  sometimes they blatantly ignore you waving your hand at them  recommendation  normal xlb  and go to kung fu xlb instead 
people say you are what you eat  but i don't remember eating disappointment  i came here for xiao long bao  but the skin was too thick and they are not juicy  however  their other dishes are good and the portion is just right 
the subway trip from manhattan to flushing is approximately 45 minutes to an hour  are the xiao long bao (xlb) at nan xiang dumpling house worth this commute? hell yeah they are  after having xlb in california  the dmv  and many  many times at joe's shanghai  i can confidently say nan xiang's are the very best  the skins are not too thick and not too thin; flexible enough to hold the soupy filling  but never cracking  the pork and crab filling is flavorful and plentiful  the dumplings  themselves  are the plumpest i've seen; it takes at least four    yes  four    sips to finish all the soup in a dumpling  anywhere else  only two  i had a chance to try one of their traditional taiwanese breakfast items  chinese donuts (not like american donuts at all) and hot unsweetened soy milk  i did not think this was worth having again  save your stomach space for dumplings only! nearby are large taiwanese malls with amazing food courts  so the long commute to flushing is definitely worth it if you start early and have at least three hours to kill  that way  you can have breakfast and lunch! i'll definitely return here on subsequent nyc visits 
great for that "late night" dining experience (( scenario  you're out on a saturday night  have had a little too much to drink  or maybe just a mere a sip of your whiskey sour  and you leave the bar say at 12 30am  dang  i'm hungry you think to yourself   but lo and behold  there's not a single place open at this time of day  and you're not craving the all you can eat hot pot down the street    but then    bang  there it is  xiao long bao you step in   already you smell the soupy delicious awesome goodness   and you think to yourself is    hell  freaking  yes  lets do this  ))need i say more? their xiao long bao really are soupy deliciousness  perfect for those nights where you just want something warm and gratifying after a night of (potentially) questionable calls side note  a bit chilly if you're sitting in the room where everyone enters and exits  wasn't because of the door being opened and closed  maybe it was the air conditioning system  or maybe i'm just constantly chilly 
the best soup dumplings in town  i usually get soy milk with it during the summer time but just beware cause sometimes it goes bad before they give it to u last time i had to exchange it cause it gave a funny aftertaste and the replacement was from the same batch and i just kept it and didnt drink it  the waiters arent that attentive but at the same time i dont really care cause im there with my friends and usually they give us what we need before walking away
amazing and so reasonable! 4 of us eat quite a bit and the bill was $46 + tip  great tripe  fried pork buns  udon noodles and crab and pork dumplings!
love their service  very kind and quick  scallions pancakes are delicious  and gotta say  the soup dumplings are one of the best in ny  gonna go back here more and try more stuff  )
this is my favorite restaurant in flushing! my go to place especially in the winter for the soup dumplings  i love love love their xiao long bao! freshly made and relatively quick  however  there is always a long line  but it's definitely well worth it  always satisfy my soup dumpling cravings  also recommend their shanghai noodles and dumplings!
this is a great place to visit if you want to try some authentic chinese food  the food here is delicious  and there's a great variety of food  with traditional dishes that originate from all parts of china  some of the dishes are small and relatively cheap  so you can try a bunch of them 
they gave me a fake 5 dollar bill  some girl who worked september 13  around 630pm  i asked for change of 5 dollars and they gave me a fake 5 dollar bill  i'm am so upset  don't go here they pass on fake money
delicious   soup dumplings  salty soy milk  and sticky rice log   yum yum yum   would definitely come back and try the other items 
i will come to this place again and every time thereafter when i'm forced to visit this overpopulated neighborhood  the beef and chili noodle soup is spicy af so beware (but still so good)  soup dumplings (classic) on point  the end 
love this place! seriously  if you are in search of xiao long bao then you have found it! the wrappers are so delicate and thin which makes the meat soup the real focal point of the dumplings! free hot tea upon being seated  smiling servers  a price point that is on the mark (under $6   for the pork) if you are taking the time to yelp this place specifically looking for "soup dumplings" then do not hesitate and go!
stop overhyping this place  i mean for those of you who give this place 5 stars  have you ever had real good soup dumplings in your life? if you ever had real legit soup dumplings or any real good chinese breakfast in china  you will know everything this place offers are merely average at the best  i mean i've been to this place a couple of times and it never impress me in any way  don't get me wrong  their dishes are not bad tasting or horribly wrong in any way  but seriously  if you think this place is good  then most of restaurants in flushing would receive 5 stars  branch out and try different things  for example  kung fu xiao long bao offers better soup dumplings  and red bowl noodle soup offers better breakfast menu  they are all on main street  try them now  you can thank me later   d
this is one of my favorite places to get xiao long bao  both regular pork and the crab pork mix are great  i love their scallion pancakes too  can sometimes be a little oily  but so good wait time can be a bother depending on when you come  weekends are hard  and it's cash only so make sure you hit up the atm beforehand parking is the worst in flushing  so good luck if you're trying to come here on a friday night 
i'd have to say i had high expectation for this dumpling house because of its popularity  i got the crab and pork soup dumpling pan fried pork dumpling  spicy beef and tripe  cucumber and garlic  fried bean gluten  soy milk  and pork chop noodle soup for around 43 bucks total  beware  it is a very small appetizer portion except for the soy milk and pork chop noodle  the dumplings come in 6 pieces for around 7 bucks and everything else on the menu is around 7 9 bucks  overall favorite  spicy beef tripe and i wish they have bigger portiondumplings  both dumplings were alright  i expected more flavor and nice texture to the skin but it was just like any other dumplings i've tasted  crowds  it got crowded during weekend nights!
this restaurant used to be decent with dependable service and a friendly staff  it has gone only downhill since then  as i am writing this  i am still waiting for my shao long baos  it's very depressing when you arrived before everyone around you and everyone has paid and left before you  the staff is less than lackluster at best  upon multiple friendly reminders of my missing dishes  the staff continued to focus on her other tables (it's was only 12 30pm mind you  a time where shao long buns are not craved by the general asian population)  i left hungry and will go to another more respectful place that places their customers first 
are the soup dumplings better than joe shanghai's? prob on par  but the rest of the food is so much better  i have been here at least 10 times and i have always been pleased with the meal here  the other stuff at joe's is very mediocre  flavors are definitely white washed  i love the fact that this restaurant expanded a long time ago  the waits here were always crazy and rightfully so the food steamed pork buns  this is the reason you come here  i prefer the original over the crab addition  i feel the crab doesn't offer much in terms of flavor nor texture  the dumplings are excellent  they are dumplings filled with a pipping hot broth that you slurp before you consume the dumpling  there is also a vinegar ginger dipping sauce that cuts the richness of the dumplings quite well  yelp com user_local_phot…scallion pancake with sliced beef  i like the flavors of this dish but it tends to run on the oily side  it's a scallion pancake with slices of beef  hoisin and scallions  kinda reminds me of peking duck  but with beef  the oil magnifies even more when it gets cold  i like this dish but it can be tweaked  also  the pancake is pretty on the thick side and it's filling as shit! yelp com user_local_phot…spicy beef & tripe  i really like this dish a lot  it's kinda like a spicy beef and tripe salad  the beef and tripe are super tender and the flavors are explosive  this dish is awesome with beer  yelp com user_local_phot…spicy beef tendon  it has the color of a nuclear orange  it's kinda weird looking but the flavors are nice  the tendon is tender and unctuous and the chili oil complements the tendon well  it's a good  not great dish  yelp com user_local_phot…pan fried pork dumplings  i was pretty happy with the pan fried  the bottom was crunchy and the filling was juicy  i was really happy with this pan fried pork buns  seems like the general trend is all the pan fried dishes are oily and this dish is no different  the flavors of the dish are good but i thought the bun had too much dough pork & vegetable wontons in spicy sauce  this dish was kinda weird for me  the wontons are boiled  then put in a bowl with chili oil and some kind of sesame sauce that really resembled thinned out peanut butter  i didn't think the flavors went well together   i would skip this dish shanghai shao mai  this is not what you think of when you think of shumai  this sucker has pork and sticky rice  the sticky rice completely threw me off  i liked the fact that the dish is home made but i wasn't crazy about it seafood pan fried u don  i like this dish  it's a stir fried udon with bok choy  shrimp  scallop  fish etc  this dish is not an exciting dish and the flavors aren't explosive but it is a very solid dish  the chew of the udon and the flavors of the seafood with the combination of the soy work well rice cake with beef  i liked this dish as well  the rice cake offer a nice chewy dough with tender pieces of sliced beef and cabbage  it's not really a exciting dish but the flavors and textures are nice  yelp com user_local_phot…pork chop noodle soup  got this with the chop on the side  the pork chop is excellent  has great flavor and is super tender  the broth and the noodles are pretty straightforward  nothing too exciting really  yelp com user_local_phot…crispy noodle with seafood  a pretty standard pan fried noodle dish  it's pan fried noodles with a seafood gravy on top  it's a good dish  but nothing exciting really  yelp com user_local_phot…
came on a sunday late afternoon (around 11am) with 4 people and didn't have to wait  all the food came out very quickly but we had to wait for the pork buns and soup dumplings for a while  we ordered salty soybean soup 4 5sweet soybean soup 5 5oil stick 3 5beef in scallion pancake 5 5pork buns 5 5soup dumplings 5 5turnip cakes 4 5 5all of the dishes were really good; first time in flushing for dimsum and i enjoyed it a lot  the soup dumplings were as good as its hyped up to be  highly recommended  bill came out to $40 with tip and tax for 4 people 
i finally got to try the infamous soup dumplings! the pork and crab soup dumplings were delicious and hit the spot on a cold winter night  it was not as crowded for a friday evening as it normally is which is why my visit has been delayed for so long haha  the menu items are decently priced and not a overwhelmingly large selection  the service was okay  i could see some improvement in that area and also the service is not as fast and strangely inconsistent because tables next to us that come after us get their order of the same items earlier than us when we ordered earlier  sometimes they take the order via memorizing then forgot our order  but the staff is nice so they try to compensate for the inconsistency  the noodle soups are pretty tasty; the fish fillet goes well with the pickled cabagge which i would have never guessed to combine the two items in a noodle soup  the spicy beef soup was flavorful and hit the spot  i think i will try the other small side dishes next time since many people seemed to order it and enjoy it  remember it is cash only so definitely prepare for that 
ultra crowded on friday around 4pm  long wait for food  got the beef scallion pancakes and soup dumplings  the beef was inedible   all fat and gristle  the pancake itself was good  the soup dumplings were fine  pretty standard  overall  the food was not worth the wait or money ($14)  this place is overrated 
loveeeeeeee dis place  omgah  my stomach wants dumplings now lol  i wish they had another establishment in texas  came to eat here my 1st time while visiting nyc during winter break and it was so damn good    mmm  ordered pork soup dumplings  scallion pancake  and was it pork fried dumplings?? i forgot   i need to go back and look at my nyc pics   the soup dumplings = on point  idk how they per fect it  but kudos to them  just because they are "small"   don't underestimate the power of those dumplings because you will get full! scallion pancake didn't disappoint either  i love the crispness and greasiness  cash only!!!! they also serve you hot tea  ) you will not regret coming here 
i highly suggest nan xiang if your looking for dim sum and small chinese dishes in flushing my favorite dish was the scallion pancakes with beef  they were crispy and delicious  i also liked the pork and vegetable wonton in a spicy soup  the soup sauce had a delicious nutty element too it  it was an unfamiliar taste for a soup  i really enjoyed it  it wasn't too spicy the service is fast  and the staff brings out your dishes as they're ready   so be careful  they might be hot!! the staff kept our tea and water cups filled an all around  great experience  i'm eager to go back and try other dishes like the pig ear  rice cakes  and jelly fish 
when you absolutely need to have traditional chinese food  with fast service  no need to look further than nan xiang xiao long bao  i had a simple meal of a scallion pancake with an order of steamed crab meat & pork buns  the food was traditionally prepped  and delicious  (be careful with the crab meat  pieces of shells are still in there ) for travelers  this restaurant is just a block away from the best western  hyatt place and sheraton hotels 
amazing authentic chinese food  definitely worth the trip  some of my favorites were the scallion pancakes  shanghai udon noodles  steamed and friend dumplings and pork buns  i can't wait to come back!
after eating soup dumplings at different establishments  i have to say this location is at the top of the list by far  flavourful  just the right amount meat soup ratio  & cheap (a good thing in my opinion)  their other dishes are incredibly delicious as well  my favorite go to's besides the dumplings  scallion pancake w  sliced beef cucumber w  garlic rice cake w  pork pork buns (the bottoms get nice & crispy mmm)there can be a wait  most i've waited was 15 20 mins   it really depends on when you go i've seen people order the crispy noodles as well so i want to give that a try next visit plus  they are michelin star rated   that has to be a good thing  right?the trek from brooklyn to queens is worth it 
best xiaongbao in flushing  still  i went for lunch this past saturday at 2p  surly dismissive service from host and waiters as is typical of flushing places thus a lot of the bad press  but go for the food instead  seating is very competitive but waits are short as the waiters hurry patrons in and out of their meals  lots of tourists and non chinese so it must be listed in tour books and sites  interior is bright and clean with high efficiency seating arrangement thus no privacy  nearly every table touches another  but a very large seating area and large glass windows makes it feel less claustrophobic than it might otherwise  service is partial english & certainly mandarin and preferably cantonese  ordering is straightforward with a bilingual menu with photos for all items  ingenuous way to handle the many tourists  all i need to say is they're perfect  the skin is thick enough to tolerate use but not to get in the way  we ordered 2 pork xiaolongbao's (6 per bin) and 1 scallion pancake  the soup inside is just right  a careful recipe of real chicken gelatin in it with nice filling  the scallion pancakes are fried right and not excessively greasy 
two out of five relative to the hype  the food and service arent really much more than a three out of five  they have a few dishes on the menu that are rarely found but the execution is just ok  xia long bao is just average  menu range is limited relative to other shanghai restaurants  there's better shanghai food across the street  imo 
my go to joint for xlb  food is cheap  filling  and delicious  no complaints on my end  other than the long lines during friday sunday brunch and dinner hours  service is pretty quick with no frills  nothing i have a problem with  for two people  two orders of xlb and one side is enough food to leave you feeling like the michelin man  i've never left nan xiang feeling less than stuffed  also  to the white guy who said he prefers joe's shanghai   nothing's stopping you from going to that tourist trap  bye  felicia!
cheap and tasty  it's a restaurant in flushing  i expect the bad service  i'll still return because the food was good 
all i want to say is  why can't they bring this over to the bay area? i have tried joe's shanghai and din tai fung from different locations  i like nan xiang the best!the dumpling is big and full of soup  you have to be careful to not have the soup drilling out of your spoon  they make it fresh after you order  we probably waited for about 20 minutes  i also found out that if you order equal or more than two different kinds of dumplings  they usually wait until all flavors are cooked then they bring them together to you  so if you see your next table neighbor got their dumplings first while they ordered a bit latter than you  don't worry  it's not that they forget about your order  it's that they are trying to be efficient and want to bring all your dumplings together all at once funny thing was  we went there on a saturday afternoon  there was a long wait  but the worker told me it was a 20 minutes wait  so i got my number  went to eat at the new food court for about an hour  then when we came back  we still waited 5 minutes for our table! so whatever the worker tells you about your wait time is not correct 
it's been 4 years since my last review and 4 years since i've been here  they have expanded so there was no wait when i arrived friday afternoon around 4pm  i ordered   pork soup dumplings  crab & pork soup dumplings  soybean soup with the long fried sticks of dough (not sure what the name is)  pork & cabbage noodle soup  scallion pancake with beefthe pork soup dumplings were delicious  just how i remember it  however  for a soup dumpling place and a shanghainese restaurant  they should know that shredded ginger is important to serve with the dumplings  they bring out a measly amount and when i asked for more  they gave again   a measly amount  the 'crab' and pork dumplings  tasted exactly like pork dumplings!!!! no sign of crab anywhere! that's when i asked the waitress whether it was crab & pork dumpling  she first says 'i dont know what that is' after showing her the inside of my dumpling  then she makes a remark saying that i ordered 'pork and crab' and i'm like i know  where's the crab? she responds by saying 'its not all crab   yea i know its not all crab  i was pointing out  where's the crab?? all i see & taste is the pork! did i get 2 orders of the pork dumplings??? the waitress starts muttering to the other waitress in mandarin that i clearly do not know what i ordered  mind you  i may speak shanghai dialect but i understand mandarin perfectly  by then  i gave up  there was no point in arguing with the chinese  going back to the food  the pork & cabbage soup was bland  i would not order again  scallion pancake with beef was a hit with the bf and i thought it was delicious too! there's def hoisin sauce in there  the soybean soup with the fried dough brings back childhood memories and was perfectly crispy & chewy at the same time! all in all  it is def not a 5 star establishment as i remember it to be  the pork dumplings are definitely good but if the pork and crab dumplings do in fact taste like the pork dumplings  just go ahead and order all pork dumplings  its not worth the extra dollar & confusion when they taste identical 
joe shanghai was my go to a few years back for soup dumplings    it's now my 2nd option   space is large enough for a big group  but they don't take reservations 
the soup dumplings both pork and crab are always delicious here  best rice cake with mustard cabbage in queens!
cash only  no debit  no credit  okay now let's talk  i loved it  i loved loved loved it! having been in the midwest for so long  it is so nice to be able to sit down and eat a legit xiao long bao (soup dumplings)  especially after taking over an hour to get here from a flight into la guardia (friday night traffic i suppose)  loved that there was seating right away  cuz this girl was dying to try this place! so i love how juicy and savory these soup dumplings were! the skin was well made too  both the pork and crab pork were deeee licious! the beef noodle soup was also legit  i wish i were related to the owner workers so i can eat here all day every day  behind the glass  you can see the ladies making these yummy little things  i can't wait to go back  next time i come to nyc i'll be back  no doubt about it! even with the 1 hour commute  but i'll wisen up   no more friday night landings into la guardia the only thing is the bathroom is not very clean  so  go to the bathroom before coming and eat your heart out and leave before needing to go is the moral i think 
made famous by eddie huang (vice is my jam)  this place lived up to its' hype  the couple times i've come here  it hasn't taken me longer than 5 minutes to be seated  the space  especially in the area right when you walk in to the restaurant is a bit cramped  but it is bearable the atmosphere is quiet  service is average  but the food is amazing  if you're like me and you enjoy being able to hear your friends speak over dinner  this is a great spot to come chill and enjoy some bomb xlbs i've had the crab and pork xlbs (soup dumplings)  the scallion pancake (w  and w o beef)  and a noodle soup  this is usually my go to spot just for soup dumplings so my review may be a bit narrow in variety  but these xlbs are delicious  the soup packs a punch  not too greasy  and full of flavor  the crab in my opinion is not really worth the extra buck because the flavor is so masked by the black vinegar (please stop poking holes into your xlbs)  on its' own  its alright  the scallion pancakes with beef are good as well  but may i recommend this    get the scallion pancakes  put sugar on them  then immediately access yelp  come back to this review  and thank me for making your life wonderful again  overall  it's quiet  dimly lit  and delicious  and theres a snowdays next door so you can cooldown with some dessert after!
really good food  dim sum etc     the place is always packed be prepared to wait 
i've had nyc's xlb once in manhattan's chinatown so i don't have much to compare nan xiang to but it's a solid four stars  we came on a sunday night with the hope of snacking our way through flushing so we only got xlb  sheng jian bao (pan fried)  and a green onion pancake  in order of my favorites   holy smokes  the green onion pancake knocked my socks off! it might be one of the best ones i've ever had   extremely crispy and chewy  light and airy  perfectly salted  great texture   xlb was great  though maybe not the best i've had  they're a bit doughier than what i'm used to (see richmond  bc) and there wasn't as much of that fatty porky flavor in the juice  still delicious but i wouldn't pick it as among my favorite xlbs  also we didn't get ginger   not sure if you have to ask for it but oh well   pan fried buns were good  not great  that's all i have to say all in all  nan xiang is good  worth checking out  but there are better shanghainese places in north america 
i've heard a lot of people say this is the best xiao long bao in ny so i've had this bookmarked for a while  and when my boyfriend and i went food hopping in flushing i made a point to include this stop  after all  my boyfriend have never had xiao long bao before  since we were already pretty full we only ordered a serving of xiao long bao  it was pretty late on a weekday night so it wasn't crowded and service was quick  the soup dumplings themselves were quite good but i have to admit it was a little overshadowed by everything else we ate beforehand  and i do need to revisit joe's shanghai and shanghai cafe before i once again decide which is my top pick out of the three  until then this place is getting 4 stars 
came here for the soup dumplings of course! i've never had to wait too long to be seated  and the food comes out pretty quickly  the soup dumplings are a good size  and have a great broth inside  they're thick enough that they won't rip when you pick them up  but thin enough so that they're not so doughy  cheap too! the place may not be immaculate  and the service is mediocre but that's normal for flushing  can't hate on it! even if you don't have much time  you can be in and out of here pretty quickly   they don't take much time giving you your check back when you're done with your meal (a pet peeve of mine)
shanghai pork soup dumpling are very good  not as good as din tai fung in california  a bit too big to be authentic rice cakes are average  too small and peppery scallion pancakes are very crunchy and worthy  not a lot of scallion flavorsoy milk and yau tiu are good cash only sucks 
worth the wait  usually a pretty fast turnaround time  love the fresh soy milk  the cold tripe and beef dish was delicious with the cilantro  highly recommend! best crab and pork soup dumplings i've ever had! the skin was super thin and the broth inside was very tasty  the fried dough was good but nothing special  the pan fried buns are another item i recommend to get  the scallion pancake with beef was ok  kinda dry 
this place had long wait time  but the service was fast  i mean they weren't the best at serving but their soup dumplings are good  they have good other dishes too  but i ordered 4 crates of soup dumpling with my friend sooooo     try it and you will see for yourself 
the soup dumplings here are amazing  and the prices are quite reasonable  most things on the menu are actually pretty good too  this is my favorite place to get soup dumplings aside from din tai fung  note that it will be pretty full around meal times but they do get people in and out somewhat quickly 
good food  good prices  xiaolongbao hits the spot  probably my favorite next to the not so average joe's  their other stuff is pretty tastey too  especially the beef wrapped in scallion pancake or the pan fried buns  you know what  close your eyes and point (defeats point of pictures on the menu)  i haven't had the soup noodles but it'll probably be good  they're always busy  so be prepared to wait  unless you're a really early bird  then try their breakfast  yum 
xiao long bao  bitch!this is legit as it can get  salute to eddie huang for putting me on this spot  we trekked all the way from the city for this on our last vacation and it did not disappoint make sure to walk around and look for the carts with beef tongue and other bomb ass skewers i am reminded of jin's infamous 106 & park freestyle friday battle when dining here  one of the realest ever  son was straight cold with the bars "had my eggrolls and my dumplings in her mouth!"
i don't see the hype surrounding nan xiang xiao long bao    don't get me wrong  their food is good  the one time i came here with my parents  we ordered the usual   crab meat soup dumplings and scallion pancakes  for me  if a chinese restaurant wants to impress me  make good scallion pancakes  if you can't even get this basic chinese staple correct  you've got no chance  on that note  nan xiang did not disappoint  their scallion pancakes are pretty good  but my parents and i  weren't so impressed with the soup dumplings  taste and quantity wise  we'd prefer joe's shanghai  i'd rather pay $7 95 for 8 delicious soup dumplings  than what they offer you at nan xiang  and overall  i prefer the menu at joe's shanghai 
i love this place  i usually get the pork dumplings and the scallion pancakes with beef  if you get there early enough  definitely try the soy milk  great place for cheap eats in flushing 
better than the soup dumplings in mainland  china imo  be prepared to wait in line if you come during a busy time 
l o v e plump full bodied soup dumplings!!! these xiao long baos are not shrivelled or mushy at all  an order comes with six mouth watering delicious hot dumplings  these dumplings are much bigger than the ones i've tried because they are filled with so much soup( great thing) !! the skin is thicker than i prefer but it holds in the soup so well and still remains delicate as a xiao long bao should  we ordered both the crab xlb and pork xlb  both were delicious but if i were to come alone and could only handle 1 order i'd say go for the crab xlb  other than their xlb  nan xiang looks like they also have a lot of other items that are worth ordering at ridiculously low prices  we ordered the jelly fish dish out of the cold items list and it did not disappoint  their soy milk is also something that you must try overall  absolutely delicious! home run! so good that i can disregard their c grade from the health department! there is absolutely nothing that will stop me from seeking out these little dumplings every time that i'm in town 
i'm late to post my review on this gem of place in my hometown of flushing  i have not returned home in 7 years and had list of restaurants i wanted to visit but after seeing the fung bros flushing food crawl  i knew i needed to eat here first  when you arrive you will be greeted by the groups of people waiting inside and outside to be seated  do not get in line you need to go inside and get a number  i waited about 25 min but it was well worth the wait  once inside it's very busy and you are immediately engulfed by the wonderful aromas and watching the waitresses brings towers of dim sum to the table near by   you are given hot tea with a small dish of ginger  i thought it was for my tea but it really it's for the soy sauce regardless the tea was good  i ordered xiao long bao which is pork soup dumplings  pan fried udon noodles and pan fried dumplings   the soup dumplings was everything i expected it to be  a hot soupy pork filled dumpling of deliciousness! i literally was in heaven! the udon noodles were delicious as well they had the right amount of sauce on it as was flavorful but the pam fried dumplings were standard as any chinese take out restaurant  i had no complaints about any of my dishes if you happen to be in flushing this is a must try  you won't regret it  i want to go back home just so i can go eat here again!
soup dumplings is what you get there  yes small place   could get crowded  the best kept secret in flushing  worth the trip  great prices
was a regular customer here for more than 6 years and just had the shitest customer service here  again  the receptionist with a million false lashes had no manner and even though the food was great and the price is reasonable i'd not give it another dine in experience  we stood in front of her waiting to be served but instead of turning back to look at us she continued chatting with others for two straight minutes  because my mom knew she was plain on ignoring us and told her we had 4 she said one word  "inside"  there's two sides and so it wasn't immediately clear where exactly we had to go so she rolled her fake looking barbie eyes to the left and repeated "inside" 3 more times  each time louder than the previous  i mean  come on  can't we hire some well mannered and educated receptionist?
what the restaurant lacked for in ambiance  they made up in flavor  prices were extremely cheap  and portions were large  i would reccomend the spicy wontons or the crunchy seafood noodles  would highly reccomend and go again 
great soup dumplings! among the best we've had love that xiao long bao is in the name of the place!
the soup dumplings are the bomb! so delicious! but the cups in which they serve the tea always look a little gross   i think it's time for them to order new ones 
the greatest soup dumplings in nyc!  better than joe's shanghai in chinatown by a mile     now they even expanded into a new extension so the wait is a lot shorter    highly recommended and try all of their other dishes too!
good dumpling place  i saw super high rate on yelp hoping for some amazing 小籠包it was good but not the kind i like  maybe it's just a different style  restaurant was rather dirty  just like typical chinese restaurant  it wasn't busy but the service was very slow (
so overrated  rainy weekday evening no line so we decided to stop in for dinner  haven't been in years because i always felt it was dirty here  the tables weren't greasy this time  but the food certainly isn't worth waiting on line for 
the food is spot on  the service isn't (as expected from any typical restaurant in flushing)  quite rude staff  but the orders come quick and precise 
one of my favorite places to get soup dumplings! they have really good stir fried rice cakes with pork  scallion pancakes with beef and cold soybean milk! there is always a line  but the food is worth it 
bye joe shanghai !! found my new favorite soup dumpling spot!i was surprised at how nice the employees were especially since asian restaurants are notorious for terrible customer service  p aside from the pork soup dumplings (i ate 3 to myself noms) you must order the garlic cucumbers  beef wrapped pancakes  and shu mai  ) the shu mai reminded me of the dim sum dish (lo mai gai) with sticky rice wrapped in a lotus leaf yum! i wish flushing wasn't so far from the city bc flushing food is so much better!!!
there is a good selection of authentic chinese food here   as other reviewers have mentioned  the soup dumplings are the main attraction here   the scallion pancakes are also quite good  not too greasy but also not too chewy as some other places' we went late at night and were seated instantly   have not been here during peak hours but i hear there is always a long wait   be warned that this establishment  like many others in the area  is cash only 
decent shanghai restaurant  we ordered a variety of small appetizers to share pork xiaolongbao   not sure if it's the absolute best  but one of the better ones  skin was a bit thicker but dumplings were full of soup spicy bamboo shoots   could have been a little more spicy spicy beef and tripe   well flavored and spiciness was just the right amount shanghai fried udon   noodles were a bit hard  but flavor was great  was a little bit oily  but not as oily as other places i tried glutinous rice shao mai   never had shaomai with glutinous rice before  but i would love to eat this again clean restaurant and staff always kept our tea cups filled 
totally disappointed with the *xiao long bao* here but enjoyed everything else we ordered    can't win all the time  can we?let's start off with the under par classic and most popular dish   #failures1   steamed pork buns   sigh!2   steamed crab meat & pork buns   sigh sigh!!the extra large xiao long bao kept breaking on us!!!  soft  thin layered skin   somewhat soggy on the bottom!  wth    the skin was too soft and sooooo thin that most of the xiao long baos easily popped with the soup leaked and spilled all over the place   so sad!!!  we were all being extra careful while picking the xl xiao long bao out of the steamer but nothing worked!!!  there was just too much soup inside!!!  if only they made the xiao long bao smaller than maybe it would've held it together properly like the way it should   the soup was more on the greasy and salty side   the meat was just ok   honestly  i didn't find this dish to be outstanding as per other yelpers   we didn't feel like eating it after awhile   unfortunately  my high overhyped expectations backfired   whyyyyyyyyyyyyy? *poutnow  all of the other dishes we ordered were much better   #winners3   scallion pancake   order it    order it   order it!  fluffy and crispy at the same time   filled with flavor   not greasy   fried perfectly   the best i've had so far!4   iced soy bean milk   sweet goodness!found it strange when the waitress asked my friend  "do you want iced or cold"?  errr  thought it meant the same thing?  lols5   pan fried dumplings   yum!  outer layer fried just right   tender meat   6 pcs were not enough!!!6   rice cake with shredded porksmall pieces   easy to chew   loved it   7   shanghai pan fried u donfood came out fast   fast service last note   maybe we'll come back and give their xiao long bao another try or maybe we'll just stick with kung fu xiao long bao since our first experience was so much better over there 
the soup dumplings are amazing! cheap and yummy for any group  i also really love the scallion pancakes  the beef scallion pancakes aren't my cup of tea  but my family loves it  i've been here quite a few times  but the reason why i took off a start was because of service  previous times they had staff members check on your table for tea or water  but yesterday the scallion pancakes came out before giving tea or water to the table 
this shit is the shit! yumsomeone needa bring this shit to cali cuz din tai fung aint got shit on this 
been here a few times and always order their soup dumplings and spicy beef and tripe  really like it! just don't bother getting their crab soup dumplings 
i love nan xiang and am always willing to make a hike from astoria to get my fix of soup dumplings for such an affordable price  the pork soup dumplings and scallion pancake is a must! all of the soups  noodle and rice cake dishes are definitely worth a try as well 
the food is good but not as good as joe's shanghai or shanghai cafe in chinatown  we tried several dishes  shanghai fried seafood noodles  crab meat soup dumplings etc 
food is pretty good dont get me wrong  but the shitty  service  and slow times  not worth it  other places have soup dumplings that are as good 
best xiao long bao place in flushing hands down! they have a simple and authentic menu that is very reasonably priced  that's why there's a line at this place at all hours of the day! and worth the wait every time  i love the soup dumplings and the scallion pancakes with beef inside!
best soup dumpling spot in queens  there's usually a line here but it goes pretty quick  usually get the original and seafood mixed  don't forget to use the sauce  the noodle here is great too  in case you aren't full from the dumpling 
i have been craving everything we ate since i came here i don't ever order chinese as i don't ever crave it   until now  omgthe soup dumplings were the best i've ever had  best scallion pancake i've ever had! love love loveeeeeed it!!
just simply wow  i was really a non believer three or four years ago in 010' 11' when i came  at the time  the soup dumplings were really small with barely any soup  but now they seriously keep stepping up their game! they've officially gained my last star nan xiang always had the better food as joe's shanghai's food well    just sucks  i recommend getting these at nan xiang's beef scallion pancake  so perfect and delectable  the outside skin has a perfect flaky crispy skin  then when you bite into it the pancake is soo soft with delicious beef fillings and the sweet sauce to cut the scallion and salty grease taste spicy beef & tripes  i can't handle a tad of spice at all it but i love this dish  the hot spicy oil flavor is soo great that it's worth me crying and burning my tongue over  also the beef cuts are my usual fave that i get at shanghai cuisines and at home (beef shank) and though i hate eating tripe due to my list of certain food phobia    but just yesterday my bf convinced me somehow to try it and he's right  you can't really tell or taste it's tripe  it's softer and tender than other tripes and just not creepy and icky the xiao long baos(soup dumplings) here are much soupier than joe's and they've even stepped up their crab meat too    but joe's still has more crab meat and crab taste in theirs  also nan xiang has a better put together skin  it's firm but delicate at the same time plus their skins not too thick  i also give props to them for being consistent! this place overall hits the spot for sure 
a lot of great reviews here  but even still  i wasn't impressed with the xiao lung biao  they were good with a very delicate skin and a good amount of soup in both pork and crab  but i think the ones at several other places are still better (joe's  shanghai heping  joe's ginger)   what bothered me was that those other places  for about the same price (+   $0 50)  you get 8 xlb's vs nx's 6 per order we also tried the rice cakes w  seafood and was mediocre   the scallion pancake w beef was tasty  but we should have ordered another   the pan fried pork buns were good  but again only 6 per order   after all this we were still hungry  so we ordered shanghai fried udon and pork & salted cabbage noodle soup   the udon was cooked with way too much soy sauce and not enough ingredients and the noodle soup was just meh with not a lot of ingredients either nan xiang is more of a shanghai snack bar (mainly breakfast & lunch) because their menu is not full fledged  lacking in any dishes you would serve for dinner   what chinese restaurant doesn't have rice dishes (fried or otherwise)?  even so  with all that we ate  the bill was just under $50 for 4  so it was still bargain eats 
probably the best soup dumpling spot in flushing  queens  the place gets pretty crowded but the wait is never too long  service could be better but the food makes up for it  scallion pancake with beef is a must! also  crispy dough and soy milk is bombdotcom if you're looking to get some chinese breakfast  overall  food is good  come here if youre ever in flushing 
delicious soup dumplings   the broth was so flavorful and the pork so tasty  we also got the udo noodles which were very good as well  a hidden gem!
this place is as good as described by my fellow yelpers  the pork and crab dumplings were delicious  as was everything else  alice our server was so nice and helpful  don't miss out 
honestly  i often live by "if you can't say something nice  don't say nothing at all"   thumper  there is a need for people to know what they might encounter going here  first  let's talk about service  we sat at the front of the room on the left side of the restaurant  we were a group of 5  not big nor small  you would imagine that it is unlikely that they would miss us right? took a few minute to decide on what we want  no one came to greet us  or give us water  that is fine  after we all have decided what we want  we noticed the server took orders from 2 tables that sat down after us  after a few more minutes  we cannot wait any longer for anyone to come take our order  so we waved called over a busboy  and requested him to please get our server here  so we can order  server came shortly after  and took our order  by the time the first appetizer came  water has arrived as well  it has been at least 20 minutes since we sat down  ordered 2 of the same appetizer  one came in the beginning  and the other one at the end  i have always been a fan of xiao long bao  and quite frankly i do not know how they are michelin recommended for so many years  seeing that many recommendation  i had high expectations walking into this restaurant  i was not impress surprise by their xiao long bao at all  i have had better at shanghai cafe deluxe on mott street  i can say that the rice cake with shredded pork and mustard plant was really good though!
i've been coming here for almost eight years now and it has always been my favorite spot in flushing  back then this was a homey restaurant  now it is another tourist attraction in queens the past few five times i've been here  the soup dumpling has been bland and tasteless  the crispy noodle is literally drenched with sauce and lettuce but barely any meat if you disagree with what i am saying  it's probably because you haven't tried the soup dumplings here 5 years ago despite its dip in quality  this place is still one of the better soup dumpling place in ny  but it's time for me to explore better options 
3 5 starsmy favorite place in nyc to get soup dumplings  they expanded the restaurant several months ago so the wait isn't as ridiculous as it used to be  however  fair warning  i saw there was a c health rating when i went to eat on christmas (says the woman who answered my call  "open 365 days")  and that is why i am taking off 1 5 stars  (if you can get past that (i really really hope that grade improves)  their soup dumplings or "xiaolongbao" are pretty darn good  the skin is thinner than joe's shanghai and not as sticky  and with careful maneuvering should not break on you  as a general rule  i always stick with pork  nothing with seafood  because i find seafood xiaolongbao always tastes fishy    and that's not delicious i also order the scallion pancake with beef  some warm soy milk (and for breakfast  fried dough for dunking)  and some cold dishes like "kao fu" (marinated tofu and mushrooms) and cucumbers  the stir fried noodles are standard and good for sharing  i like lao mein with chicken overall  this place has solid and reliably good shanghainese food  just get that grade improved and i would love to travel all the way to flushing on a weekly basis 
these soup dumplings rank among the best i've ever had in the world  including places in hong kong  the dumplings are just full of savory  tasty soup  when i try to eat the xiao long bao here in one bite  there's just an explosion of soup in my mouth and it's one of the greatest feelings  the beef scallion pancake is super fresh  and the sauce inside the pancake is incredible  everything here is made fresh daily  and it's definitely the #1 go to dumpling place for anyone living in the midwest or east coast 
heard about how good the soup dumplings are so we went there today around 6pm to have dinner  restaurant wasn't crowded when we went in and they sat the 4 of us again the front window of the restaurant  waiter was most unpleasant when taking our orders  pretended not to speak english or cantonese  only mandarin  we placed order for 3 noddles and 2 orders of soup dumplings   place started filling up  which meant all these people waiting for table is now standing between us and all the wait staff who stay in the back of the restaurant   no one comes to refill our tea or see how we are doing for 20 30 minutes until the noodles dishes came out   no soup dumplings  ask the waiter  he's mute   but we can hear him calling out #s in english in a really loud voice   another waitress came by and we asked about our soup dumplings and order another noodle dish   no response on the soup dumplings   after another 15 minutes and she said it's coming   when we are all done with all the noodle dishes  still no soup dumplings   my husband finally walked up to the register and corner the wait staff and she brought over a single order of soup dumpling  i asked what happened to my 2nd order  she again said it's coming  in the meantime  the table next to us who sat down 30 40 minutes after us got their soup dumpling and finished eating and ready to pay  the waitress came back saying our 2nd order is 3 minutes away   i was ready to slap her  but i was calm and said no thank you  just give me the check   we paid the $36 04 bill exactly with 1 twenty  1 ten  1 five  10 dimes and 4 pennies  i wrote on the check that service is horrible  incorrect ordering and will follow up with yelp review stating as such  the waiter avoided us and a different waitress picked up the bill with the notes and made a face  since the restaurant is busy  i don't think they care one bit whether we complained or not   we will never go back to the place even through the food is decent but we definitely had much better soup dumplings else where   definitely not worth the good reviews that people had given them   one thing we noticed is that if you are not asian  they treat you nicer  talk about reverse discrimination 
this place ranks very high on yelp  but to be honest  the taste of xiaolongbao here is just average  i would recommend "kongfu xiaolongbao" over this place  plus  this place does not take cards
mm  good  cheap food exists in nyc and it's a pretty tasty xiaolongbao to boot! i came here with a group of people and ordered three or four orders of both the seafood and pork soup dumplings which were piping hot i had the mouth burns to prove it delicate and tasty  we also got the donuts with the rice congee  it was like an unsweetened churro with a condensed milk rice bath it most richly deserved  a good way to end a meal  kind of weird to have it in the middle of it the beef scallion pancake was all right  just an okay piece of fried dough wrapped in a couple of thin slices of beef  goodness the beef noodle soup had more beef flavor and for me  was gone in seconds  there were 7 of us and it came out to 9 bucks a person  including tip  i didn't think a price like that for being so full in new york still existed!
party of two on a saturday afternoon with a good friend calls for a change of taste from the usual dim sum yum cha realm we indulged with three platters * rice cake with shredded chicken at $6 95 which was okay but entirely swimming with oil and grease   a shanghaiese favorite as i've experienced better while in shanghai's the bund * vegetable noodle soup at $4 95 broth was entirely too salty but the noodles alone were very good   personally  i love noodles and in a soup form * shanghaiese steamed soup pork dumplings (xiao3 long2 bao1) at $5 50 which were extremely good yet served in scaling high heat temperature that burnt my mouth   the dumplings were very juicy for a classic shanghaiese staple  soup + dumplings = chinese comfort food!patrons wait for a table outside of the door as there is no proper waiting area   corridor entrance is very narrow and small   service is prompt for small parties of two but a long wait for larger parties   i do not recommend parties above five as seating is not equipped in this small restaurant setting   menus along with chinese green tea are already waiting for patrons at the table upon our seating   for three platters it foots the bill very reasonable under $20 00 including tax   facilities are small for unisex as the kitchen is direct opposite where the strong stench of soy sauce floats above   staff are fluent in both english and mandarin   yes  a takeout menu and business cards are readily available which is now added to my ever increasing collection   outside by the entrance is a small garden complete with a water windmill surrounded by man made rocks 
i've got to say that i'm a pretty big fan of this place  the food is spot on when it comes to authenticity with their mainland counterpart with less than stellar service to match the food will be on the greasier side so make sure to either bring in your own tea or drink the hot green tea they give you  don't order (ice) water the dishes are small and are for 2 3 people to get a taste of it so if you've never ordered hong kong dimsum style  this is similar in that you'll end up ordering at least 4 5 dishes per person also  seating is limited in that it's always crowded and when you do get there and after you've waited for seats  you'll be seated practically next to your neighbors so don't plan on having highly sensitive conversations here unless you're a terrible spy or an idiot government official parking is what you'd expect  very limited  timed  metered  and rare  plan on parking in the structure a few blocks down and walking to the restaurant parking  very limited metered street parkingprice  $10+ per personwait  10 20 mins to be seated
friendly staff   food was delicious and piping hot so this is definitely a place to visit for the winter   we arrived for a late lunch around 1pm and they were packed   didn't take too long to have us seated   i've been here a few times but my friend hasn't   we ordered the soup dumpling ( both regular and crab meat ) the regular was as good as i had remembered but the crab meat wasn't so memorable   it seemed to lack a certain kick to it   the spicy wonton with peanut sauce and spicy sauce was delicious as usual   and the rice cake with pork was the icing to the cake   our waitress had a great attitude and smiled a lot so for a chinese restaurant that was a breath of fresh air making my friends experience better   happy to have recommended a place he enjoyed and he will be returning to try other items on the menu 
don't get discouraged by the crowd    eventually they will call your number   first couple of times at this restaurant  it is so overwhelming as you're waiting in a small space nearly hovering over the people who are enjoying their dumplings   but luckily so speedy service  the turn around is usually quite quick there are so many places where you can get xiao long bao these days but i gotta admit this place is really damn good   i went back to joe shanghai's and in comparison not nearly as good there any more   for 2 people  we ordered the crab and pork dumpling  scallion pancake with beef and the crispy noodles with shredded chicken   so content with everything   leaving only with the need for a long walk   remember to bring cash with you!
this place has been at a steady decline  i've been coming to this restaurant for years and used to come back because the food is a solid 4 stars despite service being 1 2  now what has changed? since their renovations and michelin recs have lead to lines out the door  food quality has been atrocious  xiao long baos are still decent but they have been cutting corners everywhere else  their shanghainese noodles are about half their original size  the jelly fish with turnip is now 90% turnip when it used to be 50 50  we were there today at 10am and they told us they didn't have spicy beef tripe nor turnip cakes  how is that possible? especially the spicy beef tripe which is a staple cold dish 
the food is was good several years ago but area is getting more competitive therefore its becoming normal xiao long bao   the fried dumplings are better   
this place is incredible! my girlfriend and i come here whenever we crave pork soup dumplings and udon noodles  i have also tried the scallion pancake with beef  all three dishes are fantastic  i have tried the crab and pork soup dumplings but i prefer the pork ones  the udon noodle is incredible  try and go outside of lunch and dinner hours and there won't be much wait  if any  great food! quick service! and amazing prices!
excellent soup dumplings and shen jian bao  i also love the cold appetizers  including the beef tendon and beef and tripe dish  there isn't much to say  except that this is the best xlb in the five boroughs (even beating my beloved shanghai cafe deluxe in manhattan chinatown)  now that i live 20 minutes from flushing by 7 train  you'll find me here more often  save some xlb for me!
i consider nan xiang to be one of the best places to get xiao long bao (xlbs) outside of china itself  we come here on a regular basis whenever we're in flushingthe scallion pancakes are some of the best i've had  that side  it's sometimes on the oily side  so might not be the best healthy option  but chances are if you're ordering it (or the beef variant) the health value of the meal is not your main concern hahaand of course  the namesake xlbs are must haves  there's the option to get baos with shrimp fillings  but i still think the regular ones are the best
everything is on average  food and price is ok  the appetizer is not good at all  really crowded and need to wait a long time to get the food 
decent food and crappy service had brunch here and enjoyed the following dishes  beef scallion pancake  beef noodle soup pork soup dumplings  pork and crab soup dumplingsthe dishes were decent but could have better  i think a better quality of beef would have done the trick the servers are not friendly and rush to get people in and out  but this is no surprise for a dumpling house  cash only of course  this is flushing  hellooooo 
there's a reason why this place was named the best soup dumplings restaurant in nyc  it was delicious!! ordered pork and crab dumplings  scallion pancakes and a cucumber dish with garlic  all amazing and so fulfilling!i would definitely be visiting more if it wasn't so the way in flushing  but if you're in the area  this is a must!
they are famous for their xiao long bao  aka soup dumplings  after trying them several times  both pork and the ones with crab  i must say that nan xiang dumpling house has done a good job but not a fine one  the xiao long bao's skin are delicate  the right thickness  a bit chewy  the "soup stock" inside is aplenty but nothing to write about  the fat ratio is a bit too high  leaving a very greasy after taste that not even the dip sauce (black vinegar+ginger) can cut through  while their noodle dishes are about average (too much starch and not enough of quality ingredients)  i would suggest you try breakfast items like salty soy milk  fried dough curls and scallion pancakes  their scallion pancakes and the scallion pancake with sliced beef are decent renditions  however  i don't recommend take outs on these as being in a container will soften the pancakes  it is preferable to consume them crispy  their soups have surprised me  they add more than the bare minimum to the stocks  such as shrimp skin and chopped scallions  this reminds me of my mother's cooking  my beef with nan xiang is that their food in general are too oily  i wrap up my meals there when i feel too greased up  not because i'm full 
dare i say best soup dumplings in nyc? definitely better than joe shanghai  get the crab with pork instead of just the pork for $1 more  the scallion pancake with beef is pretty tasty as well if you are looking at a second option 
awesome soup dumplings   everything else is just as good  place is small and get crowded really fast service is also good
excellent place and i would recommend this to anyone   the menu is elaborate and the staff is amazing   although is it it is not a kosher place their bottles of water or poland spring or the sunny are good and their bathrooms are always clean  since i'm always on the road giving driving lessons they let me use their bathroom without a problem and are always very polite
i've been coming here for a while now and it is still my favorite soup dumpling place in the nyc area  compared to the very popular joe shanghai  i still prefer this place  it is homey and expanded in recent years to accommodate more people  a regular order of 6 dumplings runs at $5 95 per order  i like to pair it with the shanghai udon noodles  it's definitely a place where you come and eat family style  if you haven't been here yet  you must come  you will not be disappointed  they're open til 1 30am on weekends and parking at the small municipal is free after 10pm; the parking lot is across the street 
the food was good and cheap we ordered the dumplings but it took a long time to come out  the place is really busy it was a line out the door when we went  we also tried their soup which had a really good flavor good stuff 
got this dumplings towards the end of a gluttonous tour of asian food in the area and geez were they good!i'm not ready to say if i prefer these to the other soup dumplings i had a few days ago in manhattan's chinatown but these were simply amazing  even at 3pm in the afternoon there was a 20m wait for a table  however these were well wroth the wait  you won't regret it  the "c" restaurant inspection grade sitting in the window lets you know that the food must taste really great 
when in flushing i must eat chinese food but really do i have any other options? no  i had this place bookmarked and can't remember how i found it  glad i did and seized the opportunity to take a ride to flushing last night with my dad and his best friend  decor is nothing to talking about here but the place was very  very clean  there are three rooms you can be sat in and all table service  it was very crowded but i understand why and we had to hold a ticket and wait no more than 5 10 minutes  they gave us complementary tea that was sweet and our waitress was always there to refill  we ordered three things and i think everything on the menu was under $10  such a great deal  i had the salted pork and cabbage soup with noodles ($5 95)  it was delicious i shared with the table  i couldn't finish the entire thing alone  the salt wasn't overpowering  my dad had the vegetable dumplings  he thought it tasted like "a great egg roll stuffing " i passed   i was all about the soup dumplings  the soup dumplings came in a portion of 6  they were scorching hot  moist and the dumplings stayed together  the broth was succulent and fatty delicious  my type of comfort food on a freezing night  the entire meal was under $25 
the soup dumplings were pretty good but not mindblowingly so  go for the regular   the crab meat ones have a slightly odd taste to it  would not recommend the spicy sichuanese wontons (the ones drenched in chili sauce)  they also have a good offering of cold side dishes like bean curd and seaweed  service was suspect   the person that took our order simply listened without jotting anything down on a notepad  of course  we had to remind them of one of the dishes we orderd after everything else had arrived  i don't think this is the norm at this place and that person didn't look like a server (was not wearing a uniform) but was from the kitchen apparently    still  if you're going to take orders  do it like you mean it 
i'd come back again and again forever  just for their crab soup dumplings  seriously  i delight in my trips here  everything else is good (beef pancake  fried pork buns  regular pork soup dumplings)  but not grrrrreat  overall  4 5 stars 
it's really shocking for me to give this place a bad review  i love dumplings  usually any dumpling and this place is probably the most highly rated dumpling house in nyc  i'm just not a fan nothing here  maybe except the scallion pancake with beef is worth returning for in my opinion i'm by no means a soup dumpling expert but i just didn't enjoy these compared to the ones from joe shanghai or even lesser known dumpling houses  the skins were indeed thin and expertly made but the flavors were just off  another aspect of why i didn't love the experience here was probably because i felt terrible afterwards  do not get the shanghai noodle dish  it was probably the greasiest dish i've ever had anywhere  yes  i fully understand that most of these dishes are meant to be greasy and i shouldn't be complaining but it was really just over the top and had little to no flavor  by the end of the meal i was desperately searching your more water ( that never came) and any vegetable possible the one thing i did really enjoy was the scallion pancake with beef  very unique and tasty but even that was very greasy and i probably couldn't handle eating more than 1 3 of it without feeling a bit gross i know people love this place but i just can't  mock me now if you must 
the dim sum menu lacked many of favorite dishes  all of the dumplings were either pork or veggie  no chicken  beef  or shrimp  the steamed bun selection was minimal  no red bean buns  the sticky rice came in plastic wrap instead of wrapped in a leaf the food we got was good  but the selection was not 
yes  the soup dumplings here really are fantastic and it's ridiculously cheapbut the service is gasp worthy brusqueit's totally a no frills joint  but be prepared to have your guard up bc they will yell at you! there was an error on the check and we got chastised for an item we didn't even receive! it's *almost* comical  but not really
omg  i love this place  we came on a friday night  and it was packed  surprisingly  it only took about 15 min to sit my party of 3  even though there was a ton of people waiting this was my third time having soup dumplings ever and they were by far the best ones i've had  we ordered copious amounts of the pork buns and the crab meat buns  the soup dumplings did not break and they were so good! i preferred the pork ones  but the crab ones were good too  in addition to that we ordered the beef scallion pancakes  regular scallion pancakes  pan fried dumplings  steamed dumplings  shaobing and fried udon noodles  everything was great! there was not one bad thing that we ate  overall it was pretty darn good  and so cheap! i can't wait to come back again!
place has gone down a lot for the passed couple of year  the only thing that's somewhat good is their pork soup dumplings  the shanghai noodle is way too oily and the veggie came with it is not well washed sometime  service is what you expect from a typical chinese restaurant  not there 
this was the fastest service we've received  probably in our entire lives came here after spa castle on a snowy saturday night and it was packed but there's always an empty table somewhere  we ordered the beef scallion pancake sort of thing  the soup dumplings (called buns on the menu) and the pan fried udon noodles  the scallion pancake thing was awesome and hit all the spots after a couple of drinks  the soup dumplings  however  were a little bland  the broth was boring but the meat tastes more like actual meat than i've had in other dumplings  the fried udon noodles were delicious  even after some of them went home and were reheated  great place to go if you're looking to be seated fast and eat quickly  but i think there's better food in the area 
i been this place for so many times  the taste of food is good   also the place nearby 7 train at main street  which is a plus   but the service is kind of bad  they don't really care of you as a customer   and cash only is kind of inconvenience for customers 
can't say enough how great this place is  always wanted to try it and glad i made the leap  definitely one of the best places around the food was great and a few of my friends frequent the place and none of us ever had a bad experience  the service was slow but really friendly  it gets pretty busy so its understandable  maybe i'll drop in when its a bit slow to get a feel for it 
wonderful soup dumplings (crab and pork)  beef scallion pancakes are out of this world 
as a west coast asian american  i've always wanted to spend some time exploring flushing  but have never really gotten the chance on my always too short visits to new york  i finally made the trek up the 7 on a rainy morning  for a visit to a korean radio station  i had lunch plans afterward  but refused to leave the neighborhood without making at least one attempt to eat something delicious  i got on yelp and found nan xiang dumpling house  within walking distance of both the radio station and the train  it was exactly what i was looking for i walked in at around ten o'clock on a thursday morning  and the place wasn't full  but it was definitely already busy  i got a table near the entrance  so i didn't see the rest of the restaurant  but i had the sense that it was big  i figured it had to be  as what i saw of the staff indicated a pretty large scale operation  i was eating alone  and figured this was the kind of place with little ceremony and high turnover  where i could be in and out in ten minutes if i chose  my snack took a little longer than that  service was fine  i got my order taken quickly  and my server was polite  but the dumplings took longer to come out than expected they were worth the wait  i got an order of the xiaolongbao  which came with six piping hot soup dumplings  they were delicious  with thin skins and a meaty filling of pork enveloped in savory  velvety  fragrant soup  i'm sure i looked like a fool eating them  i feel like i relearn how to eat xiaolongbao every time i order them  then forget all those lessons by the next time  i'm always over cautious on dumpling #1  then burn my tongue on #2  then spill all the soup on #3  etc  etc  until #6  when i finally eat without embarrassing myself  (my two main techniques  for the record  are 1) puncturing the skin  putting a little soy sauce vinegar sauce inside  then blowing vigorously over the hole and 2) waiting long enough that the dumpling can be eaten in a single warm bite  molten juice and all  and yet i am rarely able to execute either of these smoothly for more than one or two dumplings per order ) but ineptitude aside  these dumplings were splendid  well worth a moderate amount of shame and physical pain i want to spend more time in flushing on future trips to new york  and will keep nan xiang in mind next time i visit  an order of xiaolongbao is a light breakfast or midday snack  and i'll squeeze one in whenever i can 
cash only  must try the dumplings  delish! great place to order a bunch of appetizers and share with your group  great price for a meal for 4   about $60 
food is good  but the service def needs some work  the hostess will ignore you to stay on her cellphone   even if you say excuse me multiple times  the servers are a mixedbag  you get some that are super attentive and some that you wave down  overall their food is worth the wait  but if you're looking for a quick bite i wouldn't recommend it since you're never sure what you're gonna get with wait time 
i love the pork buns here   the only thing i dislike was the fact that they only take cash
wow! amazing experience  we arrived at 11am on a saturday and had to wait 5 minutes  not bad  once we were seated  tea was poured immediately and we placed our order  food came out really quickly and everything was insanely good  the highlights of the meal   pork buns  best pork bun i've ever had  my two little kids also loved them    soup dumplings  amazing  world's most perfect food    scallion pancake with beef  most surprising item of the lunch  crispy  tender  and it had lots of yummy hoisin sauce in it  we had many other amazing dishes  those are only the highlights  by far  the best dumplings i've had in nyc  better than all the ones i've had in san francisco too 
the dumplings here are really good and deserves the hype  the prices are reasonable and the service is fast  however  outside of the dumplings  the food leaves a lot to be desired  we had rice cakes with pork and preserved vegetables  that plate was pretty plain  we also had jellyfish with turnips and all we got was a plate of turnips with a few jellyfish as garnish  if you plan on coming to nan xiang  i would recommend just sticking to the dumplings which is definitely what they do best 
service  1 5 but that's how it is in almost every authentic chinese place ) pork xiao long bao  4 5 5 really juicy but kinda doughypan fried dumplings  3 5good but sooo doughyyy shanghai fried noodles  2 5 5 on the dry side  wish there was more meat soy milk & crispy dough  1 5 meh  meeeh 
my family has been coming to this place when they had just one dining room which is now 3 dining areas  the soup dumplings are great and they are always crowded so make sure give yourself extra time 
yummy in my tummy soup dumplings! this place is probably one of the better soup dumpling places on flushing! i prefer this place over joe's shanghai (as their food is a little more americanized! stick with the authentic kind!i usually just order the crab meat soup dumpling  noodles  soy bean milk  and cucumbers with garlic!
it was 'aight but i think there are better soup dumplings to be had in flushing  and definitely in the world  the broth is very good but you don't end up with that sticky feeling on your lips that comes from tons of gelatin the broth that incredible unctuous feeling  the skins are good and have a great chew to them; could be thinner the fuqi feipian (beef and tripe in spicy sauce) is excellent and very flavorful  the scallion pancakes with beef was disappointing    the pancakes are greasy and slightly cold  the beef is dry decent but definitely not worth the hype and better to be had in the area 
legit shanghainese soup dumplings! with over 6 years on michelin's food recommended guide and  1800+ reviews on yelp  this place has got to be good and it certainly was  very good food with the prices to match  was not disappointed  was very surprised to find out they have soy milk here as well  i myself loveee soymilk so i'm glad they have that here  yum
how can a place be so good and so cheap and so fast?the sliced beef pancakes and pork soup dumplings may be two of the best things i have ever eaten in life  ever  i want to come back and eat everything on the menu  will probably only cost $40  go here now!
the pork soup dumplings  the scallion pancakes  nothing more to say 
wonderful xiao long bao for the cold weather  cash only is the preferred method of payment in the flushing area  i enjoy the crab meat and pork xiao long bao  the pork chop is tender and delicious  the dish is perfect size for individual or small group the scallion pancake is superb and crispy unlike any others i have tried before 
their spicy beef noodle soup is good  udon noodles are ok  steamed pork dumplings were disappointing  maybe the pan fried dumplings are better  however  the place was crowded on a sunday afternoon  15 minute wait for 2 people  other people seam to like this place  but i think i prefer schezwan food 
a spot i'm really happy to have made the effort to visit  for this diner i had to take the number 7 train all the way from midtown out to the end of the line in flushing  a short walk in the rain and delightful baskets of steamed sour dumplings awaited us  we had the pork and crab pork dumplings with a side of seaweed with garlic (spicy  excellent!)  we also had the spicy wontons which are served in a peanut broth with a bit of a kick  very nice!tried to order beers but our server honestly didn't seem to understand us  it was no bother  really  as the hot tea was sufficient  the restaurant was pretty packed at 8 45  by the time we finished it was thinning out for the evening and we received nice smiles from some of the kitchen staff upon leaving there's just nothing like visiting this part of town  particularly if you've had your fill of manhattan and just want to get away  looking forward to a return visit to nan xiang and more baskets of dumplings filled with savory broth 
my friend was told nan xiang's soup buns were better than the famous joe's shanghai   we decided to venture over to flushing and give it a try  food *steamed pork buns ($5 50  6 buns) and steamed crabmeat pork buns ($6 50  6 buns)   good and worth a try if you're in the area   the buns were large and full of flavor   i do wish their soup spoons were a bit larger to match their buns because part of my soup spilled out    in comparison to joe's  nan xiang's had a better soup flavor   however  i wasn't a big fan of the thicker skin or a stronger ginger mix to their pork mixture *shanghai shao mai ($2 95  4 pieces)   good  though it wasn't what i thought it was  instead of a pork mixture wrapped inside a sui mai  sticky rice was the contents and topped off with a pea   what to know *cash only*the buns take 20 minutes to come out*service is decent  they come around to refill your tea cups but they're sometimes hard to flag down*we were seated immediately on tuesday at 1pm   i hear there's a wait on the weekends
our go to place for shanghainese food   in my opinion  joe shanghai's crab meat soup dumplings are better but everything else here is much more authentic than joe shanghai   great place for no thrills  fast service  real shanghainese food   their kau fu  salted soy milk and rice cakes are very yummy   sometimes their noodles can be a little peppery but overall worth it 
amazing menu assortment  nostalgic and delicious  better than any xiao long bao i've had before  this is my go to place every time i'm in new york  i have and always will beg my friends to spend some time with me in flushings to grab those freshly made dumplings and a couple bowls of fresh soy milk  small and a bit of a unassuming place  but the best places usually are 
my favorite soup dumpling place in flushing  not a fan of joe's shanghai only because its always a crowd of tourists there now  my favorite order is   crab and pork steamed buns  chili pepper beef noodle soup  iced soy milk  beef scallion noodles their prices arent too bad and its a good choice for a weekend brunch or just a regular lunch  parking gets packed in the municipal across the street but  what do you expect? its flushing 
every time we come here we are incredibly satisfied  the food is delicious  it comes out quickly  it's inexpensive  it's awesome  the pan fried udon noodles  the steamed pork dumplings (which are soup dumplings) are to die for  their scallion pancakes are the best you can get  we have tried many  many places between flushing  china town and throughout the boroughs  seriously  come here  it's so good 
i used yelp help to locate this restaurant will staying in flushing before our flight out yummy the best dumplings  everything we ordered was delicious  our experience was superb and the service was friendly  cash only was odd 
hands down the best dumplings i've ever had  i also had the shanghai pan fried udon  which was also delicious  i definitely will be coming back here  cash only though  make sure you go to the atm 
yes  yes and yes! you checked this place? you wanna eat chinese food? really good chinese food?come now! now!the line is long but if you decide to come earlier then you'll get a seat  around 11am  the week is easier to eat here  the weekend is not!everything here is amazing  as many other yelpers state  so the disappointment rate is pretty low with many people i've introduced to this place  the dumplings  soup dumplings  soy milk  fried dough  seafood crispy noodles  and noodles and more dumplings    ahhh!!!! just get it  you won't spend much because it is not so expensive and the portions are very good for more than 2 people  enjoy and live long!
amazing food    huge portions   great price  be prepared to line up  which is always a good sign of a quality meal
food  4 out of 5of all the soup dumplings that i've tried in flushing  this is probably my favorite  their pan fried pork buns are very good too  what's not so good? the pan fried shanghai noodles are too greasy and the fried dumplings are mediocre at best  service  3 out of 5the service is pretty much standard chinese restaurant service  once in a while  you might find a nice waitress waiter  but that is a rarity in flushing  hostess  1 out of 5she's always doing her nails or staring at her phone  a few times i ordered take out and waited right in front of her for my food  my food came out and she could not be bothered to tell me that it was my food and let it sit there until i asked for it  but beware  ask her too many times  she'll get annoyed and roll her eyes at you 
i don't know what the hype is all about  i got dinner here and ordered a few soup dumplings  i got the crab and the regular pork ones  both were very fragile  the dumpling pouch kept busting and all my soup was lost with probably 2 successfully being slurped  the broth was very tasty but the the dough was a disappointment  probably won't be coming back seeing there are so many other dumpling houses to try 
flushing appreciation day  stop 6   the venue  nan xiang dumpling housethe dl  i come here for one and one reason only   their soup dumplings  aka xiao long bao  while some may consider paper as china's greatest invention  i personally believe it to be the soup dumping  after all  how can one craft elegant reviews on an empty stomach? answer  you can't  also  this place gets hella packed  so be ready for some waiting  the must try  crab soup dumping  otherwise  pork soup dumpling if you're not a fan of seafood  pro tip  place your dumping onto your soup spoon  take a bite from the top  sip the soup inside slowly  and then enjoy the meat once it's cooled down enough  the verdict  5 5  hands down my favorite go to spot for soup dumplings in the big apple 
best pork soup dumplings anywhere in la or ny  they burst with goodness in your mouth  and the creaminess of the fatty pork is so delicious!the udon noodles are also spectacular  as well as the vegetable dumplings and scallion pancakes 
one of the few places i would highly recommend for soup dumplings in nyc  i especially love the soup dumplings with crabmeat  also good are the scallion pancakes and cold shanghai nese cold side dishes  i usually also order a bowl the salty soybean drink if i get there early enough  lines are to be expected when you get there    pricing of the food is fairly good for food in flushing and well worth the wait! sometimes  my friends and i would startout here with a order of crabmeat souple dumplings each as pur appetizer  and moving on to another restaurant for the main meal 
food tastes terrific but they can get very crowded with wait time  do not arrive starved 
came here for xiao long bao and wasn't disappointed  as good as i've ever had for a good price  got a table straight away  restaurant was half full around 6 45pm on a friday  quick and friendly service and no rushing us out the door to free up the table even though place was full and people waiting when we left 
traditional spicy hot pot!!!nice tasty! we have been here for many times! it is a good place to choose for dinner!
tasty food at reasonable price  80% authentic flavor as compared to china  would go again 
i was very disappointed with tonight's dinner  my issues with them are two things  wrong order and very bad customer services the story is as follows we went into the store and were quickly moved to an empty table  i was very happy about that  when we were ordering steam bun  we asked for the regular ones and not the crab one due to the fact that one of our members has food allergy with carb  **note  we confirmed twice with them for the regular one and not  the crab meat one by the time we finished eating  we asked for the check and it applies we ate the crab one  therefore we ask the lady to come over and ask her to charge us for regular one the lady initially agree to change it but then her colleague decided to step in and said "it was just one dollar and of course you can't taste the crab meat because it was just one dollar extra "when i heard that sentence  i felt really upset because one dollar is very light weighted but a human life is very heavy  i didn't want to argue with her because she has no idea of how food is vital to human life to those who liked this restaurant or thinking about going to this one  i will strongly ask you to not go because they don't show any respect to customers nor their decisions on choosing the food  very dishonest food restaurant 
*must try  scallion pancakes with beef *crispy seafood noodles are greasy  but amazing *excellent soup dumplings  but be cautious of the hot soup inside!*expect a very long wait 
my husband and i trekked out to flushing to try out nan xiang dumpling house   there was a crazy line outside  which was good to see  as it seems as if it's a hit among the locals   you go inside the restaurant and you tell the owner how many are in your party   he writes the number down and gives you a numbered ticket   the line actually moves along pretty decently  which was good!  there are actually 3 sections  and we got to sit in the main area  by the windows   the restaurant offers breakfast items  dim sum  soups  cold and hot appetizers  entrees  and beverages   we came here for the xlbs  so we ordered the steamed pork buns; i also tried out the pork & vegetable wontons in spicy sauce and a cup of (cold) sweet soybean milk (in which you can also request hot)   the xlbs were just okay   i thought the broth itself wasn't as flavorful and in depth as the other places we've tried; even the meat seemed a little tad underseasoned; the outer skin is a little thicker  but i didn't mind that   i think there are better xlbs  so it was a little disappointing!  however  i was a huge fan of their wontons!  the wontons themselves were handmade  tasted fresh  and was coated in this 'spicy' sauce that wasn't that spicy to begin with; it was creamy and had a peanut y taste to it   i also dipped that in soy sauce just for an extra oomph; i could have eaten 10 bowls of these  d  these alone make it worth the trek   the cold soybean milk was refreshing  and it literally tasted like a sweetened tofu drink   so  if you love the taste of tofu with some added sugar  you can check this out +forget about their xlbs+pork & vegetable wontons in spicy sauce worth the trek!+cold sweet soybean milk (refreshing)
this place was overall really good  service was diligent and instantly gave out menus  took orders and brought out food in no time  i came here for one thing and one thing only  their famous soup dumplings and it definitely did not disappoint  if you're in the flushing area  come check this place out !
there has never been a restaurant as obviously overrated  the food was bland at best and the service was deplorable  i've never been so disrespected as a customer  it was as if the staff detested their jobs and customers  they ignored their table and getting anything from them was like  pulling a tooth  if i could i would've given them less then 0 stars 
i came here with 2 of my co workers during lunch time and it was packed  no where to stand and an order of steamed dumplings to go would have been 20 30 minutes wait   we decided to pass and go to another place since we had to go back to work  later during dinner time    my cousin and i only came here for the xiao long bao and basically just ordered 1 plate  and i must say  it is a great snack meal to come and have  the xiao long bao was on a larger side but worth the taste  my cousin also said the noodle dishes here are good too  so i now have a reason to come back not only for the xiao long bao but to try one of their noodle dishes 
i've finally found a place that serves straight out of shanghai  comfort breakfast food! it's crazy how simple the menu is but you can't find this stuff in manhattan chinatown anywhere  thumbs up to this place serving all the traditional foods that my grandma and mom were raised on in the motherland  you have to start off with a bowl of sweet soy bean milk (hot) dou jiang or if you prefer the saltier version   salty soy bean milk  pair that with fried dough (you tiao) and you have your breakfast base  now add some side dishes   try the scallion egg bun pankcake   it's pretty good  i've definitely had better but it's good  i also tried the garlic seaweed   the one here was wayy to sour   don't get this  it definitely should not taste that way  and of course you can't forget the famous soup dumplings  the filling was made fresh and very good  the dumplings were plump full of juices  the only problem was the skin  it wasn't strong enough to keep the filling from falling out  i have to give it to joe's shanghai  they still reign supreme in this aspect  this place is an excellent option for traditional shanghai breakfast street foods 
i really like their food especially soup dumpling  it remind me my hometown  i went there several times with friends  sometimes i take out  usually you need to wait for a while for the seat or their soup dumpling  however  i think waiting is a worth thing for the good food!
not necessarily "as good as it gets"  but those pan fried buns are definitely worth the wait  i thought they forgot about them because it was a good 40+ minutes before they came out (after we devoured the rest of our food) but when it came out  baby  they were perfect  big  fluffy  juicy  umami  and perfectly crisp on the bottom  the xlbs were not as good as joe's shanghai but were pretty good nevertheless  i could have done without the cold sliced beef and tendon (too much of the sichuan peppercorns  i'm chinese but i hate those things! practically a sichaun peppercorn paste!) i disliked their version of siu mai  which was glutinous rice mixed with fatty beef with a pea on top  definitely not what i was expecting 
still the best soup dumplings on this side of the pacific  for newbies  this is not a restaurant for a long family dinner  it's a sit down  order the best shanghainese food  eat it and leave kind of place  service is incredibly fast (once you get in which can be hard during peek times)  we've tried almost everything on the menu  and haven't found a dish we can say is bad 
wowow silly dragon lady over here gave us some serious attitude  she really over stepped so crucial boundaries by tossing our respective chopsticks and straw at us  the food seems to be on the decline and the service becomes ever more diminishing  in an era where yelp reviewers cast judgement upon every detail this lady really over stepped her boundaries  tourist trap 
after many many visits here  i also have to recommend their spicy beef with tripe   it's served cold and it almost has a pickled taste  it's delicious  our usual order as many xiao long baos as we can eatspicy beef with tripeshanghai noodlesamaze balls!i also love that they've expanded so less of a wait than before!
first time here  the dumplings we had were ok (we had steamed vegetable dumplings  pan fried dumplings and the shanghai shao mo)  they all were good  we also had the scallion pancakes (with and without meat)  the place was clean and the hostess wasn't very welcoming  i definitely will come back and try the other dumplings  service was straight forward 
the dumplings are good but deinitely have fallen from the top notch scale  they continue to get away with enforcing cash only which any taxpaying citizen should be furious about they really were the best soup dumplings in nyc at one point so it's obviously recommended to go try it but the best ones is a small store front in shanghai  yeah i'm dead serious about traveling to try food 
had great shanghai breakfast here  service was a little brusque  but to be expected for a 老外 like me  the 油条 were great  as were the 小笼包 that the place is named and famed for  the restaurant was clean  service was fast and the food was delicious  overall experience 非常好!!! well worth the schlep out to flushing  would recommend!
this place is rated better than it should be  it's passable but that's it   the dumplings are not bad but nothing hits my tongue like joe's shanghai  the spicy tendon wasn't bad but not spicy either   the beef and scallion pancakes are a disaster   greasy  oily  and some weird sweetness made it inedible   too bad i wanted this as another spot hit while in flushing the food truck across the street happens to be awesome   i would skip this and hit the food truck anyday
uninspiring food  terrible service  incompetent staff  you can get this quality of food from the dollar hole in the wall vendors all around main st  flushing  stop tricking yourselves into going here  it is poor quality  d+
this is one of the top restaurants in all of nyc  the kitchen is incredibly focused and consistent they deserve two michelin stars  not an honorable michelin mention i like that the menu is very focused on classic shanghai food and doesn't need to stray into items meant to please the american palate the spicy beef and tripe cold dish is a great way to start off make sure to order at least one basket of crab and pork xiao long bao the second you sit down the scallion pancake w  beef is the best example i've had treat yourself to a side of fried pork chops the shanghai siu mai contain sticky rice and are one of my favorites among a menu of winners don't expect overly warm or coddling service  but the wait staff is efficient and friendly enough 
the best soup dumpling place in flushing  everything on the menu is super cheap and worth getting  i personally dont like crabmeat because it has that particular smell to it  i love their panfried noodle and scallion pancake!
amazing xlbs  also get the beef scallion pancakes  the pan fried pork buns are good  but not incredible  the shanghai noodles are wonderfully chewy  albeit oily and could use more beef veggies  gets very busy on weekend evenings so come early! my go to shanghainese restaurant 
really tasty spot  very affordable  huge portions  cash only  nothing much else to say other than that i left satisfied 
if people ever tells me that joe shanghai got the best soup dumplings i will definitely ask them if they had ever tried nan xiang before?  personally i think joe is overrated and a tourist trap but that's just my personal opinion nan xiang started with one store front and eventually expanded to three  just that shows how popular and how good the dumplings are here  if you come to nan xiang  there is are really only one or two items that's a must get and you guessed  pork soup dumplings and crab soup dumplingsyes the pork soup dumplings and crab soup dumplings are so freaking awesome!! they are made to order so before you even sit  tell them you want to start with the soup dumplings and then proceed to read the menu soup dumplings here have a very thin layer of dumpling skin so when you bite into it (make sure you don't burn your tongue) you'll get this soft chewy yet not so greasy bite of meat and skin   try to eat it as quickly as possible cause when these thing turn cold  they are really not very good the cold dishes here are not too shabby neither  i especially enjoy the braised bean curd and the spicy beef tendon  and for appetizer i would recommend getting the scallion pancake or the scallion pancake with beef   both offer excellent flavor and texture  the shanghai stir fried udon was not that good here  there was literally no meat in it and it's extremely greasy (how much oil do they put in it?)  food were really cheap here  after picking soup dumpling  stir fried udon and braise bean curd  totally came out to be around $25  super worth it!nan xiang is a great place to eat at and offer excellent value for the quality of food they serve   just make sure you order the soup dumplings!
joe's shanghai is the chain that is popular  however  nan xiang xiao long bao in flushing is the best place for soup dumplings i have tried  when i crave soup dumplings  i think about this restaurant  you will burn your tongue if you bite straight into a dumpling  my technique is to bite a small hole in the dumpling and slowly drink the soup before eating the rest of it  the fried bun is also great if you want to avoid the hot soup  moreover  the scallion pancake and noodle dishes are excellent  although it is a trek from manhattan  it is walking distance from the last stop on the 7 train if you are visiting new york and looking for recommendations for asian food  feel free to message me through yelp and i can share my personal lists of great spots in the city  which includes my yelp reviews  the information for an electronic copy can also be found via my yelp profile 
food is ok  average level as a chinese restaurant  but their service is just like shit  waiters keep ignoring you in not typical busy time  not accept credit card   anyway  never again 
luckily  i stopped by on a weekday so no long wait  while everyone is raving about the soup dumplings  the spicy beef tripe was the real winner for me  the soup dumplings were on point though! but oh my goodness  the spicy beef tripe so yum with the perfect amount of spiciness  loved the tofu fa (sweet bean curd drink) as well  which was lightly sweet  super smooth and warmed my belly surprisingly  i wasn't too fond of the scallion pancake with beef  the sauce with the beef killed it for me  (
very bad and rude service  they run their business like wall street  don't go  everything is overrated 
ohh maaa lawdd!!!if you are in flushing neighborhood and wonder what to eat this is the place to go!!i mostly come here after i study at presso cafe and then get a good meal for a cheap price and right after i would go for shaved ice at snowdays! but back to the dumplings! but why talk about things when you have the pros and cons list!!pros great food! (dumpling  enough said)cheap price (bring like $15~$20 and your set)pretty good location for dumpling house seats about 60 ishfast food preparationcons cash only!!no wifibut honestly trust me  you are not going to regret spending $15 on this place just go have some dumplings  what are you still doing readings this dumb review? gooo!
don't get takeout  it takes at least half hour  i'm still waiting for my food and the service people really don't care 
i've been craving for dimsum and this place was just the right place! visited around 11 am  didnt have to wait for the table but still the place was pretty packed! had crab pork dimsum  vegetable  and spicy peanut sauce wonton!!! amazing!!! will def be back!!!!
this place was ight  had high hopes going in but was hugely disappointed in my xiao long baos tearing apart on the bottom when i picked them upcan a brotha get a leaf of cabbage underneath his baos?!?
crab and pork xiao long bao  compared to the regular pork one  you can taste the difference  the crab meat isn't really visible because it has been blended with the pork  but the flavor is definitely there  i suggest getting a platter of each and try them both  their scallion pancake is good too  but make sure you get it with beef  it is different from the regular thin ones  you can tell this one is deep fried because it's thick and a slightly crunchy  golden brown layer on the outside  but chewy on the inside  it comes with tiny scallion pieces and hoisin sauce i haven't had the radish cakes before but other people seem to like them  but these are the 3 main things you should get while dining here  the dining area seems small at first when you walk in  but they have a lot more seating to the right and the back 
the quality of the xiao long bao (little soup dumpling) has definitely dropped from what it use to be in my opinionit is still better than most other places but within the last year the skin has gotten thicker and isn't the same as it use to be   still worth getting compared to the other shanghainese placesi highly recommend the spicy beef  or the scallion pancake with beef  little soup dumpling and or the soy milk
great chinese food  all reasonably priced  the service is quick and you don't have to wait long for the food to come out  i'm docking points for the fact that they don't accept card  one of the waitresses was too busy with her phone to seat us and that my spoon was dirty and was stuck to the napkin 
delicious food  good prices whats not to love  we felt like we went to china gained 10lbs and came back  )
one of my go to places for expertly handmade  xiao long bao (aka "soup dumplings")  a signature food of the nanxiang area (aka shanghai)  thus the eponymous name which definitely does not disappoint i have to admit i only go there for the xlbs so i can only attest to those delicious morsels  again perfectly handcrafted   the dough just the right satisfying amount of chew  thin yet sturdy enough to hold the juicy meat filling and that wonderful broth  seasoned with creamy slightly lardy pork or the addition of sweet salty crab fat  unctuous and silky   add a slight touch of the supplied ginger black vinegar and the entire bite is a perfect symphony of classic flavors that transported me back to shanghai the price is right  the wait if there is is justifiable and definitely worth the schlep to this great corner of queens  i don't wanna hear any complaints about the trek   i drive from connecticut!
when it's a cold winter's day   when everybody's too broke for the normal fancy food   when you and all your friends are all super hungry and can't make proper decisions   nan xiang is the place to go  i've been coming here for years now for many  many times  and the best thing about this place is of course the soup dumplings  my favorites are the crab and pork soup dumplings and the beef scallion pancake  the service here is adequate  the decor is simple (perhaps falling into a category of asian zenful bare)  what shines is the food  price point  and hours! (i've been here at midnight before   opened until 1 am on weekends )come here and scald your face off from greedy eating  btw  accepts cash only  so make sure your wallet is full 
came here last night  very busy on a sunday night so you know its good  had the cucumber and garlic and seafood rice cake both which were very good  also had the beef rolled with scallion pancake which was awesome! wanted to try the veggie dumplings and soy sauce tofu but they were out  next time!
i go here probably once every other month  and it has quickly become one of my favorite spots in flushing  some must order items are the pork and crab soup dumplings (educate yourself on how to eat these before attempting   you will burn yourself if you just pop the whole thing in your mouth)  scallion pancake with beef  and rice cake with pork and preserved mustard  the restaurant is clean  very affordable  and conveniently located near the 7 train on main street  i'm knocking off one star for the service  i never expect warm and friendly service at any restaurant in flushing   the service here isn't unfriendly  but i can't remember one time i have visited when i didn't have to flag down a server for tea refills or the check  basically  this is five stars for the food  two or three stars for service 
udon noodles with pork were really good and filling  on top of that we ordered soup  dumplings and scallion pancakes all were so good  food here was delicious  fairly priced and the service was very good as well 
i went here based on all the reviews and i was not impressed  the soup inside the dumplings wasnt hot and i didnt think the flavor was anything special  the scallion beef pancake was too sweet and nothing special  the woman at the cash register looked like she was waiting for a bus  everyone says this place is so cheap but i can get much higher quality food for $12
i wonder who are these ppl that gave this place all these amazing superb five star reviews  seriously after living in flushing for over 9 years  we finally decided to give this place a try  it's all street style food serve in a sit down restaurant  no dish in the menu worth mentioning  hence why i never wanted to come here  but we decided to try it out  (shoulda went next door 66 or smth) anyway  here's what we ordered  1)scallion pancake  this has to be the worst i ever had  deep fried and drenched in bad oil  it should always be pan fried !!!! 2)stir fried rice cake with slice pork and chopped up green veg? tasted okay  but the veggie were not cleaned washed completely  after the very first bite  there was that dirt sand stuff mix in it all together  absolutely unacceptable  3)crab meat soup dumpling  they were ok  nothing spectacular  you could get the same just about anywhere else in flushing  4)pork chop noodle soup  the broth tasted like hot boiled water with added msg and chicken broth powder  noodle were definitely not hand made  it was all stuck together to the bottom of the hot water broth  pork chop is again super deep fried drenched in oil save yourself the money  go to any spot next door on the same block !!we will never come here again    
best chinese food i have ever had  i am vegetarian so we ordered vegetarian dumplings and scallion pancakes to share and the veggie udon stir fry (i asked to make it vegetarian so it has no shrimp powder)  and my friend ordered the crispy noodle chicken  he said it was also the best chinese food he has had outside of his chinese friend's home  everything was delicious and they pour you tea upon being seated which is great  quick service and seriously amazing flavored  could eat here every day and night no joke!
we walked in and thought the language barrier would be difficult but it wasn't  really digged the pork and crab soup dumplings even though i clumsily spilled some of the soup on myself because it was extremely soupy and tasty (oops)  we also had the scallion pancakes which i didn't particularly enjoy because it was bland and just crispy  we should've gotten the scallion pancake with beef   ( oh well  and also  we got the hot soy milk (salty) and it wasn't what we expected  it was alright but was quite odd! we also got the fried udon noodles which were quite oily and enjoyable and filling  i'd honestly only go back for the dumplings  the total came out to about $20 13 in total and it was super satisfying! next time i know what to get  will be back!
this place is definitely worth a try if you are in the area  the interior is pretty plain and boring but the food is interesting  we ordered 4 items  although it was presented as dim sum  all of the dishes were pretty large and 4 for 2 people was way more than enough  we had the pan fried pork buns  they were like steamed bao's with the bottoms fried crispy  the meat inside was not bbq pork but more like ground pork that you'd find in a dumpling      which was our next dish  pan fried dumplings  they were good  had better  had worse  3rd dish was a spicy wonton in peanut sauce  again good not great  the peanut sauce was very thin and had only a very light flavor of peanut but good spice level and pretty tasty  the star of the show  by far  was the scallion pancake stuffed with sliced beef  they were crispy on the outside  chewy on the inside with a thin sliced beef filling in a sweet and spicy sauce  these were worth the visit on their own!prices were very reasonable 
chances are that if you ask me to go eat cheap  delicious chinese food    i'm 99% in  that's exactly what this place is  you can get 3 4 dishes for just about $20  what a steal!this is one of my favorite soup dumpling restaurants  seriously so delicious and so satisfying  get either the pork or the crab meat soup dumplings   you can't go wrong here  scallion pancakes are also a must! if you're craving a noodle dish  go for the shanghai fried udon noodles  yum  yum  yum! my mouth is watering just thinking about all these dishes cash only and the place is small  so go at an off hour so you won't have to wait!
their food used to be really good  now it's just okay  still the best soup dumplings in flushing  but the other stuff isn't as great  (rice cake  appetizers  noodles rice)service is also mediocre now  really disappointed with them their food has gotten really greasy and there's a lot of msg real reason why it's still three stars is because there aren't other options around unless you go all the way to kung fu xlb 
this is my first time trying nan xiang xiaolongbao  it was really good but nothing too "wow" about it  by 1pm they have already sold out of the pan fried pork buns and the beef&stripe dish   which was kinda disappointing since we don't live in new york and would like to try everything of the menu  scallion pancake with beef was a tasty dish to have as an appetizer  although it is a bit oily but it's the oiliness that made this dish so amazing  think about it  fried dough with beef   what's not to like about it ? service was really nice   our waitress was very accommodating  will be back next time in new york  
i hate the shitty service here  i took my parents here they wanted some traditional chinese food  their food is not bad  but not impressive or excellent  start with ordering  the waitress was extremely impatient and rude  then i asked for 3 bowls to share the noodle  i asked a waiter  he rolled his eyes and walked away  no  he never brought the bowls to us  not saying all the staff here are bad  at least one guy helped us out and very polite  finally comes to the check  my dad was not sure how much to tip  the person at the receptionist told my dad whatevs  then i asked for the receipt  she was like you want the receipt? then wait  jeez no matter how good their food is (it's mediocre) i wouldn't come back here ever again for this kinda shitty service  i live in manhattan so i can find somewhere better  just hoped my parents can feel some warmness from the people from the same country and eat some chinese food that's it  ridiculous place 南翔的服务是翔 ( 
i came here specifically for their soup dumpling and was not disappointed at all  it took about 15 minutes from the time i placed the order to the time the dumpling came out  the filling for the dumpling was very flavorful! beside the dumpling  i also order the recommended scallion pancakes  i got the one with the sliced beef  the texture to the scallion pancakes were light and crispy    and a somewhat oily  but it's still really good!
good food but bad service  i've been here several times and the service is always horrible  last time we got there right after lunch rush and the place was half empty    it still took forever to place our orders and get our food  the soup dumplings are still worth it i guess  i rather come here than joe shanghai  try the spicy bamboo shoots    it's served cold with chili oil over it 
came here to grab a quick bite mid week around 5 30pm  was seated immediately and we proceeded to order both types of soup dumplings and the shanghai noodles  the food was good but not out of this world  i tried really hard but couldn't differentiate between all the other places for soup dumplings  the food was cheap so worth it  our check out experience was slow and we finally got fed up and just went to the cashier directly  the girl who was handed our check decided to start texting instead of bringing it to us   we were the table right next to the cashier 
i can't find no place like this that offers affordable  authentic  and amazing food  i tried other soup dumplings  but for some reason this place has me coming back for more  it's favorable and comforting at the same time  i absolutely love the scallion pancakes  it's my favorite over there  and combine with the hot pepper paste or hot oil  it sure makes a winning combination for me  the line can get long because the place is popular here  especially the weekend  beside the pork dumplings  there's also the rice cakes  these are definitely to try!!! i highly recommend this place if your craving for soup dumplings  should also try the soy milk here if you can  they are awesome both hot or cold!
absolutely awesome!  love the soup dumplings   better than joe's as it's not as oily   fresh  hot  juicy   our waitress was surprisingly friendly and helpful for a chinese restaurant   price can't be beat and nice atmosphere too 
after having dumpling soup from here  i feel like i am spoiled! i can't have any other dumplings from any other places! this place is great!!! especially those dumplings  the skin is thin  the meat is juicy! and i love it!!! if i live closer  i would definitely come every other day   delicious!!!
i came here on a rather drunk debauchery filled night   but apparently i was still sober enough to order what i craved   win the thing to get from this place is the soup dumplings (steamed dumplings with juicy goodness sealed inside the bun)   yes  the "soup" that comes out when the dumplings pops in your mouth will be scorching so i'd make sure you eat it with a spoon so as to not waste the "soup" personally  i'm not a big fan of soup dumplings because i'd much rather have soup with dumplings or dumplings soup   but in the days of cronuts  and doncrois  hybrids are the way to go the thing i ordered for myself was the beef stew   standard staple at any chinese joint really and you also really can't mess it up   well  you can but that is like burning toast  totally avoidable service was good  i'd even go so far as to say better than most asian places where service isn't why you go to eat there  prices & good food is so many places to eat in flush town and this place didn't really stood out to me   but i will give them a second try in hopes that it really gives me that wow factor 
came here on a late night  around 11 and glad i did because there was no wait and i've heard this place is always jammed packed  now i know why  they're homemade buns (soup dumplings) and like no other   i ordered the pork and shrimp dumpling  the only reason i didn't give this place 5 stars is because the serviced sucked  the forgot to give me a spoon and i had to flag someone down and the pretty much still forgot  but we already know  not me comes to these places for service  but i would at least expect the basic utensils 
like people say  you only need to do one thing better than everyone else to succeed in the world   and that is how nan xiang xiao long bao expanded from one store front space only to now occupying 3 store fronts in the very competitive flushing restaurants business  been  going to this place in the very beginning   back then  the seatings were very uncomfortable as they cramped tables together  you barely had enough elbows rooms  except for the soup dumplings  which is the best  the other dishes are very average  the menu was very limited in comparison to other establishments in the area  nowadays  the menu is very limted  the soup dumplings tasted just as good  the seating arrangements greatly improved but i kind of miss the cramped tables like the old days  otherwise  you could expect at least 15 mins wait time on the weekends 
have gone here several times for breakfast   pros    their food is consistently good and tasty cons    they want to seat us right next to someone else even when the restaurant is not full and we can have our own table   their employees are not the friendliest and customer service is so so at best   during one outing  i saw the waitress' thumb touch my salty bean curd soup as she was setting down my bowl   eww 
first time trying soup dumplings and man they were delicious  we got the crab and pork and pork ones  we also ordered the hot soy milk to dip with the fried dough  it was an acquired taste  i am just use to eating those fried doughs plain   we also ordered seafood rice cake dish to try and spicy beef and tripe and beef scallion pancake which was also good    the only thing i was not a fan of was the shanghai style pork shui mai it was mostly rice inside 
3 of us came here for lunch on a saturday around noon  we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table so not too bad  we ordered both the pork and crab soup dumplings  both were very good  and i don't recall liking one more than the other so you can't go wrong with either!we also ordered the beef scallion pancake which was as delicious as everyone says  though also as oily as everyone says  one thing i did like was that they have a bottle of vinegar at the table so you can use as much as you like  in my case  i like to dunk my soup dumplings and my pancake in vinegar so it worked out quite well for me!also tried the egg and chive pancake which was more like an empanada stuffed with leeks  but still good  finally we all shared the braised beef noodles which came in a spicy sauce  the noodles were very long and we suspect they were hand pulled  very delicious (though it is in fact spicy so be warned) and the beef pieces were just the right amount of tenderness  would definitely recommend this place  there seemed to be a lull in people around 12 30 1pm  it's like all the tables opened up at that point!
the best steamed  fried  and soup dumplings ever  worth the wait  right in the middle of flushing chinatown  dumplings are the best  they may not be very fast with your order  but the chef is a genius man! scallion pancakes pork dumplings a must  i will try the pig ear next time!
i've heard so many good things about this place  i've been dyinggg to try it out  i finally did  ') i came here on a friday night around 9 30pm with my boyfriend  it was busy but not so bad  we didn't have to wait to be seated or anything  we went cray cus we'd been dying to try the food here so we ordered dumplings  soup pork buns  scallion pancake with beef & udon noodles  i absolutely loved the scallion pancake  it was to die for  perfect sharing portion too  the dumplings were so fresh and delicious  the udon noodles were ahhhmazingg  everything was sharing portions  one thing that got me a bit eh was that the pork buns were so tiny! why so tiny!? if they were slightly bigger it'd be better  but that's okay cus they tasted delicious  my boyfriend ordered a regular coke to drink & i got soy bean milk! it was cold and so good    i def  recommend this place to everyone & anyone who enjoys dumplings and soup and all that kind of good stuff  the pricing was great  me and boyfriend shared all this food & still had some left over to take home  the staff was so nice & kind too  i am 110% coming back here very soon 
every time we visit nyc we make a point to come here for xlb   they have the best xlb in the area   unfortunately  the lines can be long so come early for lunch or early for dinner   fortunately this time around we just stopped for a snack at around 3 pm so we were seated immediately  ordered fried dumplings  xlb  and the spicy tendons   all was really good as expected  we haven't had a bad food experience here yet   service is your typical chinese service so don't expect too much there 
they will tell you there is a 10 15 min wait  don't believe that  the place is packed all the time  being on the michelin guide helps  at times it seams chaotic and unorganized  it's quite the opposite  a gracious dance of beautiful  delicious dishes  and as always  thanks for reading  oh yeah  cash only
excellent as usual!!!!2 seaters are cramped but u come here for the food fast turn aroundefficient staff and most are friendly!!!definitely a must stop for nyc trip!  7 line takes you to the end and it's a short 5 mins walk to address!!!
the waiter was unconcerned  not the best food neither  dont waste your time
absolutely love this place!!i have been coming here for years  you know they are good because they keep expanding  the restaurant takes up a good portion of the block and is still usually packed the soup dumplings here are amazing  the soup is good and the meat is good  the crab dumplings are my favorite but the pork one is good too  you don't have to wait too long for it to arrive and it is so flavorful   they also usually do not break while you are picking it up  the beef wrap is alway good  crispy and full of goodness   there is a good amount of beef unlike other places the cold dishes! so so good  the kafu is one of my favorites  it is beyond good  there is a good mix of everything  the cucumbers are also very good also the noodles are good  especially the beef noodle   go try it now  can't go wrong with any of the dishes on the menu!
i couldn't stop thinking about the cashier episode(read the review) and didn't feel good about giving this place 4 stars even though the food was really good  hence the 2 stars sometime i wonder  how did we ever exist in the pre yelp days i cant even imagine so while driving back home from lido beach we saw the exit for flushing and we could almost sense the whiff of dumplings checked with aunt yelp and she steered us towards nan xian dumpling house there was a parking lot at $3 an hour right at the corner from the restaurant service was extremely spotty and although the restaurant was busy there were at least 3 4 servers just waiting around talking to each other after one of them was taking a break from his break  he came over with the menus we had already browsed through over the 100 reviews and the pictures and knew exactly what we wanted even before we saw the simple small unchinese like menus hubby got the pork soup dumplings and i got the vegetable dumplings and rice cake seafood noodles the dumplings were totally outta of this world and we couldn't help ordering a second round each i have never in my life seen vegetable dumplings with such generous amount of green filling the rice cake noodle was good but somehow did not fit our taste buds i prefer the soft rice balls to the chewy rice cakes while we were still working on our dumplings we saw the lady at the cashier ill treat a customer over few pennies literally she apparently short paid at the cashier but had left a decent $5 tip at the table for the server for a single order of noodle soup which was probably less than $10 we were appalled at how rude the lady was to the customer for a measly few pennies which i am sure was not the customers intention saddens me every time to see places like these who treat their customers like a piece of s*** and yet we shamelessly patronize these places all in the name of love for food 
i have been coming here for years  the food was fantastic  ever since they've expanded  it's gone downhill especially with the service  the past three times that i've been here is the reason why i'm giving it 1 star  i have given this place three chances with the last one being a total disappointment  after putting our name down for a party of 3 on a busy saturday afternoon  the hostess tells us to wait outside so that we're not blocking the entrance  we waited outside by the door for about 45 min and started to realize that ppl who came after us were getting seated  so my mom went in and asked the hostess  she tells my mom that she already called our number from inside and that we should've paid attention  umm excuse me? we waited outside like we were told and now it's our fault for not being able to hear our number from inside  the hostess carried on with her attitude and eventually got us seated with no apologies  once seated  the waiters would take orders from tables all around us first  it took about 15 min for them to finally take our orders  we had to ask for tea multiple times because they would just walk right past you even though you've made eye contact  the typical black vinegar with ginger sauce wasn't even on our table from the beginning and asking them would've taken another 15 min  we waited about an hour for our food  we watched people who came after us  finish their food while we were still waiting  at this point  i was about to get up and just leave  it seemed like they catered to all the non asians first before coming to us  well guess what? they're not the only ones writing yelp reviews! as for the food  the soup buns were good but there are other places comparable  this was by far the worst experience i've ever had  i would never come back to this establishment again 
mediocre  i was expecting something more but i'll give this place 3 5    walked in from blistering cold   guy tries to give us seat right by the door constantly swinging open haha no  like do you not see me shivering  teeth chattering and all     lol  takes a min for waiter to realize we're waiting to place our order   ordered the soup dumplings they were pretty awesome and the rice cake with shredded beef    eh  very gummy the rice cakes were and there was like no beef   two strands maybe   no one checked on us at all during the meal and it was just eh   i mean i did love the soup dumplings tho    i just wish the whole experience was better !
since i only had the dumplings at this flushing chinatown spot  i'll hold back one star  until i'm there again  the dumplings were outstanding! one word of warning though  the "pork buns" are really pork dumplings and they are filled with a warm  delicious broth  don't bite into one or you'll get doused! plop them in your mouth and enjoy  also  the veggie dumplings were outstanding  though no broth was encountered 
this used to be my fav soup dumpling place  the soup dumplings are always fresh and filled with soup  which is important! otherwise it would just be called dumplings  i always get 2 baskets of soup dumplings  a beef scallion pancake and a salty tofu soup   yes all for me   )but since i found a better soup dumpling place this place has lost all appeal to me  especially because it's really popular now and often there is a line out the door  check out my channel youtube com strictlydump… to find out which place has the best soup dumplings in the city 
love this place  first time hear ! make sure u come early ! this place is crazy packed ! family style food ! their portions are so big  try the seafood noodle soup   garlic cucumber   scallions pancakes ! is a must 
these are excellent soup dumplings!i tried the scallion pancake with beef  it is probably just me  but i don't like the sauce in there  pancake a bit oily  sauce made it taste off  guess i would prefer shredded pork with bbq  i will tried udon noodles or fried noodle next  the soup dumplings are amazing!!cash only  quick refills on tea  clean 
pay with exact change  every time i come here  they shortchange me by a few cents  i even got a dirty look from the cashier when i pointed out that she still owed me the rest of my change  it's not the amount of money that annoys me  it's the principle  seriously  if my bill is $10 96  that's what the business is entitled to get from me; if i pay with a twenty  i expect to get back $9 04  not $9   you just know they'd raise bloody hell if i decided to pay $10 90 of a $10 96 bill!let's do some fake asian math  shall we?i think nan xiang has a capacity of around 150 people  let's assume the cashier shortchanges each of 75 checks (to account for different sized parties) by $0 03 and that all the tables are turned over every hour for ten hours  they make $22 50 an hour just from those three extra cents  that's $157 50 in extra untaxed revenue they're stealing from their customers on a weekly basis  and $8190 every year   my indignance re  their shady money practices aside  the food is good  the soup buns  while no longer the orgasmic experience they once were  are still good  full of soup  nice flavor  tender  and the skins are toothsome  i used to like their beef filled scallion pancakes but the quality of this particular dish is really inconsistent  sometimes it's beautifully crisp  not greasy  and full of scallion pieces to complement the braised beef inside  at other times  the pancakes are heavy  drenched in oil  and devoid of scallion flavor or bits  i'm uninterested in playing the odds with this dish  so i no longer order it  it's too bad because when it's good  it's truly a wonder to taste  their hot pepper noodle soup is wonderful and something i'd order again  it's not at all spicy despite its name; the beef broth is rich and flavorful  though you should know there is msg in it  overall  nan xiang serves some excellent grub  they lost a star for their shady short changing and another for their inconsistent food quality 
great great great food! best scallion pancakes you will ever havethe rice cake is excellent (something i haven't tried before i went here   loved it)  it's casual modern dimsum  fun place to try out 
since we've been staying in flushing  we've gotten to try a ton a ton a ton of chinese food  which has been awesome  it's all concentrated around main st    sit down  take out  food courts  carts on the street  whatever you might need  it's all delicious and reasonably priced    and nan xiang is no exception  i'm assuming they're known for their dumplings  hence the "dumpling house " and it makes sense considering the bomb ness of their soup dumplings  they're perfectly cooked and all under $10 and man oh man are they good  we also tried the noodles and beef cake patties (i'm terrible  i should really get to know the names) but all the food was amazing! we left happily filled  but now for the three star rating    that service  man  i thought for a moment that it was because i was there and quite obviously didn't speak chinese   i get it  it's frustrating when someone who has no idea what things are or how to speak the language is trying to order  however  i was with my chinese speaking boyfriend and his mom and it was amazing how many times we were either straight up ignored or dismissed  we had to ask for water a million times before they finally brought it  and even to order our food  it took us a long time to get a waiter to stop for us  it seems pretty disorganized and while it's always busy  it's not a very large restaurant  throw a smile on   or not even that  at least get the orders right when we do order! that'd help me enjoy the overall experience of this place a lot more also cash only too!
the food is ok  but service is very slow  soup dumpling without provide spoon  no tea refill  and server is standing far  pass my table multi time without refilling my cups  hard to get a hold of server  but hey  this this a chinese restaurant in chinatown  who cares about service anyway  they only sell fast food  just eat and get the heck out asap 
first thing to order is the xiao long bao  about one or two trays per person  it is that good  it is dumplings with a soup inside the dumpling  the rest of the menu is gravy     but good gravy     
cash only but amazing xiao long bao  best i've had on the east coast!if you're in flushing  go!
by far my favorite soupy dumpling spot! been to joe's shanghai many times  for the distance and hassle  it's not worth it now after coming here  thin and very juicy crap soup dumplings    yum! they also have delicious cold spicy beef appetizers  would definitely recommend this place!
a new go to place in flushing  great food for a relatively budget friendly price  went in a day before chinese new year(just to look for tikoy) and a sunday and it was packed at 2pm  thumbs up with the sweet bean curd we had and the scallion pancake with beef  will recommend this place 
cold appetizerssoup dumplingslong lines in front of the doorsmall placechefs making their creations right in frontthis place is so good!!!
excellent scallion pancakes and pork soup dumplings (xiao long bao) at reasonable prices  probably the best soup dumplings i've tried in nyc 
lunch for two  had to wait 15 min for a table  we got seated in the inner room  it was crowded and we sat so close to next table that you can listen in to each others conversation  so this place is not for any intimate chat or dates we ordered a cold dish  beef tripe (spicy)  rice cake  salty cabbage and fish noodle soup and also the famous soup dumplings the cold dish came first  it was delicious  the spiciness was not overpowering  i'd like more of this yummy cold beef  then came the noodle soup which was mehh    the noodles was soggy and the soup bland  worse was the fish that tasted earth dirt  i forgot to ask what kind of fish they used  i tried to finish it but the mudtaste grew stronger!the rice cake stir fry was a bit oily but still ok  reminds me of the hk style beef noodle soup dumplings finally arrived but by then i was pretty full  it was ok but remember i've had better before or it might be i'm not that hungry  i'd probably come back for another try and order less food the other buns that came last we just packed them with us the service was ok but it was busy so it took awhile before we got the bill  when it finally came it was the wrong bill  haha    more wait to get it fixed but they apologized when we got the right bill and said it was busy so our table got mixed up 
found my go to spot for soup dumplings! wait on the weekend is bit long  but totally worth it  standard pork dumplings are $6 for 6 of them  pretty reasonable price  great place for group or causal dining 
authentic chinese shanghainese cuisine! i've been coming to this places for years now and they've expanded the restaurant over the years but they're still busy as ever and sometimes the lines go out the door and down the street  definitely plan on a wait when you come  the menu is has stayed the same  with cold dishes like fried gluten and preserved veggies and edamame  hot appetizers like scallion pancake and salty douhua  small entrees like xiao long bao soup dumplings which is what they're known for and other chinese stir fry dishes  the dumpling skin is made fresh and thin which takes skill and they're steamed perfectly  the service is on and off because they're so busy but for the most part  they're quick on getting your order and very quick on serving it  the chive and leek pockets are not as good as i'd like them to be cause the skin is too thick and the stuffing is too little  the soy milk here is very rich and delicious!
i surely am a fan of nan xiang dumpling   for our recent very very short stay in flushing  we actually went there twice   which is pretty amazing since there must be like more than two dozen restaurants eateries i wanted to try   the first night we arrived in nyc  i wanted to go because  well  i really really want some good xiao lun bao   i've heard of nan xiang (of course) and have tried them in vancouver  bc (in a food court)   so when i learned our hotel is a mere 2 min walk from this place  it was a no brainer i ordered the xlb  dumplings  and wonton   and it was a nice 1 am feast (really bad for me  i know)   the food was not the best i've ever had  but it's pretty darn good   so the very next morning  we went back because i wanted to try their breakfast as well   and by breakfast  i mean soy milk  chinese donut  another round of xlb and pan fried small buns   if i live in flushing  i'd probably come here every week    
i dream of these xlb   oh why do i have to live so far away from flushing? the stern looking owner or manager guy who tended the front was fun to watch  he looked like he was about one or two sentences away from unleashing some can of kung fu whoop ass on any customer that pushed him slightly the wrong way  maybe this place gets so busy  and rightly so  that the pressure on him is too much  whatever  what they've got going works well  and the food is a joy  in additional to the ethereal xlb's (and i liked the pork better than the crab and pork)  the stir fried rice cake with pork was really delicious  this is a perfect place for a comforting chinese breakfast to start your day off right  just make sure to keep your mouth shut around that guy in the front and no sudden moves  i don't need him going postal on your skinny butt and ruining my favorite xlb restaurant!
wish i tried more! the dumplings melted in your mouth  so easy to pop those suckers back!
quality  authentic chinese soul food! you will not be disappointed  i promise  i brought a friend here and we ordered veggie dumplings  warm soymilk  fried dough  shumai  scallion pancakes  and fried (soup) dumplings (?) (not sure what they're called in english but trust me  everything was good ) come here!
this is a long overdue review because i came here after a flushing yelp event and karaoke way way back in early march with a group of yelpers  though  i remember distinctly what i ordered and all of it being delicious and having enough food to take home for seconds the next day  steph ordered the traditional soup dumplings  which i tried one of and the skins were cooked perfectly and the taste was on point  i had ordered pan fried pork buns and they were way more enormous than i had expected with a generous sprinkling of sesame seeds on the top of each round dough ball  dumplings and buns is where this place excels  noodles and soup were just average  at least  from what i remember anderson saying about his noodle soup it was just alright  my shanghai panfried udon noodles were just alright as well and on the point of being bland and boring  i could have left satisfied without ordering them  one thing you should get though are their scallion pancakes! they were perfection and some of the best i've ever tasted 
excellent food at very reasonable prices  we had the soup dumplings  the scallion pancakes with pork and the pan fried udon noodles  all delicious!
this is the best xiao long bao in flushing areai gave this place 4 stars bcoz of the service was horrible and the server was not friendly and gave us shitty face not even smile but atleast i got the good food
+ amazing xlb  most soup i've ever seen in one of these  only thing i think din tai fung does better is the thinness of their skin + scallion pancakes were fantastic~ other chinese dishes were solid~ get there early
tasty food  especially the spicy beef tripe  prices are in line with the prices of a lot of places in flushing  that is  very cheap  nothing much to say or expect with the interior or ambience  you're only going for the food  i would recommend what they're famous for  the xiao long bao  it's one of the better ones in nyc 
cheap  fast  and delicious  i make sure to get my soup dumpling fix in before any flight  love the red bean puffs too 
cash only!!!!chinese food here are very delicious   portion is very generous   the wait doesn't take very long  so just be patient   you will get the seat very soon really recommend the soy milk!
the food was okay  but it gave me gingivitis afterwords probably due to them not fully cooking the food and not removing the bacteria from the meat this place sucks!!!! watch out!!! beware!!!!
delicious xiao long bao   not the best i've ever had but it certainly hits the spot  we had the salty soy milk and fried dough which was great  the pan fried dumpling could have been left on the pan longer  the service was quick and food came out reasonably fast  mof note  my neighboring customers had their orders mixed up with another table and they were able to fix it though the customers were grumpy because the waitress kept insisting they didn't mess up 
verdict  food is pretty good  but the service really slow i would rate this above joe's shanghai but below kung fu xiao long bao  the xiao long bao here are typically pretty good  the texture of the skin is done well and the flavors are there  however i generally find the other dishes are too oily  namely the shanghai pan  fried noodles and the beef pancake( both dishes which i consider a staple in shanghai cuisine) this would definitely be 4 stars if it the service wasn't so slow  last time i went on a busy saturday  it took more than 30 minutes for the xiao long bao  and took forever for us to get our check after we asked for it  overall not bad if i'm in the area  but if i'm craving xlb i'm going to kung fu 
only came here for the soup dumplings   and i can say that i was not disappointed at all i've had my fair share of soup dumplings   from super authentic ones in shanghai to famous ones from din tai fung and joe's shanghai  compared to those  these from nan xiang are definitely the best soup dumplings i've had in america  the thickness of the skin is perfect  almost too thin that you really have to demonstrate technique when picking up the dumplings or you'll be left soupless  the soup porkfat is amazing and so delicious  every dumpling was consistent in quality  i normally don't dig the crab + pork soup dumplings  but got it here just to try  so happy i did because they were bomb  i highly recommend them  but of course you can't go wrong with the classic pork flushing is far far away and there's almost always a wait here  but i'll make the trip over any day to get myself 2 orders of these little pieces of heaven 
fasten yer seat belt  this place if off the charts delicious! if you're ordering dumplings or baozi be prepared to wait 15 20 minutes  that's just the time it takes to steam them up fresh  otherwise check out the beef noodle soup  which is delectable!
great late night food that's also inexpensive my only complaint is that the place gets so busy  that you're seated real close to other customers   privacy is always lacking 
solid 5 5    great alternative if you're in queens and in the mood for xlb  the rice cakes were cooked to perfection and the broth in the dumplings was just right  will be coming back often 
the service was really bad here  the crab and pork soup dumplings were mediocre  joe's shanghai has better dumplings  take your business elsewhere 
love the soup dumpling  must try steamed crab meat  & pork buns mmmm!! also love the fried dumpling  service is fast prices are great   family friendly 
probably one of the best if not the best soup dumpling place in ny  here you'll see the live action grandmas making the dumplings from scratch  one rolls out the doll into tiny proportionate circles  the other applies the filling and forms the dumpling  the last prepared the cabbage and placement for steaming  dream team of soup dumpling making the rest of the menu is really good and incredibly authentic  there isn't anything here i don't like  well  except for the scallion pancakes   it's very greasy  dumplings better than shanghai manor? yes  everything else better than shanghai manor? nope  but this place is the spot to hit if you get that soup dumpling shanghainese craving 
not the best xiaolongbao i've had  i think joes shanghai is much better  but the scallion pancake with beef was delicious  but not enough beef inside  seafood with noodle was good but a bit greasy    overall a solid place 
this place never disappoints  winter  spring  summer  or fall  this has been and still is my go to place for xiao long bao when i get the craving for it  the service is quick and there's enough room to get seated quickly  and who doesn't want to eat breakfast food for dinner?!the scallion pancakes with beef are a must have with your soup dumplings  deep fried goodness  you won't regret it!if you're looking for soup dumplings without having to wait a long time during peak hours like you would at joe's shanghai  give this place a try  cash only  so be prepared!
i had the best xiao long bao in ny there! everything we had was very fresh  steamed vegetable dumpling was my favorite! this place totally lives up to the hype!
i came here expecting amazing food since i read all the yelp reviews  my boyfriend and i were seated quickly by the host who didn't even get up to greet us  it's flushing so i didn't expect much service anyway  we ordered the beef scallion pancakes  fried dough  hot soybean milk  fried shanghai lo mein  and two orders of the crab and pork soup dumplings  our food was pretty good until we saw a bug in our noodles    the waiter replaced the dish as soon as we told them overall  i wouldn't go back  the soup dumplings are were flimsy and the skin was easily broken  the dumplings were decent at best  i don't know what the hype is 
overall our meal was good   we were seated at the same time as two other couples at three tables side by side   we sat in between the two couples   the two couples ordered quickly  but then the server forgot to take our order afterwards  we kept trying to flag the server   the two tables had their food served and our order was still not taken   once we got our order placed  food came out relatively quickly   we got   spicy wontonsscallion pancakes with beefpork soup dumplingscrispy noodles with shredded porkspicy wontons were ok  not at all spicy   don't expect too much from the scallion pancakes   when i first took a bite  i liked it   maybe it was the sweetness to it?  then i didn't later   soup dumplings and the crispy noodles were great   will definitely be back to try some other dishes 
the crab meat soup dumplings were delicious and juicy  but the service was terrible  my friend and i only ordered 3 orders of the crab meat soup dumplings and an order of the scallion pancakes  but somehow all the waiters (we spoke to like 4 different people) each forgot to check up on our soup dumpling order so we did not get them for about 30 minutes  during this time  several large groups came in (it was after 11pm) and the waiters were nowhere to be found in our particular dining room  finally  when i managed to flag down a more diligent waiter  he checked up on our order and realized that it was either never inputted or given to the wrong person so he finally inputted the orders and said 6 minutes  then  on top of that  he only brought us 2 orders when we ordered 3 and when i told yet another waiter that we had in fact ordered 3 soup dumplings  he grunted at me in a yes i know way  then i see him enter the third order finally in the back  after eating all of the dumplings  the 3rd order was still no where to be seen so i decided to cancel the order because we were tired of waiting  when i asked to cancel  several waiters gave me a look as if i had troubled them when they were the ones who completely messed up my order in the first place! the waiter had the audacity to come back to me and exclaim that there was only a minute left on the dumplings  but i said it doesn't matter we had waited like 45 minutes for this 3rd order so we no longer wanted it  i wanted to leave 0 tip but it is the holiday season  mistakes happen  but they do not have attentive  polite waiters  if one waiter would have listened to us early on or checked up on our table that only had scallion pancakes (isn't that weird) we would have resolved this problem a lot quicker 
can i give this place a 6*?! we went here after going the night session of the us open since it is only one more stop on the subway  i love shanghai soup dumplings  but my wife is not the biggest fan of them (she loves all other dim sum)  so i was certainly going to get those dumplings when i came with her cousin  we ordered 2 six packs of the shanghai dumplings along with cucumbers for postering sake  they were really good  her cousin was raving about it and how we had to add this onto our us open tradition 
this place is always packed but the wait is never very long  the soup dumplings are amazing  you will crave it! the price is so cheap too and they have a laege variety to choose from  this place makes putting up with the traffic worth it  it is that good! my aunt and i ate here were stuffed and didn't even spend 30 bucks
ordered the crab and pork soup dumpling    verrrrry delicious and hot! (temp wise which = fresh)  the scalion pancake with beef was ok  but different  service was great  and will come back for sure!
someone help me  i cannot stop eating here  their "soup dumplings" put joe shanghai's to shame  their crispy noodles with chicken have a crunch and a kick to die for  their scallion pancakes have the right balance of flavors  i really cannot say enough  the best places are often hole in the wall ones such as these  highly recommend!
cheap eats  i came here twice within a a month  good food  may be a little oily  the soup dumplings are a staple  must order them with or without crab meat  the beef noodles were my type of spicy but it was too oily  scallion pancakes were decent  the oyster sause may have ruined the taste  lo mien was bomb  and the peanut sause steamed dumplings were delicious  
so i have joined the battlefield between this place and joe's shanghai  here's my verdict xlb  unfortunately  joe's shanghai wins  but just barely  everything was almost exactly the same  except two things  the soup has a lot more msg in js (nx wins this one)  but the skin in nx is much more thicker  to a point if you let it cool down it will turn hard  the latter part is a bigger factor for me as i'm a slow eater  we ordered two rounds of xlb and by the time i started the second time the skin was already hard other food  this place has a lot more variety for my non pork eating mom and grandma compared to js  and they tasted much better as well  scallion pancakes  beef tripe  and the veggie dumplings were some of the other things we ordered  along with chicken wine and beef noodles  all were tasty and enjoyed by us all so who won this battle? well i guess it depends on who i'm with  i'll go back to js if i'm not with my mom or grandma next time i'm in nyc  if i am  this place works for me as well 
came here the other day after not having been here in a while and wow the xlb (soup dumplings) got smaller and there was lack of pork in the shanghai fried noodles  it looks like i got soy sauce stir fried noodles  i think there are better competitors out there now on main street and in bayside 
if i were living in this area  i would go here for dinner almost every night  a variety of delicious  authentic chinese food for amazing price  you pay a little over $20 for three dishes and two people will have very satisfying portion  i would definitely come back here! *cash only 
my friends and i all agree this is the best xiao long bao in flushing!turnip puffs are nice treat also try the cold appetizer of spicy beef!!!lots of room now available since they expanded 
went there for brunch on a sunday morning approximately 11 ish   real quick seating  with virtually no wait time   this place is the typical flushing spot  no frills decor  semi cordial service  but fast and straight to the point   i had the obligatory xiao long bao  scallion pancakes with beef and the spicy beef noodle soup   everything was tasty  especially the soup dumplings   the missing star is for the soup spoons were too small for the xiao long boas  the broth for the beef noodles wasnt as hot as i would have preferred   i would visit again
never had soup dumplings  yeah i know  craving dumplings in the area the likes of prosperity in chinatown  came across this place  upon reading their specialty is soup dumplings i had to give it a try  seated immediately with a few patrons  the most common thing on most tables were the dumplings and scallion pancake  great  got steamed pork buns and pan fried dumplings (it being called steamed pork buns threw me off a little )pan fried came really quick     like too quick but were pretty okay  none like the magical ones i've had before but decent  then came the soup dumplings  since being a noobie i glanced at the other table to see the best way to eat it delicious soup and skin wasn't doughy  easy to break through and enjoy worth the experience and glad they set the bar for me 
best soup dumplings in new york!! service   if chris is your waiter  he'll take great care of you  soft spoken and extremely kind  place is open late and if you get there before the dumpling makers leave they'll serve you  scallion pancake sliced beef is delicious  get the traditional pork soup dumplings and the pan fried dumplings  pork chop noodle soup and seafood crispy noodles are great for sharing  don't waste your time at the over priced spots in manhattan  this is the go to!!
i was a little skeptical b c of the hype and the lines out the door and the high percentage of non chinese customers  but  we had a really solid meal and i plan to go back this weekend i'm not a soup dumpling expert  but i thought these were really good  the skin seemed a little thick to me  but the broth was nice and hot and the flavor was balanced we also had seafood w  crispy noodles  rice cake w  chicken  scallion pancakes  scallion pancakes stuffed with beef  and fried pork dumplings  everything was above average or really great  my favorites were the crispy noodles and scallion pancakes  honestly  i ate the scallion pancakes and understood what every other scallion pancake was striving for  the ones stuffed with beef were a bit too much for me  but everyone else loved them  the rice cake dish was also very good  um  i didn't try the pork dumplings b c my nephew finished them before i even realized they had arrived we went on a saturday evening and the wait was less than 15 minutes  if you find that you have to wait for a while  i suggest sending someone from you party two blocks down the street to white bear for some wontons with chili oil to eat while you wait  parking is always an issue in this area  we lucked out and got a spot in the municipal lot across the street  if all else fails  park at skyview mall for $3 and walk 
i am sure that you heard a lot about this famous restaurant  they always have the best soup dumplings that people love ever  the soup dumplings (crab and pork) would definitely make you all feel so yummy and warm whenever is right time for you all  love sucking soup from the top of the dumpling where you ate first before eating whole dumpling  that's what people did that way traditionally  beef scallion pancake is very delicious and sweet food!  sweet soy milk soup is very good and for my breakfast time    )i hope you really enjoy it!
this place deserves a 0 1 star  i have been here so many times but the last time i ate here it was by far the worst experience  we got our crispy pan fried noodles and a cockroach!!! wtf?! girlfriend  called the waiter over and told them discreetly    we continue eating the other dishes we ordered  our crispy noodles comes back!! but this time the noodles is not crispy at all?!? geez i wonder why??? they gave us back the same noodles!!! wtf??! tried to lie to us saying they threw out the old order but sorry can't believe you!! bad zombie waiter service!! i usually don't care but don't lie and serve back a dish with a cockroach! come'on man!!take that garbage back!! no thanks and will not come back!! this restaurant can pay yelp to remove or hide this post!! but if i can save another from this horrible experience then it is worth my time posting it!!!!!
always have great soup dumplings  and cheap but horrible service  they bring it food separately  i had a dumpling coming out when i was waiting for a check 
we needed a filling meal before attending the us open  so i was glad we had the chance to try nan xiang  we arrived around 12 30pm on a monday and waited for no more than 10 minutes  the menu is only two pages  so it was quick deciding which items to order  of course  we get one order of the pork xiao long baos  along with shanghai shao mai  scallion pancake with sliced beef  and crispy noodles with shredded chicken the crispy noodles came to the table first  they were definitely crispy and crunchy prior to mixing with the overly salty  yet savory sauce  there were a lot of napa cabbage shreds  but chicken and mushroom were definitely lacking the scallion pancake with sliced beef was extremely greasy  but very crispy and delicious  thin beef slices were paired with hoisin sauce  i think  the pancake itself was very starchy and filling  the shanghai shao mai was very filling as well because the shanghai version is made with glutinous rice  (i'm more familiar with cantonese versions made with only meat )and lastly  the most anticipated dish for this restaurant visit  finally arrives about 15 minutes after our first dish  the xlbs are made fresh to order  and they were huge! you're even given a pair of tongs to pick them up  they barely fit on the spoon  and when breaking the skin to release all the soup  the soup practically fills the whole spoon! soup is delicious and flavorful  as well as the juicy pork ball  we were thinking of getting another order  but we didn't have the time to wait our total was $23  including tax and tip  so it comes to $11 50 person  which i must say is a great deal for lunch!
yum yum yum! my mouth is already watering from thinking about this place  my friend and i were craving soup dumplings on a sunday afternoon  so with a little bit of help from yelp and eddie huang  we came across this place   )we arrived around 2pm and waited about 15 minutes to get seated  we took a look at the menu (which conveniently had pictures) and were fixed on getting pork soup dumplings  seafood crispy noodle  scallion pancake with beef  and two orange sodas (boo to sink water)  pork soup dumplings  jesus christ  i don't even care if i look like an idiot trying to open my small mouth wide open to fit this delicious dumpling into my mouth  well worth it  especially after giving it a nice sauna in the soy sauce and letting it cool down after a minute (high five if you get my reference)  seafood crispy noodle  yummy! i liked the texture of the gooey and savory seafood against the crispness of the noodle  nice balance  tastes like a snack though haha  delicious nonetheless scallion pancake with beef  ok  i like my scallion pancakes with more    scallion  but the beef was good and so was the brown sauce  would've preferred it with more scallion though!food was solid  service was ok  but was quick to bring out orders  i just wish they accepted card  my friend and i were short of cash  so         we couldn't tip  i promise i'll double tip next time so please don't not seat me  because your food is amazing and i definitely would return   '(
it was a busy friday night but we only had about a twenty minute wait and it was well worth it  we had a few appetizers and soup dumplings (the best! even got an extra order!) as well as our entrees and everything was excellent and very well priced  
compared the dumpling quality from when it first opened to now  the quality declined   nonetheless still delicious   kind of hard calling the waiter when it's super crowded (i awkwardly chased after him once)   they used to give you a little saucer of black vinegar and ginger but now they give you a saucer with ginger and you pour the vinegar yourself (that small vessel on the side of the table is not soy sauce)   not all tables have this so sometimes you will have to share the love   in all honesty this is not the best xiaolong bao place in flushing but it's pretty darn good and i'd come here if i'm in main street 
scallion beef roll is the best  get the salty soy milk and the oil donut to dip it in  sour salty soft and crunchy  of course their soup dumplings are a must  the skin is super thin  and each bite is just perfect  service leaves more to be desired  but    it's flushing so it's adequate
it was a kind of weird experience with the language barrier (not all the people working there speak english) and i kind of felt like an outcast with all the other asian people eating there together  speaking various other languages and i felt like the only spanish guy within a 2 mile radius of the place at the time  but the food is great and the service was good  i tried the udon noodles which were awesome and a good large portion size  a circular bamboo steamer full of thin steamed pork buns which had an amazing flavor  as well as a plate of pan fried pork buns which had a nice thick dough outer shell with the perfect consistency  if they took the liquidy pork center of the thin steamed version and combined it with the nice outer shell of the pan fried version they would have the perfect pork bun in my opinion  or you can buy both like i did and have a feast  would recommend this place to anyone thats visiting or lives in the area 
best soup dumplings in flushing period   you can barely go wrong with anything on the menu and watching the ladies make the soup dumplings from scratch is a treat 
my favorite soup dumpling place besides the originals in china! ugh it's just perfection    some people say it's a little too oily and then there's that complain that the line on weekends are out the door (though they've expanded)    but i still say 5 stars because it sure is tasty! the cold appetizers like glutinous dough and the rice cakes are also amongst my favorite dishes there  yummmyy
this rating is simply for terrible service  young lady had the nerve to chase customers out of the restaurant charging additional tip on top of what was already given  never coming back again 
the food here is delicious and definitely worth trying  i had the shanghai noodles with chicken and a order of regular soup dumplings and the crab meat dumplings  the soup that were in the dumplings was hot and the meat inside was tender  i'd give this place 5 stars but i still would prefer joe's shanghai over this place  and we had to remind a waitress 20 minutes in about our order 
my family and i have been here a few times and the food is always delicious!!! the soup dumpling's meat and soup were extremely hot and flavorful  in addition  to the soup dumplings we had an assortment of noodles which were delicious and i would highly recommend the noodles  overall the food was excellent and every time i come here the food is constantly excellent 
so much good food for so cheap!!nothing i can say to complement their awesomeness however be wary of the soy sauce  it's super vinegary
having been here a time or two (or ten)  i've got something to say about you  nan xiang dumpling house the succulent soup filled dumpling (otherwise known as xiao long bao) is a double edged sword which can only be mastered through years of practice and experience  as you pierce the skin  a waterfall of soup will pour out  scalding your unprepared mouth while washing your taste buds with a overload of savory goodness that will keep you coming back for more  this burn is merely one's initiation into the xiao long bao club as there will be many more to come back to the actual restaurant  nan xiang's soup dumplings are pretty bomb  but i've gotta give them a 4 5 5  i grew up on joe's shanghai's soup dumplings and these simply don't cut it for me  they're good  but they lack the savoriness that i crave in a xiao long bao and as many chances as i give this place  their dumplings fall a little short every time that said  it is usually a toss up between this place and joe's depending on personal tastes and i wholeheartedly recommend you try them out 
the food is good   it really is  the soup dumplings and shanghai pan fried udon is to die for but as they say  ignorance is bliss   the last time i ventured in this establishment i heard rats in the ceiling scampering around and squeaking   i genuinely love the food but i have to rethink about coming back here 
if gmama wants xiao long bao then gmama gets its! waited for 30 minutes to be seated  then another 25 minutes to be served  food is good  but the service and wait time sucked  we ordered the sweet soy milk  with chinese donut  and the xiao long bao to share  the food was enjoyable but the wait was just too long  enjoy!
eat here  trust me   you won't regret it   pros  the most delicious soup dumplings that have ever touched my tastebudscons  awkward seating arrangements with strangers 3inches from you  verdict  must try
this is solely for the beef role   i waited 30 minutes for this thing  but it was worth it   the pancake was thick and perfect in texture   the beef was only one slice thick  but was so flavorful  that this was definitely enough for me   i think the sauce was simply hoisin  and though i'm sure they could've gotten a little fancier on this  they didn't really need to since it complimented the roll rather well as is one thing   they're extremely popular  so placing the order took awhile   also picking it up took almost 10min  b c although my order was sitting there  large groups were taken care of before i could pick it up   anyways  you never go to an asian restaurant for the service   i would come back to this restaurant for the beef roll 
delicious soup dumplings is all you need and want here  ok you can also get the beef scallion pancakes and rice noodles  come here early to avoid the crowd  still considered one of the best xlb in ny in my opinion 
wow   they've been michelin approved for many years  impressive  but that doesn't sway my opinion my friends i came here specifically to try their shanghai (soup) dumplings  we ordered that  an order of shengjian bao (huge pan fried dumplings)  and pig ears as an appetizer  the shanghai dumplings were average; the skins were a little thicker than what i prefer  the soup inside was okay  but the pork filling was missing something that i couldn't quite place my finger on  oh well  the shengjian bao were humongous  the skins were extra thick and doughy  they looked like pan fried pork buns to me  they were interesting to eat though  because i've never had them before  the pig ears were served cold in some sort of chili oil  they were pretty good  chewy and spicy  service was pretty slow and not very attentive  felt like the entire establishment was a little overrated for me; not sure what all the fuss is about 
best chinese food in the country  no wait and much better than joe's shanghai in manhattan soup dumplings are juicy and flavorful  if i lived here in ny i will be a regular here  hands down its the best in ny  stop reading the rest of the reviews and try it for yourself 
yum yum  i really like the xiao long bao here  now  here's a pro tip  the crab and pork xiao long bao and just pork xiao long bao pretty much taste the same  so if you want to save money  i'd recommend just ordering the pork xiao long bao oh i thought the tongs that come along with the xiao long bao is pretty innovative as it helps moving the dumplings into the soup spoon  if you are not that well versed with delicately using chopsticks for grabbing the soup dumplings  the tongs certainly help 
at first glance  it's looks like a small restaurant but it actually has two more rooms adjacent to the main one  nonetheless  it's still really crowded!! we got here around 2 and we had to wait 10 minutes (which isn't bad at all considering the rave this place has)  the menu conveniently has pictures and is easy to read  we ordered the scallion pancake with beef  pork fried buns  crab soup dumplings  pork soup dumplings  and shui mai  my first impression for all the food is how oily and greasy it is   the scallion pancake with beef had so much oil that it was pooling on the plate  i came here for the huge rave about the soup dumplings but maybe it was just me and i was having a bad day or something but the dumplings tasted like nothing special  but i did overall enjoy the crab ones  shui mai was basically sticky rice  pork buns were good but greasy  overall  filling but i don't plan on returning 
this place definitely captured my heart in an instant  it was as close to love at first sight as you can get  i've passed by this place numerous times and never once thought about going in  my boyfriend and i arrived at around 10am on a saturday and was immediately seated  however  there was already a pack of people there before us and a hefty line was starting to form as we finished eating  we ordered one order of the crab meat & pork soup dumplings and wow   we were definitely caught way off guard  it was super soupy and delicious and the filling was so tender and warm  next off was the rice cake  my boyfriend usually isn't a fan of rice cake but this is the first dish that he couldn't stop picking at himself! (please believe me when i say that when my boyfriend does not like something even the tiniest amount  that he makes a dramatic show out of chopsticks hitting everything but the food) but this did not happen even once during our entire time here  the beef noodle soup from what i remember (as i myself couldn't stop digging into the rice cake) had the perfect amount of spiciness and went down very smoothly  it was quite refreshing drinking the broth after munching on a bunch of rice cake 
this place is another xiao long bao place that i tried  not bad but also not good at the same time  nothing special  my point is that if i have to pay for food  it better taste at least in similar level or better than my own cooking  i rather to goto the food court a block away because at least i don't have to pay the tip and additional tax on the food that already cost a bit more but not really better 
my expectations were raised from so many people claiming that these xlbs were the best in ny  after trying them  i would say they are very good but it's debatable whether or not they're the best in the city  we got the ones with crab meat and pork   the skin had the right  thickness and the flavors were on point   4 5 yelp com user_local_phot… the scallion pancake with beef was disappointing  they were nothing like the beef rolls i've had in la  this version had only 1 pathetic looking  thinly sliced piece of beef laid in the middle of the pancake  and that one piece of beef wasn't even long enough to cover the pancake from end to end! the scallion pancake itself was extremely doughy and bland   i couldn't decide whether the hoisin sauce made this dish better or worse  i would call this a poor man's beef roll  2 5 yelp com user_local_phot… we also got rice cake w mixed seafood  not bad but quite oily  i don't understand why so many restaurant make this dish oily   i know it's possible to make it flavorful without putting in so much oil cuz i've had it  theirs weren't as oily as joe's shanghai though  so i was thankful for that at least  3 5 yelp com user_local_phot… the place is small but attracts a lot of tourists as it's featured in the michelin guide  so there's usually a wait   as we were trying to enter there were some tourists trying to drag their suitcases out of the restaurant   not an easy feat given how narrow the entrance is  not worth the hassle for me fyi  menu  yelp com user_local_phot…
this place definitely has some delicious shanghai food  however  "the best soup dumpling of nyc" title is very subjective  i still feel like joe's shanghai has more flavorful soup dumplings what i love about their soup dumplings is that the skin is super sturdy and will not break  furthermore  the soup is very clear and does not have the greasy porky taste of most soup dumplings  their other dishes are standard  the rice cakes are a must try!
stumbled upon this place  totally auth flushing experience  i hope it stays in business  it would be a shame if a taco bell opened in its place rice cake & cucumbers are top choice appetizers  byob as far as i can tell 
the steam soup dumping was great but be careful   cause when mine came 4 out of 6 has no soup inside   i thought was normal    that i asked the waitress   she said to tell them so they could replace it   what i try to say is if u look like a tourist they will give u the broken one with no soup in it !
there was a line to be seated and we were told 20 mins  we got seated in about 5 mins  sat down to tea being poured right away  placed our order and our food came out fast ! (although not all of it came out together) this place runs like well oiled machine  food  spicey beef and tripe (yikes) it was my first time trying tripe it was ok  didn't taste like much  it was a little chewy  the dish had very good spice i just didn't like it being cold  so i only tried it once and i was good  veggie dumplings were ok a little bland  pan fried pork buns were awesome ! came out super hot and had a crunchy bottom  udon noodles were great if you like lomein i would definitely suggest ordering the pan fried udon noodles it's like lomein on steroids  beef scallion pancake was also very good  flaky  and super flavorful with hoisin sauce inside  (both the noodles and pancakes were slightly on the oily side) soup dumplings were great and also very hot  seafood soup is a very good deal for the price for around $7 you get a huge bowl of soup filled with noodles and a variety of seafood like shrimp and scallops  the broth was delicious and the shrimp were cooked perfectly and not rubbery  service was prompt  tea was constantly being refilled  everyone just seems to love this place (kids included)  you will have to ask for forks if you can't use chopsticks  i will definitely be back 
i went there because people have been telling me how authentic the soup dumpling is  i was really excited to try it but was slightly disappointed in the end (maybe my expectation was too high)  the skin was well done but the flavor could be elevated  that being said  i loved the soy milk  the rice cake was not bad but slightly greasy  note  cash only 
the waitress totally ruined my diner  i come thank to the michelin guide  first impression was good  the place is crowded  the order is taken fast  but after she never come with the tea  we had to beg her for it  same thing with the sauce but we get it from other costumers  then a part of our meal didn't come  that was enough   the please and next  i will rather chose again galaxy dumplings than this place  the overall experience is much better 
i visited nan xiang as part of a flushing dumpling tour  it was definitely my favorite spot  it feels more authentic than joe's shanghai  it's not gigantic  but wasn't too crowded and was clean  also it's the place with the chinese signs and all the michelin and zagat stickers in the windows in case you aren't sure if you found the right spot the food was great  the soup dumplings are piping hot and have a thin skin with a very savory filling  the crab and pork dumplings are very savory  but there were some small bits of shell in some of our dumplings  not really too big of a deal  the pork dumplings have a bacon porky taste  which is incredible  they also make the best scallion pancakes i have ever had  they are crispy and light  not greasy or dense like most places  we also got hot soy milk  which would have probably been better with the the service was decent  but the price was great  we had 5 orders of soup dumplings and two of scallion pancakes with beers and soy milk for under $50  really delicious meal too 
it is one of the most reliable dumpling houses in new york city  the crowds are pretty ridiculous in the evenings and on the weekends but things move pretty quickly  the service is spotty but that should be a given with the volume they make and you just need to be a little more pushy than usual 
didn't compare to the hype  very greasy and slimy  i would stick to chinatown or even vanessas dumplings to be honest  service was rushed and uninterested 
cheaper and quicker place to go if you want soup dumplings on a winter evening  and don't want to wait for a seat in joe's shanghai for dinner  they are just as good as ones you get at joe's their spicy pig ear cold appetizer is a good side dish to share  but all else is pretty average  don't expect to go in asking too many questions or for recommendations  service is efficient and to the point  but english  like many places in flushing  is barely understood here 
this restaurant had great dim sum and the service was okay  the soup dumplings were my favorite! overall this place is a good spot  but the only true downside is that they only accept cash 
the service is pretty typical snappy and not happy but the beef scallion pancakes are amazing and so are the pork and crab soup dumplings so i'm willing to put up with a sour face
way better than joe's for the little lantern dumplings  and a wider selection of side dishes as well!
we only waited 20 minutes  staff was friendly  food was amazing  definitely worth the trip! we'll be back again  )
can't believe we took the metro on our layover in nyc to get some good food!  we love good food and know nyc has them!  given our time constraint  we decided to go into flushing and try this restaurant  i have to say i'm a bit disappointed   the xlbs were good but everything else was ok and disappointing including the scallion pancake with sliced beef and stir fried noodles  cash only!
yes  i know there's a "c" restaurant inspection in the window outside yes  i also know it's always incredibly crowded and the wait can be up to 30 minutes on the weekends but  nan xiang dumpling house still deserves 5 stars because how amazing the food always is  the xiaolongbao (soup dumplings)  with their delicate  thin skin and rich soup   are probably my favorite in the entirety of nyc  you won't find shriveled  mushy xiaolongbao here ever  i'm also a huge fan of their "langbu" (cold dishes appetizers)  my favorites are the jellyfish and radish (though the jellyfish to radish ratio is a bit off)  the spicy beef tendon  and the cucumbers and garlic dishes  perfect for a semi balanced meal considering you're about inhale a ton of meat and carbs also try their soup noodles if you're in the mood for something even more filing and warm  the shredded pork and salted cabbage option is #1 in my book  but the dry noodles with chili oil and beef also rocks!just be patient and polite and the service will be great! don't be rude  guy code 
the food was decent  my friend and i ordered the scallion pancake  pork soup dumplings  crab soup dumplings  and the crispy seafood noodles  the soup dumplings were good in flavor  however the scallion pancakes were a little burnt and oily  not much to say about the crispy seafood noodles as they were as expected  service was not great as the waiters do not come check up on you or refill your tea unless you request for them  not a deal breaker  if you just want soup dumplings  then get the soup dumplings 
first off  the food is so good  i require at least one trip to this place every time i'm back from college  the food is filling and good (but at times heavy)  the cold dishes are good  but my favorites will always be xiao long bao (steamed pork dumplings with soup) and beef wrapped in pancake  yum! the "spicy wontons" weren't spicy in the least  the sesame sauce was sweet and nothing like the spicy wontons i had in asia  which were really spicy  but that is the only food complaint i have  service is spotty  there were times when the staff was very attentive and we had great service  other times staff was careless and brusque since there was a lot of business and didn't have time to pay attention to us  i'd say definitely go for the food  just don't expect to be treated like the only ones there  you'll definitely leave full and happy 
my family often tells me that i'm a terrible chinese daughter   not because i'm disrespectful or stay out past my curfew or date non chinese boys but because i have a sometimes strong aversion to chinese food   pick any other cuisine and i'm down for it (unless its ethopian   not a huge fan of the tang) i had plenty of good food in new york but nan xiang dumpling house was my favorite   weird right?  it's chinese!  it's cheap  delicious  and makes me want to eat vats of everything   it was 26 degrees one fine weekend in new york (i hear that temperature is not too uncommon) and slightly snowing   the boy and i wanted to eat something scrumptious and put something warm in our belly   the last time i was in new york  i went to another xiao long bao place and was satisfied   i wanted that experience again we drove here  parked in the target parking lot and then walked over (3 free hours of parking??  seems unheard of!)   this place is unassuming and we almost walked right past it   you walk inside and not to be totally racist  but there were a lot of chinese people enjoying a meal in there   ah  it must be pretty good   or at least cheap   and it was really good   and it was cheap   we had the (excuse my ignorance) fried donut strip things with the soy milk dipping sauce   we each had one serving but we could've easily done one to share   i then chose xiao long bao and the beef tendon noodle soup (spicy)   the former came with soy sauce & ginger and the latter came with pickled (garlicky?) vegetables   if i could fit more dumplings in my tummy  i would've   if i could've eaten the vat of vegetables  i would've   we did manage to polish off 3 4 of the vat they brought us; i'm pretty sure that's poor form   everything was delicious and all that food cost less than $20   seriously??  when the boy asked me how much tip to give  i told him to give lots      which was like $5   can't wait to come back to new york; not for the people (that's what i'm pretty sure i'm supposed to say) or the hot dogs or the pee smelling subway but for this place instead 
i stopped into nan xiang dumpling house having never had an asian dumpling in my life  i'm glad i did  nan xiang dumpling house sits amid a lot a restaurants that all look the same  a quite yelp search steered me to xiang after a quick look at the menu i ordered the pork & crab soup dumplings and the scallion pancake beef roll  complimentary hot tea is also served  the pancakes arrived first which honestly didn't look very interesting  one bite changed that  the seasoning and beef were excellent  tender with a bit of tartness it was unlike anything i had eaten  beef wrapped in some sort of scallion pastry  my only issue with the dish was the pastry that the beef was wrapped in  it was a bit thick and heavy  i would have preferred the same dish but with a thinner lighter wrapping  still i thoroughly enjoined the dish  next came the soup dumplings  like the scallion beef pancakes had never had a soup dumpling  the 6 dumplings arrived in a steamer basket  a word of warning  there is extremely hot broth inside the dumpling  place a dumpling in your spoon and bit off the top or place it on its side in your spoon and bite the side  which allows to broth to run into your spoon  place the dumpling in your plate  add a little ginger and black vinegar to the broth  amazing stuff  by now the dumpling has cooled just a bit  very good!note  cash only  inexpensive and fast service makes nan xiang dumpling house a great stop for lunch 
the soup dumpling here is just ok  the dumpling skin was a little thick for me and the soup inside taste just ok  a little sour i don't know why  scallion pancake wasn't a good choice as it had no flavor at all and no sauce to dip with it  as for me it's too thick  the good thing here was this place wasn't too crowded and me and my friend got a table quick  the service here was a 3 stars because there were only a few servers here  i didn't get my tea filled when i finished it  so there is a total 3 stars for all 
waiting time is very long  and it has been three time that what i wanted was not ordered by the waiter  food is good but service is really terrible 
i've been on a quest for the ideal soup dumpling  and this spot has it  arrived around 7pm on a rainy monday night and the restaurant was packed  we were lucky enough to get the last empty table in the place and within seconds we had hot tea in our cups and the waitress was ready to take our order  we decided to peruse the menu for a little bit before ordering  the three of us decided to order a few things to share  we ordered scallion pancakes  both types of soup dumplings  wontons in spicy sauce  and pan fried dumplings  the other person in our party ordered the noodles with scallion sauce  everything was incredible  the scallion pancakes were very fluffy  the wontons in spicy sauce had the slightest kick with this amazing sesame taste and i'm addicted  the pan fried dumplings were awesome  and lastly  the soup dumplings  i've tried about 4 places in flushing for these things and this place has the best around  we were served very quickly and everything came out hot  fresh  and delicious  our total bill came to $33 for 3 people  such a good deal 
i hate myself for always pigging out at this place  there's so many options  i can't help but to try a little of everything  scallion pancakes with beef  amazing  dumplings  amazing  rice cake  amazing  you get the point  and sharing a table with strangers is a plus  you never know who you'll sit next to  waiters could be a little more attentive  but it's hard to notice when you're two chopsticks deep in noodles 
cash only is kind of annoying that fact aside  i didn't think the pork soup dumplings were anything super special   i would not go out of my way to come here (which i did  as going to flushing is usually out of the way for most people)  the staff was kind of rude as well  just ehh for me 
when i dragged my boyfriend to flushing for a historic homes holiday tour a few weeks ago i had to promise him i'd find soup dumplings  yelp to the rescue! found this gem of a place (which i later found out is the go to soup dumpling place for most of my friends) and was not disappointed first  oh dear lord please don't try to drive here! you will spend hours looking for parking  and the main st  flushing 7 stop is only a few blocks away  wait it out on the train and save yourself the arguments now the good stuff  their scallion pancake is delicious! a bit greasy  but that's fine by me  it's super crispy which is definitely better than some of the limp ones i've had in my past we also ordered a noodle and beef dish  which was tasty but i found the sauce to be a bit thick and sweet for my taste  the boyfriend gobbled it up though finally  the soup dumplings (we got pork)  this was my first experience with soup dumplings  let's just say it was a struggle for me to figure out how to eat it  i think next time i need to watch a youtube video  i did however  watch a guy tackle these expertly at the table next to ours and tried to mimic him  i think i just don't have the finesse  i spilled most of my soup on the spoon and my lap  thankfully i managed to slurp up enough to know that this place has amazeballs soup dumplings  i'm addicted and planning a reunion visit for after the holidays  go!
our first two dinners were great  so my wife and i returned for a third meal  service was good but the meal was just ok  instead of the standard  excellent soup dumings  we ordered pork and vegetable dumplings in a spicy peanut sauce  the flavor was good  but oily  the noodles with shredded beef was tasty  but actually finding beef was a challenge  i still give it 4   stars based on the three visits  big bonus for low prices!
tasty dumpling house ! i ordered xiao long bao (crab + pork )  i guess the flavor is good  theres enough meat and they put shredded ginger on it  the skin is a little bit to thick and its kind of hard to eat it in one bite  other than that  everything is good vegetable dumpling  slightly bland  not so flavorful than the xiao long bao  the skin is way to thick for me  pork dumpling in a spicy sauce  omg  i love this  my favorite of all  they were served in a bowl and submered with very2 savory  sweet  sour and spicy sauce  the pork itself is not very porky  however  the dumpling is a little overcook for me  it just need 15 seconds less  but this dumpling is a must try! when you first come in  they will give you hot tea  and the service is not bad 
i've always knew of this spot but the wait is always too long  came on a rainy saturday and there was no line  yay!nothing compares to din tai fongs soup dumplings  but these are definitely better than joe shanghais pork dumplings (i prefer the crab dumplings there)  anyways the dumplings are just what you expect out of pork dumplings  not too greasy and the skin is just the right thicknessscallion pancakes with beef is tasty  they also put some of that peking duck sauce on it which makes the combination even better  rice cakes tasted just like typical shanghainese style stir fried rice cake  overall food is what you'd expect  i will be coming back! (if there's not a crazy long line) would love to try the breakfast foods!
this place is known for its soup dumplings and they don't disappoint  i've gone to the original in china and its comparable and you really can't find much better in nyc  the soup is delicious and the dumpling skins are not too thin or too thick  the meat is also great  but if you're really a soup dumpling fan its all about that piping hot soup! they get 4 stars instead of 5 bc aside from the soup dumplings  not many things jump off the menu  the service is also lacking  but expected at a chinese place like this  that also goes for the interior design and ambience  definitely don't come here expecting michelin star quality service and a bathroom attendant 
i suppose i had set my expectations too high when i came to nan xiang  i've heard from multiple people that this place blew joe's shanghai out of the water! i live in brooklyn and when i crave soup dumplings  i'm happy heading over to chinatown for some  i don't mind that joe's is crowded and touristy  heading out to flushing is a little bit of a hassle  if you've got a car  you have to take the bqe all the way to the end  and if you're not in a car  prepare to take the train for 1 5 hrs or more  the chinese buses provide another option for just $4 per person each way  so when i go out of my way to flushing  i guess i am psyching myself up for something amazing!to my delight  nan xiang was decidedly unpacked last weekend  it was not crowded  there were no tourists and we were seated promptly! my group ordered a round of sweet soy milk and happily guzzled it all down while we waited for our food  to judge nan xiang properly against joe's  we ordered the same things we normally would  what i got was not what i had expected crab soup dumplings   much better as compared to joe's! not as fishy tasting either!pork soup dumplings   i'm leaning in slight favor of joe's because i think their broth is better scallion pancakes   joe's scallion pancakes are 100x better than nan xiang  there was hardly any scallion in my pancakes at all and not flakey whatsoever fried beef udon   pretty much about the same everywheresome other things we tried here that i don't normally get at joe's were a cucumber and garlic dish that was so good and another dish that had mushrooms which was also really tasty  the service was much better than joe's  they weren't pushy at all  or rushing us  and actually let us sit and enjoy our food! and! my party of 9 people paid about $11 per head for dinner  now that is a stealllll!!all in all  it was definitely worth the trip out to flushing to try once but i don't know if i would come here again because it was sooooo far out there   if i was craving soup dumplings on a weekend when i know joe's would be packed  maybe  if i lived in queens  probably  but i'm a brooklyn girl!
although this place is known for its xiaolongbao (soup dumplings)  i really really love their shanghai pork & vegetable wonton soup  it's by far my favorite dish here other menu items are less stellar  but still  it's a good approximation for shanghai brunch foods  it's definitely worth the trip into flushing however  i'm taking off a star because how my most recent experience went me  i want the fried pancakes server  sorry we don't have that me  how about drunken chicken?server  that's also not available me  wait  what do you have then? did we come at a bad time?server  sorry  the menu you're looking at is outdated  we no longer serve that me  ok  how about shanghai wonton soup? i know you must have that server  actually    you'll have to wait 30 minutes for that  the guy who's in charge of making the wontons is still on his way me      we'll wait (the restaurant opens at 8am and we were there at 11 30am when we were told the wonton master isn't in yet   t_t)
i feel dirty putting this blasphemy on the record  but the best xiao long bao's i've ever had (including in my family's hometown of shanghai) was at the din tai fung in shanghai  an upscaley taiwanese joint in a bougie expat neighborhood  my grandparents are rolling in their graves  i'm putting that out there because i just don't think a lot of mainland chinese establishments put the requisite amount of care and effort into their xlbs anymore (whether in china or abroad)  with these low expectations of chinese restaurants in mind  i think nan xiang has done a decent job with their xlbs  they're still a bit oversized ("authentic" ones in shanghai are probably 2 3 the size)  but they have a fair amount of tasty soup and the skin is nice and thin delicate  my relatives seem to be able to taste the hint of crab in the crabmeat ones  but given that nan xiang puts so little crab in they crabmeat soup dumplings  i generally just opt for the pork ones  with real crabmeat soup dumplings (not here)  you'll get a very nice savory crabmeat flavor  all in all though  the xlbs here are probably the best i've tasted in ny (although again  still not on the same level as din tai fung) don't fill up on just the xlbs though! there are plenty of other items here that are perhaps even more noteworthy  one of my favorites is the stir fried mustard green with pork rice cakes  relatively light compared to the other mixed meat seafood rice cake option  but i really love how the mustard green cuts right into the pork flavor  and who doesn't love chewy savory stir fried rice cakes?! the wontons here are also great  the wontons are nice and petite (as they should be! none of that wonton on steroids crap that a lot of chinese restaurants are serving up  bigger is not better  at least when it comes to wontons ) and served in a savory dried seaweed egg drop soup  the pan fried buns dumplings (sheng jian man tou) here are probably some of the better ones i've had in ny   a good choice if you're looking for a pan fried dumpling option  the xlbs still have a leg up on their pan fried cousins though  as the pan fried option could use a bit more soup in them  the various stir fried green veggies are all nicely done  a good complement to all the meat  and finally order a few of the flakey red bean pastries to end on a sweet note  flaky sesame tops with a very generous helping of red bean paste  yum service is generally rushed (expected given the crowds)  but respectful enough  have had shanghainese staff a couple of times  not sure who the owners are  but pretty safe to say not strictly shanghainese anymore  cash only 
food just ok  but service is terrible  waitress so rube  attitude so bad  no manner at all    come here just cause of food but some waitress are bad
my roommate and i stumbled across this place yesterday and we didn't have high expectations    we actually had no expectations at all  my roommate is an international student from china & she said that the food served here is just like in her homeland and it was delicious!
best soup dumplings around      pork and crab are my favorite !! a must try when in ny     place is always packed with locals  staff is nice and place never disappoints
it's still an iconic soup dumpling venue  the quality has  gone down a bit  perhaps  it's due to its significant popularity in downtown flushing  on the plus side  the extra traffic has forced renovation and expansion major hits are its soup dumplings  both pork and crab  they make great scallion pancakes  the shanghai pan fried noodles are freshly made menu is simple and short  but they know what they are doing 
i came here a second time  and the food was much better this time  however  the amount of time i had to wait was ridiculous  i ordered fried dumplings and a beef scallion pancake  and my friends not only got their orders  but finished eating before my food came the fried dumplings were good  but made me regret not getting steamed  the beef scallion pancake  which i had to wait another 15 minutes for after getting my fried dumplings very late  was a huge disappointment  the beef tasted dry and old  and the pancake part was mediocre i would come here again  but won't order fried dumplings anymore  and order the regular beefless scallion pancake next time 
one of the best siew lung baos in new york! i love their crab and pork one and  its got so much soup in them! i came here yesterday and ordered 3 orders i think i ate two orders myself  d love love love this place! alot of people like the cold appetizer    the spicy beef with tripe    i think its pretty good since i cant really eat spicy  definitely give this place a try!
the food is great and their xiao long bao is the best i've ever had  waiters hardly notice you  you have to call out to them every time but that's fine  food is really cheap and that's great because i'm usually on a budget  it's a really popular restaurant so food sometimes takes a while to come out  at least the waiters give you a heads up about that before you order 
their soup dumplings are no joke   i think one of the reviewers mentioned theirs a lot of soup in each dumpling and she wasn't lying   after 3 slurps  i thought the soup was all consumed but then i bit into the dumpling and there was some more   the dough has the right amount of thickness with the perfect al dente consistency   furthermore  i thought the meat had a cleaner less greasier taste than joe's shanghai   i really loved their dumplings also  ate the shredded chicken rice cakes which were delicious!  so good   the only dud was the dumplings with sticky rice inside   i thought it was too doughy with the dumpling case along with the rice   last but not least  service was quick and food was really cheap   waiting to go again before i move to chicago   if anything  the asian food will be some things i'll truly miss about living in new york 
came looking for some good xiao long bao and nan xiang dumpling house provided exactly that  soup had a nice flavor  pork was juicy  and dumpling skins had a perfect consistency where it was neither too thick or thin 
oh no! the oil has changed! there is now too much salt in the food  i can't believe it  but the best soup dumplings in flushing has lost its crown  i will now look for a new place  i agree with tony c   the quality of everything here has gone down  go to kung fu xiao long bao instead!
this place has the best xiao long bao's in new york in my opinion  the bao's comes out nice and hot  the soup and meat aren't cold like joe shanghai's and they don't load up their menu with msg  i also believe this place makes better xiao long bao's then din tai fung  many people tend to love din tai fung because of it's fame but in reality  their xiao long bao's  are small and overpriced  i went to the original din tai fung restaurant in taipei  taiwan and it was terrible  are they clean? yes  but everything else is horrendous  the din tai fung in taiwan mostly markets to mainland china  japanese  korean  and just about every tourist imaginable as for nan xiang dumpling house  they're on the right track  the quality of their food is great and the owner definitely has a passion in the restaurant business  they expanded their restaurant twice  it use to be a tiny hole in the wall  now they've expanded to the store to their left and right  the soup dumplings comes out piping hot so be careful when you bite into it  the steam and soup can certainly burn and leave a mark in your mouth  what's great abut nan xiang's  they also make a variety of other good foods  their scallion pancakes  fried pork chops  and even dry noodles and noodle soups are quite satisfying  if you do order their dry noodles and prefer less saltiness  don't hesitate to request for less sauce  the sauce could be a little heavy and salty at times verdict   i've been coming to nan xiang's since the day they opened and so far  they have never disappointed me  the only thing i highly suggest doing is to go early because they can get very busy during lunch hours 
this is dumpling is not nan xiang dumpling! the taste is so different! the real nan xiang dumpling taste way more better! if you come from shanghai  you will now feel so disappoint !! fake nan xiang dumpling!!!
good food for a great price  i live in a different part of queens making travel time about 30 minutes to get to flushing  worth the trip every time beef scallion pancake is greasy with great flavor  if you don't mind the grease  you'll like it spicy beef noodle soup is awesome  it's a huge bowl that i really didn't want to share with my fiancee  my face was in that bowl  of course  soup dumplings  probably one of the best i've had in the city  bring cash and this place tends to get slammed during peak hours  when that happens  i just order to go 
came in with my fiance after a mets game  it was a little crowded but we were able to be seated pretty quickly  we tried some of the different types of dumplings and a sort of ramen dish  i dont remember the names  everything was pretty good but i wasn't necessarily wowed with everything  i thought it was good but i would probably try our another new place than gp back again  cash only 
never too greasy always nice and easy!! it was a lot of fun to eat and if you don't go during their really busy hours  they really do accommodate to what you need  it's pretty busy most of the time  but they cater and remember you  i was going to grab take out for three of their small dishes; love their char siu so much    staple to go item is a char siu bao  i was with a friend on a very hot day and they were very nice about me staying inside  my friend ordered something else too  very good overall! the receipt always comes low at this place  and you leave very full  got dumplings in peanut sauce  and the egg and chive bao; also good ayy 
has anyone noticed a change here? 1  the msg level are off the charts! mind you  i understand the use of msg at restaurants but we were thirsty before we even left the restaurant!   and then throughout the rest of the day!2  the soup dumpling skins    something's different  it's thicker than it used to be3  this may have to do with #2  do the soup dumplings looks bigger? they used to fit in my spoon and now its spilling over  can someone verify what's happened here?
above average food but poor service i ordered fried bun with chives & egg and waited for almost half an hour  when i asked them they told me they were sold out 
their scallion pancakes with beef are probably the best i've ever had  also the pork buns are a must 
first and foremost   when you sit down  especially on a busy day  i advise you to order your soup dumplings right away  it may take awhile for them to get it to you  if you have a party of 6 or more during rush hours  good luck waiting  you'll be salivating for the next hour  go grab this man a bib i usually order the regular pork dumplings which is amazingly good  if you are a newbie  which is perfectly fine  you must eat the soup dumplings the right way  i'm sure there is a tutorial on youtube already on it  i've seen a few good soup dumplings exploded all over the table  once again  go grab this man a bib if you come here early morning  get some sweet soy milk with crispy dough  they are both synergistic with one another  kind of like the asian version of oreo and milk  i hope that's a good analogy  maybe?another recommendation is scallion pancake with sliced beef  even though it's listed as for breakfast  you should get it anytime of the day  it has a nice hoisin like sauce that is slabbed inside  sometimes i also go for the pork & salted cabbage noodle soup  shanghai pan fried udon  or the rice cake with shredded pork as my entree  last  check how many women are there in that little partition where they make the dumplings  it's amazing! on a busy day  there's like 6 of them  i see at least 1 of them can't do anything because she can barely move her arms 
walked by this place frequently  but never gone in to try it  went in one friday night around 6 30 and there was no line yet  but by the time we were seated there was a wait forming  we ordered the scallion pancake with beef  steamed vegetable dumplings  pork soup dumplings  and the beef noodle soup (spicy)  this was more than enough for 2 people even though portion sizes were more appetizer like  the soup was a good portion  however  my favorite of the items ordered was the scallion pancakes  the sauce that comes on it is sweet and completes the whole dish  the food came out quickly as well which was great since we were starving everything on the menu is delicious and you probably can't go wrong  the prices are great as well and well worth the meal  will definitely come back soon 
this is where you find the ill xiao long bao  there is really nothing better than soup dumplings  for gods' sakes  they've combined soup and dumplings  automatically a win  and these are the best i've ever had  at nan xiang  the skin is delicate  you must gingerly place each dumpling in its corresponding spoon  lest you prematurely pierce the wrapper and waste even a drop of the luscious liquid inside  once bitten  the steam spills out of the dumpling  and you'll find yourself hard pressed to wait long enough to avoid burning your tongue on the incomparable  unctuous broth after you've slurped out the scalding soup  that last bite   consisting of pork filling and wrapper still saturated in the remaining juice and just a bit of vinegar sauce you scooped inside for punch    that is the bite that dreams are made of  that is a bite worth fighting for  hell  that is a bite worth braving the 7 train for  a bite that beats all other bites  and shockingly enough  the service is almost pleasant and the restaurant is almost clean  if flushing was closer  i'd eat here weekly  at a minimum 
super yummy  waited less than 5 minutes for a table for 3 on a thursday afternoon  server was so unfriendly as to be comical (no drink refills or replenished napkins) but we loved the food  best thing was the scallion pancakes with beef  xlb was delightful as were the udon noodles but we could have lived without the garlic cucumbers  glad to have made the trip 
the chinese server we had today had such bad attitude while serving the table  we understood that some dishes were sold out  however she didn't feel sorry for this at all  as a customer  i don't need my server to be offensive to me or my guests who were with me at that moment  my rationale of not giving tips makes sense to me and my guests  but the waitress didn't understand  she chased me down to the entrance and kept saying  "tips should be given separately"  of course  she's right  but she didn't deserve it! i strongly suggest people not go there unless service is not a big deal or you would pay for what you got 
i finally made it here! when i say i've been dreaming of soup dumplings for the past few weeks (especially in this crap freezing weather)  i've been dreaming of dumplings  (that should be the name of a tv show or something  ) anyway! totally  worth  the  hype! best soup dumplings i've ever had in nyc came with 2 other friends and zero wait for a table (possibly due to said freezing weather) and we had the scallion pancake (a+)  shanghai udon noodles (a++) and finally 2 orders of pork xlb (a++++++++)! we could've eaten another 2 orders but decided to stop and head over to new world mall's food court to keep our gastronomic adventures going  ) will definitely be back!
by far the best place to get xiao long bao in the entire city! nice atmosphere  great place to go with a group of friends or on a date  if you're willing to go out to flushing  definitely come here!
my small group came here and re defined the word brunch to mean "two meals  breakfast  followed immediately by lunch "  i don't have the mental wherewithal to condense my experience here into anything resembling a review  but i can just list what we had  so  here you go breakfast   salted soy milk     crispy dough   the former is a bowl of warm soy milk broth with some crispy dough soaking in it   the latter is basically a big cruller  but not sweet   you wouldn't eat the crispy dough by itself  it's too plain  but together with the soy milk it was all delicious lunch    appetizers   sides   spicy bamboo shoots  fried bean gluten  cucumber and garlic  soy peas (edamame)  cabbage  & shredded bean curdall of these were lovely  and also all were utterly skippable  because they took up space in our stomachs that could've been filled by dumplings   which brings me to lunch    entree ish stuff    soup dumplings  aka  the reason you are here   i have no points of comparison (i've only been to the joe's shanghai in midtown  and only once at that)  so i can't speak to whether these soup dumplings really are the best  or merely the second best  or whether their skins are thinner or thicker or just like they make them in shanghai or whatever   all i know is these dumplings were delicious  and you should have many of them   you're in a chinatown  but it's the perfect time to act like an american and stuff your face    pan fried pork buns   delicious!  i liked these as much as the soup dumplings   beef scallion pancake   doughy and sweet  i liked this but it was a bit heavy compared to the other food we had   be careful not to eat too much of this  lest you fill up and leave yourself no room for dumplings   spicy pepper beef noodle soup   a bit disappointing  mostly because wasn't spicy at all   the noodles reminded me of ramen  but when i mentioned this to one of my tablemates  i got a look of pity and derision  like i couldn't tell my noodles from the pot in which they were cooked   pan fried beef noodles   tasty   crispy on the bottom   but why get this when you can get more dumplings?lunch    dessert   sweet bean curd   your typical slippery gooey soft tofu  lightly sweet  i believe the specific question i asked my friends was  "why is this is my mouth?"    red bean puffs   delicious!  small  flaky  sweet  served hot miscellany   service is good but perfunctory   we had to keep flagging the staff down for tea refills  and one thing we ordered never came but was charged for     we arrived a little before 11am on a sunday and it was getting filled up   we got a spot right away but within ~15 minutes  there was a wait at the door   it's a popular spot   cash only 
wow! sooo juicy!!! each plump dumpling is filled w  soup! i ordered the juicy pork dumplings and the crab and pork dumplings  personally i think the crab and pork dumplings taste better than the regular ones  also had their sticky rice    thought it was just average  just come here for the dumplings  it's good!
my go to place for steamed juicy buns  the service isn't always great but the food is dependably good 
when we arrived there was about 10 people waiting outside    food must be good automatically clicks in  it takes about 20 min to get inside not bad for a sunday  the good thing was driving from long island and there is public parking lot across the street and a garage next door by the ktv club & its only $3 an hour we had 1 steamed vegetable dumplings 2 shanghai shao mai 3 shanghai pan fried u don 4 scallion pancake with sliced beef5  fried bun with chives & eggand of course free green tea and sweet soybean milk  ny melting pot at its best   give it a kicking try 
i enjoyed this place! its cheap and tasty! you and a friend can get two orders of dumpling and be stuffed for under 12 bucks  seating is quick  the service depends on the flow of people that day  but from what i saw they are used to the rush and handle it well  i was thankful to find this gem on a low budget day lol 
my go to soup dumpling spot in queens  cheap and open late  although parking is always a headache in flushing  this place is worth trying  order the soup dumplings (pork or crab) first as it takes awhile since they are handmade per order  the skin of the soup dumpling is just right  not too thick but thin enough to hold the meat soup  the juice that oozes out of the meat once the soup dumplings are steamed is the soup aka fatty goodness  how to eat a soup dumpling   poke a hole at the top of the soup dumpling and pour the soup that's in the dumpling into the big spoon provided  that way you can sip all the soup (aka meat fat) and eat your dumpling on the side  otherwise when you bite into the soup dumpling  the soup tends to spill all over the plate and you're left with just meat and skin  what's the point of eating soup dumplings if you aren't gonna enjoy the soup?? might as well go eat regular dumplings then 
l think it's best to tell you all now  this was my first time trying dim sum    it was amazing! i had to drive all the way out here to find the lego city starter set for my god son and so i decided to try out the soup dumplings that everyone was talking about i ordered dumplings and a sweet soy milk  omg  it was so good  at first bite i wasn't sure what i was doing and then it happened  the savory goodness came pouring out and it was blissful  the dumplings were so flavorful and the milk was the best i will definitely come back and try out the other menu items fyi  the "soup dumplings" are under dim sum on the menu (i asked a nice couple sitting next to me  they were clearly regulars)
really good  best soup dumplings i've ever had  flushing has great food  better than chinatown if you ask me  this place is really good and authentic and open late too 
the go to place in flushing for xlb  whenever i crave xlb  i come to this joint  what they lack in diversity or originality  they make up for in qualitythe staples for me here are the regular xlb  the scallion pancakes and beef tripe  the regular xlb are fresh; they manage to make the broth tasteful but not heavy or overdose on the fat while making the gelatin the scallion pancakes with the beef is really crispy and light  and goes really well with the hoison sauce that accompanies the beef and if you want a little kick to your meal  definitely go for the beef tripe  which is a cold dish  it can counteract the steaminess of the xlbs  )
they have ground cassava leaves which is very typical for madagascar cuisine so we love shopping there  we always get a free pack of eggs everytime we go  they have a parking lot which is very practical 
good food  quick service  medium size menu with good number of choices  soup dumplings are the star and definitely worth trying but i recommend exploring the full menu as well  always busy so expect a wait  but turnover is fast  cash only update  service has declined significantly 
great spot for soup dumplings  also the garlic cucumber is tasty 
when you get soup dumplings in flushing  you usually think of 2 places  nan xiang or joe's shanghai   these titans command the crowds of both locals and tourists throughout the year   i feel like nan xiang is where locals started going to after joe's became too popular  crowded  and expensive   nan xiang certainly doesn't have a wall of celebrity photos nor the faux asian decor that joe's has   however  nan xiang is creeping up in popularity as well   what started as a single small room has since expanded into 3 interconnected dining rooms  furthermore  while food quality is comparable to joe's  the service here lags significantly   i think some of the best dishes to get here are the scallion pancakes  pork soup dumplings  and the chicken rice cakes   if it's your first time here i would recommend getting the crab and pork soup dumplings  but they really don't add enough crab meat to justify the higher price   overall  the dumplings come in 6  large portions and are quite filling  the broth is creamy and usually piping hot   2 orders of dumplings and an app are usually enough for 2 people   i would add a cold soy bean drink to top it all off!
most people refer to this place as the red awning which serves soup dumplings   in my opinion their soup dumplings are better than joe shanghai and their scallion pancake with beef slices are amazing as well   when friends come to visit flushing for the first time  i usually bring them here to pop their cherry 
cash only  typical flushing service but you come here for the food  not necessarily to be pampered  if you are new to shanghainese food  here are a few options that i definitely recommend  beef scallion pancake  steamed pork soup dumplings  fried bean gluten  the soup dumplings come 6 at a time; nibble a hole  drink the soup  and eat the whole thing  the scallion pancake is amazing and comes in 3 pieces  the fried bean gluten may not seem appetizing but trust me; its addicting  love this place  reminds me of shanghai 
their soup dumplings are always fresh and delicious! my friend and i came here for lunch and we were seated immediately at a table  it's definitely a popular spot for asians and non asians alike since it's known for their authentic soup dumplings  in addition to ordering their soup dumplings  we also got a side of crispy scallion pancake  sweet soy milk and 2 cruellers  the prices are pretty decent for the amount they give as well as the quality       the soup dumplings were just as good as joe's shanghai and the look of them were more neat  there's a soup dumpling place downstairs of the new world mall that i think tastes the same but it's just a different environment       my favorite was dipping the crueller into the sweet soy milk and eating it like that  we couldn't finish the scallion pancake so we took it to go  i would definitely come back just for the sweet homemade soy milk  reminded me of my childhood 
spicy bamboo shoots and garlic cucumber  are good for starters  crab & pork dumplings  no credit cards 
the xialongbao ("soupy pork dumplings") are consistently good as i believe (and hope) they are freshly made when you order  but other than that  nothing else is worth writing home about  i have had their stir fry dishes like chowfun and chowmien ("stir fry thick rice noodle" and "stir fry egg noodle")  my experience is that there's more msg and soy oyster sauce than necessary  this place is always packed  so if you are impatient  go for brunch around 10 30 am  they also have tradition chinese breakfast items like soy milk and tofu custard  both of which i recommend 
xiao long bao is a must try  it took me an hour from manhattan to get to this place and it was worthwhile!
there is a reason why this place is infamous for their xlb  there's always a short wait  but it's worth it  it's so so good  and the scallion pancake can't be missed  i always need to order more than 1 order of xlb it's that good!
solid chinese food for a quick snack or filling meal  my personal favorites are the scallion noodles and red bean pancakes  generally underrated here and overshadowed by the soup dumplings  the scallion noodles are close in kin to the scallion pancakes! however  beware   these deliciously oily noodles are not meant for the faint of heart  the red bean pancakes are also a great sweet treat on a cold day  but they don't always have it so be sure to ask!
been here a couple times with friends   this place is always compared to joes shanghai in terms of their soup dumplings and to me both places are equally good   the main difference is the rest of the menu   i find joes shanghai has a more extensive menu but this is good   the other thing that i love here is the scallion pancake with beef  it is out of this world   so make sure you get that   but if you are coming for the soup dumplings this place is the place to go 
i wish we had more time and a bigger appetite to try more items from the menu  however  it was all about the dumplings the morning we visited nan xiang  we ordered the pork and veg wontons in spicy sauce   these were hearty and delicious in a slightly peanut butter flavored sauce with enough heat for a slow burn that creeps up on you  we also ordered the pork soup dumplings and crab pork soup dumplings  my husband claims these were the best xlb he's ever tasted   i do agree the flavor of the broth was rich and yummy  but the skin is a little thicker than i prefer  making them more filling  of course  the upside to that is there being less risk of breaking the skin  regardless  we will definitely return next time we are in flushing!
ehhhhh i don't see the hype about this place  the prices are dirt cheap but you get what you pay for  i ordered the pan fried noodles  and xlb  everything was on the greasy side  i know chinese food is greasy but this was like drenched with grease!
ordered the pork buns  pork and crab meat buns  the pan fried dumplings and shui mai omg delicioussssss shui mai was probably the least good and it was still authentic and wonderful dumplings are nice and juicy the buns though  they are the showstopper amazing and delicious  its like biting into hot happiness this place is cheap as well  which is only an added bonusdefinitely recommend this place 
best soup dumpling spot in ny  sorry joe shanghai  shanghai cafe  & dumpling house   remember though  nothing fancy    its flushing  get the pork buns  scallion pancake & noodles with scallion sauce  you won't regret it opens early (8am) & closes late (great for post drunk meals)  cash only  thankfully  they opened up a second room for more seating because it gets super packed on the weekends 
i have made many trips to flushing from manhattan just to eat at this restaurant  and it has never disappointed me  warning  everything here is quite oily and heavy   even the deceptively 'lighter' noodle options  the xiao long bao here is pretty good  the flavors  meat  and soupiness of the xlb are quite similar to the xlb i eat back in taiwan  i personally like the soy milk and scallion oil noodles here  but maybe it's because i'm perfectly fine with how oily the noodles are service is what you'd expect at a busy noodle dumpling spot  and of course it's cash only 
i think their michelin review has given this place too many fans and out of town tourists   well    i am an of town tourist   i don't see this place as any more special than some of the other great dumpling places on the west coast don't get me wrong   i loved the food here   the skin on the dumplings were thin   the soup inside was hot   all good things you expect from these types of dumplings   there are not a lot of tables so if you have a big group expect to wait   i was alone so i had a shared table   the diner across from me had some noodles and spicy cold dishes that looked really good if i lived in flushing  this would probably be one of my regular dining hangouts 
this place can do no wrong  it is amazing  get the soup dumplings  and spicy noodles  you will not be disappointed  it is such a hole in the wall type of place  but the service is good and fast get some dumplings to go   they're still good the next day!
although the waiters waitresses are not as attentive and we had to go up a few times to get some bowls or ask for someone the food makes up for it  best soup dumplings i've ever had! even better than joes shanghai (one in chinatown)!the beef tripe appetizer dish is always amazing and everyone should try it 
one word  yum! the food here is the real deal  the soup dumplings (pork or crabmeat) are a must  once you get the hang of how to eat them properly  they're very enjoyable  we kept wanting more and more  also  try the rice cake dishes  i've had pork and the chicken rice cakes  i think the pork one was slightly better  but both were delicious let's talk about the scallion pancakes  greasy deliciousness! it was so good  even when we were stuffed  we kept eating these pancakes  we've also tried the fried dough  i'm personally not used to eating plain fried dough with no topping  it was still good  one thing straight   the service here is terrible  the waitresses are very rushed  they throw your food on your table  if you're with a large group  they reach over your table so much that  if their hair was down  it would be in your tea  they don't come around to refill your water or tea unless asked  they're impossible to track down because they're running all over the place  however  they're forgiven because the food here is that good  the prices can't be beat   so cheap  we had a group of 6 hungry people    we all ate a ton of food and had food left over to take home    all for $67  don't come here around lunch (12 3) on a weekend  it will be packed  also  cash only and street parking is really hard to find  we paid $8 to park in the garage a few doors down 
5 star for food without considering the service   the shanghai dumplings have nice juicy fillings with plenty of soup   scallion pancake is crispy with plenty layers and flavor  rice cake dish is peppery but good pickled greens and julienned pork slices 
pork fried dumpling was good  dumpling was just a little larger than i prefer soup dumplings were good  but i know a better tasting dumpling in chinatown in manhattan  they needed twenty minutes to prepare my dumplings and they do not accept credit cards 
when my wife and i go to flushing this is one of our go to places   they serve authentic shanghai style food   the food is not too salty or to greasy like other places can be   the noodles are great   the xiaolong bao are great   my favorite thing on the menu is the beef roll  we have eaten here for breakfast  lunch and dinner   the food is always great   highly recommended 
the soup dumpplings here are actually really good compared to the ones at joe's shanghai  i asked my brother's friend if it was as good as this place in boston  he said it was better to which i opened up y stomach to a hellsing of these rapidly aggregating flavors  i am a han hyo joo fan  so  han hyo joo fans  come and eat here for some of the most delicious dumplings of your lives 
i really want to give this place a 3 5  but i'll round up  first off  this place is not a great place to bring a group  i came with 5 friends and we were lucky to get a table together  the food here is delicious  their soup dumplings are on point  they also had these steamed pork juice buns that were also amazing  i really loved it  the service here was so so  i guess i could have expected that at a chinese restaurant in flushing though  they never came to refill our tea or waters  and seemed pretty miffed whenever we asked them to refill it for us  they also gave us the bill for the table next to us  and we were all pretty confused about that  nor were they able to keep track of how many orders of soup dumplings we ordered (11  so i guess that's a high number  but still it's not our job to keep track for them)  another issue i have here is that many people think that the dumplings are cheaper here than other places  but really the orders are smaller than other places as well  they only give 6 dumplings per order compared to other places like joe shanghai's who give 8  i also don't think that these dumplings are so much better than joe shanghai's  i think they are very much on the same level  matter of opinion though  all in all  the food is good  the service is bad but it's a trade off  my group ended up spending about $20 person  but we love to pig out when it comes to soup dumplings  if we ordered individual dishes  it probably would have came out to much less 
2 orders pork nan xiang long bao  beef pan fried noodles and scallion pancakesthat's all i need  that's all i want  best soup dumplings this side of the world  the dumpling skin are thin yet strong enough to hold the filling and hot soup inside  once you taste the soup  you will definitely get addicted  i used to come to this place at least twice a week for almost six months until i realized how much i gained from eating all those dumplings  now i limit myself to once or twice a month i recommend this place if you are sick of ordering general tso's chicken from your takeout place but still want chinese food  or even if you aren't sick of general tso's chicken and just want some good food 
two stars  two words  msg poisoning  we ordered the beef scallion pancake  soy bean tofu salad  and one each of the pork and crab xiao long bao  the pancake was delicious and crispy  the xiao long bao were average  hot at least  tasted as expected but nothing mind blowing  salad was fine but the real adventure began about 15 minutes after we left  stomach aches  racing pulses and mild panic ensued as we frantically googled what might be happening   and the first result was "msg reaction " since physical illness is probably not a fair trade for average to good food  we probably won't be back 
i used to love this place   especially back in april when i last visited here (i don't reside in ny because i moved)   back then  the service was friendly and attentive and the food was hot and fresh tonight i was disgusted and embarrassed with the place   i had brought a friend  mom and sister out to eat to my once favorite establishment   here is what went wrong   after ten mins of sitting down  we were ready to order   no one checked on us  so my mom tried calling over a waiter multiple of times  but he was too busy   then when the waiter saw my mom asking for him  he walked past her!  and oh boy  was she frustrated!     when we finally ordered  all three of us gave the menu to the waiter  but the fourth person who was my friend didn't even order and he walked away from her with the menu still in her hands!  the hell?!  then we waved down another waiter  so she can order her food   when the food came  the shanghai fried noodles were still hard and there were no sauces for the dumplings   we had to ask for the ginger sauce and prep it ourselves   the service was just horrendous and it was so disrespectful that they would do that to my family and friend     i will never return to this restaurant   i hate it   what did we do to get disrespected like that?  earlier today  this was my favorite establishment   i came home to nyc recently and i couldn't wait to be back here eating their delicious food that i once dreamed of and after tonight  this establishment turned into a nightmare     i hope the staff reads my review and i hope they change their attitude for the better and put more love into the food     either way  i wish everyone a merry christmas  happy holidays and a happy new year!
i will provide an update once i go again  this review is based on my previous experiences  i still remember the first time i dined here  the quality was unmatched at the time  since the first time i went  i think they have expanded the restaurant to accommodate their continuing success  i think joe's shanghai was really popular and got a lot of attention from the press media at the time and got too lax complacent and that led to their plummeting quality  i feel like nan xiang dumping house is in danger of going through the same thing if they're not careful food  the crab soup dumpling is the way to go  the pork is good too but you just have to go with the crab (my preference)  my advice  as soon as you are seated (even before requesting water or tea)  just order 1 pork and 1 crab soup dumpling (for those that haven't tried it yet) right away to save yourself a little wait time  it usually takes anywhere from 15 to 25 minutes depending on how busy they are  to my knowledge it is always freshly made  it is highly recommended to eat the soup dumplings while it is hot  you can let it rest and cool off till you can tolerate the temperature but be careful not to let it cool down too much or else the skin becomes really tough  you can decide the other appetizers and entrees later because those takes considerably less time to prepare cook the appetizers i've had in the past was the scallion pancake with beef    spicy bamboo shoots  cucumber salad dish  and my favorite spicy beef & tripe (must try even for people who don't do well with spicy) obviously everyone comes here to try their soup dumplings  but they have a variety of other cuisine to try  i've had their rice cake with shredded pork in the past  i tried the pan fried seafood noodles and stacks up pretty well to other restaurants that are well known for them  i often see people try their noodle soup dish  so one visit  i tried it and it is very flavorful (a bit on the saltier side for my taste)  you can also try their soy milk drink (never tried it  but i see a lot of people drink it so it must be good)  final thoughts  writing about this brought a lot of nostalgia back and i will definitely visit soon  i pray that they don't suffer the same fate as joe's shanghai and got complacent and cocky now that they've tasted success 
delicious  authentic food on the cheap  doesn't get any better than this 
nan xiang was fine  i actually think i might like joe's shanghai better  but i was sick so my taste buds might have been off when i came here  i literally was nauseous and once i sat  i drank so much tea and was very faint that everything just tasted sort of bland to me  the soup in the dumplings were good though  i could definitely taste that  but the meat didn't seem to have any flavor  i think the beef scallion pancake was good too  but it was a blur to me and i only took a few bites  must go again to do a better review  but for now  4 stars 
im going to give this place (3) stars  the soup dumplings were good but i've had better  the shanghai pad fried udon was a little salty and needed some more seafood  the pork chop noodle soup was bland  the pork chop itself was very oily  also the waiter forgot to bring one of the items i ordered  but did not forget to try and charge me for it      smh  i would give this restaurant another try but not anytime soon 
super tasty  but a bit lacking in presentation  however  you do get what you pay for in this world  it's cheap eats  pancakes were my favorite item on the menu   and we ate a lot!!!
nan xiang sets the standard for all new york city soup dumplings  i waltzed in here starving after a yelp event at queens theater  so in tow  she is not as passionate about dumplings as i am (and is more fit for it)  but she humored me and was rewarded for her efforts the "steamed buns" aka soup dumplings (regardless of which xiao long bao you get) are outstanding  with generously apportioned filling  great texture  and a hot  fatty  oily broth that will take you to starch heaven  the pan fried dumplings were also top notch  and the scallion pancake with beef was decadent  as would be expected service was fine but we were there relatively late (10 pm)  so maybe it falters during rush hours  if you're a dumpling man or woman  you must come here at least once  period 
we love this place  the food is always great  we get the soup dumplings (duh) and rice cakes  we also enjoy the scallion pancakes  bean curd and the tripe  if it was just the food i would give it 5 stars but the service isn't the best  definitely come try it out 
this place is a "must" if anyone is ever interested in cheap yet delicious chinese food   this small restaurant is constantly filled with people ready to dive in to authentic "xiao long bao" and their other signature dishes like scallion pancakes with beef  beef noodles  drunk chicken and much more   normally  many people wouldn't associate chinese food as "comfort food " however  this place will definitely shed a new light on this misconception   one flaw would be that the service is just average and if you go during a crowded time  you may have to wait anywhere from 15 30 minutes 
words cannot simply define how fine this cuisine is  for every dumpling i had explode in my mouth  it impacted me with flavors i could never expect or even imagine  especially before from the land of amish and corn; also known as ohio  as i've had good food in ohio  the quality of what this place had is on a tier that i could never imagine most places in the world having  for anyone reading this  i truly reccomend giving this place a try  adding on  i also had the beef scallion pancake and let me tell you  that    divine creation was like biting into the soul of food itself  how powerful that flavor was  was beyond any expectation or any words i could use to describe how amazing these were to have with the dumplings  i highly thank the amazing staff and i can't wait to come back! this is truly one of my favorite places in the usa to dine at  and yes  i mean all of the usa  i've had many foods yet have only got to review so much  but i can truly say i'm thankful for getting to write this review  see this place again soon i hope!
this place is legit yes  the soup dumplings are amazing  the soup is rich with loads of ginger  which i love   these are probably the soupiest dumplings i've had so far   the skins are a little thicker  but how else are they going to get all that soup to stay inside?  i went for the soup dumplings but i'm probably going to dream about those crispy noodles    those greasy fried brown gravy doused noodles were amazing  i liked it because the sauce was rich and flavorful without being excessively salty   i thought to myself  wow  what is that richness in the sauce  and then realized this mysterious flavor could be attributed to the pools of oil that formed at the bottom of the dish   meh   don't eat it everyday or you'll be another number for the obesity stat in the us but have it sometimes     and dreaming is calorie free   right?
to describe xiang xiao long bao to a newbie  my son said they are little balls of heaven   near paper thin steamed dumplings  stuffed with pork or seafood and a broth that is one of the most amazing things you will ever eat   the art of consuming these "little balls of heaven" is printed on the walls   it can be dangerous  the broth is super hot   our method is to very gently pick one out of the bamboo steamer  place it on a spoon  carefully nibble a corner of the dumpling   add a little chili paste  slurp the broth and finally eat the dumpling   heavennans is the best place to get xiang xiao long bao in flushing   joes makes great ones  but nans are the best they do have other items on the menu  but other than a real good scallion pancake and a rice cake and pork dish that is incredible  we have never tried anything else   there is no reason to   if we want xiang xiao long bao  this is always are first choice   it is always busy  but they keep expanding the place so the wait doesn't ever seem that long   trust me on this one folks   it is worth the wait 
the little crab dumplings  buns were excellentthe pork dumpling were pretty good but not hot enoughyear cake was decent beef noodle soup was disappointing and not hot c'mon this is a chinese establishment !! food has to be piping hot or we all know it's not fresh !!
i love this place! tried joe's but it just can't hold up to the soup dumplings from here  the wait for the dumplings can get pretty long and it's cash only  but well worth the wait!
i love the food here  i usually get the soup dumplings and the shanghai panfried udon  however  those are the only good quality about this place  5 5 for foodfor service  it's absolutely horrendous  as i'm writing this there are 3 waiters standing and socializing with each other  although there are a ton of empty tables when we walked in  it literally took 5 7 minutes for us to get seated (party of 2)  there's a lady that sits in the front that does almost nothing  usually she's talking on the phone or playing with the cash register  every time i go here  even if they have nothing else to do  the waiters will not fill up your tea or come to you unless you call them over  even then they will pretend to not notice you sometimes  they've made direct eye contact with me and still proceeded to ignore me  for 3 of my visits  they forgot some part of my order    and i only ordered a total of 3 dishes     1 5 for servicethat being said  i come here at least 3 times a month for dinner  this has been the case for the last 2 years  literally each visit  the service has been consistently shitty   definitely come here for the food but make sure to have good company or something to do because you'll spend most of your time waiting 
the food was delicious  but the wait is very long and the wait staff was not very polite to me  the table next to me came in 10 minutes after me  but they got their food long before me (the same items) and the staff acted annoyed that i asked  but if you want delicious authentic food (their soup dumplings are amazing) and you don't mind a wait  then check it out 
known for the delicious xiao long baos  both by the locals and the tourists  chinese and non chinese  i come here just for that  literally  my bf and i get 4 orders of the pork xlbs  and that's it  i've tried the usual side dishes (scallion pancakes  stir fry shanghai noodles  shanghai noodles with pork chop  bean curd tofu "cow fu"  and cold fish)  it's average and definitely not as good as joe shanghai's dishes  plus the headache of parking near there (unless skyviewing it up  3 hours for free parking at sky view)  and the long wait   just doesn't make it worth going for  the xlb is probably the best in flushing but the others at joe shanghai or shanghai cuisine 33 aren't much far behind  additionally  i don't find getting the crab xlb worth the upcharge  service is also not great get in  xlb it up  get out 
not impressed  xlb dumplings were just ok  had some stir fried rice cakes  uninspiring and lacking flavor  also had the scallion pancakes with beef  was pretty good  the best part of the meal was the garlic cucumber  if you come here its a must try  very simple but delicious 
seriously  if you find better dumplings than at nan xiang dumpling house anywhere on earth  i will give you $1 the food here is so delicious and so plentiful that you might be beside yourself while you're eating and then find yourself mourning a little when your plates are cleared  lamenting that humans don't have the bovine trait of four stomachs in which to stuff just a few more dumplings especially good are the pork soup buns and the shrimp soup buns  to die for there are a good deal of vegetarian options  so the members of our dining party who did not eat meat actually had plenty to choose from  if you're really strict about your vegetarianism  i would certainly double check my only lament is that this place isn't closer to home!
it's always better to save best for last so i'll start with the cons atmosphere is not the best  kind of ugly! and the scallion pancakes were a little greasy  that's it!today was my first time ever trying soupy dumplings  so good  my lips were a little burnt at the end of the experience  but they were soooo delicious i couldn't even complain  our table got two  orders of soupy dumplings  one of fried pork dumplings  one veggie and two scallion pancakes with pork  the veggie dumplings were a little dry and too healthy tasting  but everything else was amazing  not too salty or greasy and warm and filling for the ideal winter comfort meal  we ate family style and were able to try a bunch of different things  for 14 bucks each we got to share 6 dishes between us  thank you  asia!
the food is delicious and cheap  it's a really nice place to eat with friends and share xiao long bao  i went several times there and was never disappointed 
small hole in the wall with pretty good food   very friendly service 
dumplings  good   scallion pancakes  good   scallion pancakes wrapped around beef  awesome   i'm not going to argue that this place has the xiao long bao in queens  because that would start an argument with joe's fans and any other restaurants   personally  i liked the other dishes on the menu  not only the soup dumplings   cheap eats that keep both the wallet and the belly full   that's all that matters 
always a solid choice for soup dumplings  and nowadays is also a popular spot for foodies   so you might end up waiting a while for a seat  be warned! now keep in mind this place has relatively similar prices to joe's (and better service too   )  so it's a no brainer which one is the better choice ah  the food! you can't go wrong with the cold & spicy beef and tripe dish here  or the aforementioned beef and scallion pancakes  if you are here for breakfast brunch  get the chinese doughnuts (they're basically long  fried  doughy sticks of goodness) and dip them in soy milk (cold hot salted)  all good eats here amigos!
the best soup dumplungs in ny hands down!
i was surprised there was even a 15 minute wait for a snowy day at 2 30 pm  but then again it was a weekend and nan xiang is super famous now (for good reason!)  by 3  it seemed like there were seats immediately available for walk ins  it's quite amazing that they can fill up all three dining areas and still have considerable waits but that's probably because they have the best soup dumplings (xiao long bao) i've had outside of shanghai  and i like to try soup dumplings everywhere! they were piping hot  so you definitely have to bite a hole in these and suck out the copious amounts of soup they somehow fit into these little guys  from the outside  you can see the shadow of the soup filling up about half the dumpling's height  it's hard to get tired of them prices are very reasonable  and it's extremely easy to underestimate how much you're ordering  so aim for $8 10 per person  (remember to bring cash!) it's also good to order from different parts of the menu  or else you might get impatient for your soup dumplings and fried dumplings  the fried dumplings (guo tie) were slightly disappointing given how great the soup dumplings were  the wonton soup was pretty good  and they even put little shrimps inside  i wasn't looking forward to the vegetable dumplings  but they were surprisingly quite tasty  i can't say nan xiang has the most flavorful dim sum overall  but they used noticeably less oil than many other places i went to and if you're looking for good service  don't come to a chinese restaurant  i was just looking for competence  and i got it  don't be afraid to wave down the servers though since they don't come around very often!
go for the warm soybean milk and and the soup dumplings! the wait is not too bad  good number system  cash only  go go go go!
food was very good  however i have had similar food in the area that was better   the decor needs to be updated   staff could learn to be a bit more friendly   this place was able to accommodate a large group 
loooove edamame  tofu & cabbage appetizer here  of course i like xiao long bao 
the only place where i get soup dumplings  joe's shanghai is too oily and pricey for me  i don't really eat the noodle dishes here (for the reasons of being oilier than i prefer) but you must get   any of the soup dumplings  i prefer the pork! the meat is always so soft and fresh   the pork and cabbage soup  i almost get this all the time along with the pork dumplings  it's a very simple bowl but i love the bite in the noodles and the clear broth   fried bean gluten  i'm chinese and still don't know what this is exactly made of but it's delish  and loaded with calories like others mentioned  they have expanded  i totally almost went to the restaurant next door because i wasn't used to it!
i've been ordering takeout for a while from here and only recently got to experience their service  to be honest  just from the general vibe i got from some of the staff staff workers here  i figured the service wouldn't be great and it lived up to my expectations for better or worse   my friend and i got an appetizer to go with our orders and the food took about as long as i expected it to  however  we figured that our appetizer was going to be lost considering how long we were waiting and we were right  the damn thing never showed up and to add insult to injury they still had the nerve to leave it on the check  cleared that up without any fuss though still  some of the kitchen staff were on lunch break and they even had the appetizer we ordered at their table   "i guess we know where that went "
this was my first meal in flushing  ny and it was quite the experience  service was quick  i was immediately seated and handed a menu  then offered tea  but when i said no thank you the waitress looked puzzled and said "tea?" i repeated my self with a kind voice but then she answered even more confused "tea??" so i had tea  and recommend you agree to the tea as well  as she poured i asked "what kind is if?" she said with a smile "i'm not sure " the young waitress then asked what i would like  i wanted a minute to look over the menu since its in a different language with choppy translated english  a minute later she came back and i kept my head down to show that i wasn't ready  she reached over and flipped the menu over  pictures!  she smiled again  i pointed to what everyone raves about the pork dumplings  five minutes later a man placed and opened a wooden steaming round box bowl across from me and said "steam pork buns " i stared at the swollen sticky sacks  the tongs placed next to them  and the chop sticks at my right  i didn't know how to eat my foreign meal as they cooled down  i sipped on the mystery tea  i watched the other people in the restaurant  a young lady closest to me was talking in the phone and eating at the same time  it looked like she was eating a type of dumpling and using the utensils she was careful not to touch the food with her hands  every other group seemed to know what they were doing and ate the same way  soup spoons and chop sticks i watched and learned  i picked em up with the tongs and ate the dumplings with the soup spoons oh man! the dough of the dumpling is gooey and plain  then bam! the juice broth is incredibly tasty  full of flavor and the ball of pork inside is pretty yummy  the juice was the best part  halfway through the 6 dumplings that come in one serving  i was getting full  the dumplings are hearty  i only ordered this one dish and when i finished i was surprised i learn that they take cash only  thank god i had some on me  fast service  pictures make it easy to order  my food was great  learn how to eat your dish  and have cash 
this is the taste of home to me  everything's pretty good  the only less start is the pan fried bun is still not as authentic as shanghai  avoid weekend for sure  wait way too long and can't even find parking in flushing 
this place is good but not that good   pros  soup dumplings are good they have soybean soup drink and breakfast options just like in taiwan!  quick service gives you tea when you sit down relatively cheap cons  busy place (will be about a 15 20min wait during peak hours for a small group) takes 45+ min to get to from les i give four stars for the food quality (although i'd like to note that they received a b for food sanitation!) but 2 3 stars in terms of coming back  i think there are just as good restaurants in chinatown
my biggest grip about this place is that it's cash only  other than that  there honestly wasn't too much of a flavor difference between the reg pork soup dumplings or pork+crab soup dumplings  (in my opinion  joe's shanghai has a better crab soup dumpling with stronger crab flavor )my party of 4 was seated quickly after arrival in one of the side rooms  we all enjoyed the complimentary hot tea  we weren't too hungry so we ordered the pork soup dumplings  pork+crab soup dumplings  scallion pancakes with beef  and scallion dumplings to share between all of us  definitely authentic  final bill? $30 including tip  can't beat that price!
as i scrolled down to read the reviews for this place  i notice that there were a (i wouldn't say huge but a noticeable) gap between the ratings  i think it's safe to say that the reason why majority of the reviews rated 5 stars are all tourists  i've dined here long before it has become a "hot spot" for tourists  i can also tell you that their quality in food has also dropped remarkably because they are overly confident that customers will still come and dine because they are "recommended by michelin guide" or referred by friends  be aware that this place only accepts cash!!!i came here recently with my family and friends for dinner and were told to wait because our table was being set up  while we stood near the hostess stand and chatted  we noticed that we waited about ten mins for our table  normally it would have taken at least 5 mins to seat us so my aunt had asked the hostess how much longer we should wait  the hostess  while looking down on her phone and texting someone responded nonchalantly  "oh the waiter already called you guys already like a couple of times"  of course my aunt retorted  "why didn't you say something to us then " the hostess without looking up  just shrugged and repeated  "he called you guys a couple of times " so we had to wait an additional 5 mins before we were seated  when the food came  our stir fried noodles were salty; we returned it and asked to replace it with a less salty one  the flat rice noodles with shredded beef was also on the salty side but it was manageable and i could still stomach it  the steam pork dumpling soup was bland and the scallion pancake with beef was extremely oily  seriously  i was here a day ago for lunch and it was definitely less salty and less oily than this  i think we had a bad chief that night  if you're looking for a cheap place to eat  welcoming terrible service and wanting to be greeted by a rude ass hostess  this is the place for you  we left the place within half an hour and my sister and i made sure the hostess receive the same gratitude that she has shown us by saying  thanks for nothing bitch before we left the restaurant 
awww  hands down  some of the best soup dumplings  soup meat filling is flavorful  wrapped in a chewy  delectable dough  pancake scallion here is delicious  not too greasy  and the rice cake stir fry is amazing there are a fair amount of tables inside  so although there is often a line  the wait really isn't too bad  service here is efficient; the food comes out very quickly and soon your belly will be full 
dare i say that this is the best soup dumpling place in flushing? why yes  yes i do prior to discovering nan xiang many years ago  i was slowly getting more annoyed joe's shanghai being a popular tourist stop (read  insanely long wait times and diminishing quality of their soup dumplings)  so when someone mentioned a new place that opened up on prince street  i checked it out and immediately fell in love  the soup dumplings here come six per order and are a good size  and the soup within is not too greasy  (i've seen soup dumplings with grease lumps in the soup   not very appetizing to see or eat ) they've also evolved from providing a small dish of black vinegar for the soup dumplings to now having a small spouted container of black vinegar at every table to pour however much you want  the rest of the menu mainly contains appetizers and rice noodle dishes  but everything i've tried so far is delicious  my favorite noodle dish is their fish fillet and pickled mustard noodle soup when it first opened  it was a small restaurant with just 6 8 tables  now  it has taken over space on either side of the original section and has about 30 tables  even with the expansion  come during weekend dinner hours and you may have to wait a few minutes for a table  but the food is definitely worth the wait  as a tip  place your soup dumpling order as soon as you are shown to your table so it will come out faster while you decide on your other entrees happy slurping  everyone!
this is on my frequent list  i like to stop in for a few dumplings ever so often  the prices are unbeatable and the food is always consistently good  definitely try the scallion pancakes and the soup dumplings  the fried udon is also great we ate for about 4 people and the bill was only about $45 with alcohol  cant beat that!!
the xiao long pao is very juicy the food is good only the service is too slow we wait about more than 10 mins to check out have no idea where the waiter is food is excellent recommend here!
this location has wonderful chinese dumplings and other chinese foods  the only problem that i have with this shop is that it is always busy so sometimes orders would take 20 minutes which in my mind is a bit long for the second dish to be coming (some dishes are cold or easier to whip up) 
the scallion pancake with meat & soup dumplings are really good and affordable  went here cause it had good reviews and it did not disappoint
wow  the steamed pork buns are out of this world good  we also had the basic udon but it was meh  service was fast  there was a line out the door but we only waited 10 minutes  keep in mind it's cash only! super cheap though so don't worry about having a ton of cash i can't stress enough how delicious the bao were  the best!
this was pretty good! surprisingly i have had a hard time finding great chinese food  but loved this one! and gosh it came so fast!
the highlight here are obviously the soup dumplings  which  some in both shrimp and pork variety and come packed in a flavorful broth  combine with the ginger soy mix for an enhanced flavor! the environment is a bit hectic and i've had instances where certain utensils weren't cleaned properly but  aside from that   a pleasant experience 
lived in china for several years and in several places  this place is the bomb  authentic dishes  awesome flavors  and no nonsense service  i'd go here weekly if i lived in flushing the cold dishes are really special and fresh here along with the dumplings 
this place redefines chinese american cuisine to me  great food  low prices  noisy neighborhood  i love it 
i was pleasantly informed that they close at midnight as opposed to the advertised 11 30 closing  i arrive and was seated immediately  to start we ordered a cold appetizer; the spicy beef tendon  it was a well seasoned and spicy beef and tripe dish that kept me satisfied along with my tsingtao beer till my pork and crab soup buns arrived  roughly 10 minutes passed and our freshly hand made soup dumplings arrived  per usual  the piping hot dumplings tested my technical soup dumpling technique  one must consume the dumpling without wasting the soup and the skill comes in doing so without scorching one's tongue  i nibble off a bit of the tender soup bun to allow the golden soup and the pork crab filling to cool enough so i could consume the dumpling with a swift bite  i can't say that other soup dumplings are not on par  but this place is constantly clean and consistent with their buns  my go to spot when it comes to xiao long bao craving  the only slight con was that the place does not accept credit cards  cash only! so don't forget to bring your cash money when coming to indulge your soup bun needs!
arrived sunday at 1015am   place half full   got our seats and menus then waited  waited  waited for our waitress to notice us  talk to us  take an order   nope   maybe she had a bad night or a bad morning?  either way  who cares  you are the waitress in the room so i guess maybe ignoring us probably wasn't in your job description   the cuc and beef tripe salads arrive!  not bad   water ordered when we sat still not there and food is getting spicy   finally water but only after watching her get it  pick it up  put it down a few times   dumplings arrive   soup dumplings were fine  shumai looks blah   take a bite and it's not too hot so i pop it in my mouth   melted off the roof of my mouth   must have been microwaved  because that's the only way outside is sort of hot but inside is mushy molten  but that's impossible because you see the flurry of steamer basket activity on way in   ask for more water and now she is just messing with us   same water routine as before   she is just nasty mean or really had a bad night   who cares  i'm in pain   finally a check and out the door   yep  on way past the back room kitchen  there she is  taking small plate of dumplings out of the microwave   nice work reusing days old refrigerated product  you guys suck  decent place back in the day but good god things have changed   maybe that's why i hadn't been back to you in years   the neighborhood selection has improved but you are way past your prime   avoid it   go anywhere else   there are plenty of old school choices that hold up well but not you  try the food courts and sample some fresh made food 
i'm giving this place a 4 because recently it's becoming so difficult to get a seat inside the restaurant  there are people waiting outside for a possible hour to get inside  the soup dumplings here are great if it's your first time there  after continuous outings at this restaurant you realize that the soup dumplings are not the only thing that this shop has to offer  the crispy noodles and their vegetarian noodle soup are beyond delicious  don't be like me and just go there for their dumplings every time  the taste slowly gets boring  try something new from their menu  if your feeling adventurous try the spicy pork ears )
better than joe's shanghai hands down  just go  stop looking through the reviews  you will not regret it they don't have an extensive menu  so if you're there  your there for the soup dumplings  i've been to this restaurant over 20 times and i've never been disappointed  great food for a great price  i never spend more than $30 for a meal for two  you and your wallet will leave stuffed    well that is to say that you have more than $30 bucks to begin with 
needed some dumplings nearby & found this spot   veggie dumplings fresh but add pepper & soy sauce   my friend got the soy sauce noodles real good & soup dumplings tasty & also fresh   service was really nice which i'm surprised haha!  i just wish they had shrimp dumplings 
i really love nan xiang xlb  right off of flushing boulevard  where the chinese food is as authentic as it gets  nan xiang xlb (as its name suggests) has great xiao long baos *otherwise known as soup dumplings*  i got the soup dumplings with crab  shanghai nese shumai  a fried cruller  and a small cold appetizer of shredded potato sticks  the soup dumplings were amazing  they were so fresh and tender (there are aunties rolling out dough and filling dumplings right outside the kitchen)  the gelatin inside the soup didn't leave a residue but rather a very pleasant mouthfeel  the soup itself was seasoned properly  the crab didn't hinder but imparted another layer of flavor and the unmistakable shellfish  seafood umami  the shumai were good as well  they were filled with sticky rice and pork sausage  they were good with a touch of chili oil found as a condiment on the table  the fried cruller were light and crispy  the potato salad was light and tasty  i think the hidden neglected item on the menu is their soymilk  house made and served both hot  cold  the sweet drink is definitely a perfect accompaniment to the rich taste of the soup dumplings  this is a restaurant getting more and more coverage throughout the city  especially with vice  munchies doing an excerpt on the establishment  it is still a hidden gem  just now a little more exposed to the public  a place with great good  decent service and all at a very reasonable price 
this food was delicious  the dumplings are awesome  also order a scallion pancake  we also had crispy noodles with chicken  the best noodles i had in a long time  they give you green tea when you sit down   this place is great  service is pretty good too 
i think this place is a little overhyped up in flushing    went with a group of friends because i heard it was legit  the soup dumplings were pretty good but if have to say i like the shanghai cafe ones from manhattan chinatown better  i'm pretty sure they were cheaper too  the noodles and rice cake dishes were pretty good but not anything wildly special by any means  this place is packed so get there a bit in advance to hit up seats but would i go all the way to flushing just for this  place naw not really  id say the staff was just average at best yea  3 5 rounded up  not bad 
after seeing reviews comparing joe shanghai for the crab dumplings and scallion pancakes i knew i had to stop by to see what the buzz was about   the crab dumplings were good with more pork appearance then joe's but i'd have to say i like joe's a little better for the more crabby presence   the scallion pancakes on the other hand were significantly better here but prob behind little pepper scallion pancake due to the special garlicky dipping sauce they provide   the spicy beef and tripe was outstanding and the rice cakes with mustard greens were also a treat   we got the shanghai pan fried udon which was also not as good as joe's shanghai noodles which my kids love   overall a nice spot to check out but will probably stick to joe shanghai and little pepper which we visit routinely 
this place was way better before all the expansions and the prices went up and the food qualities went down the drain
solid dumplings  but every time i go we all leave saying  "wow that was good  but it definitely could be better "that sums it up  the dumplings are all nice and the other dishes are too  but nothing just blows you away 
i want to give it six stars  favorite dumpling house or breakfast place in flushing! they have all my favorite breakfast food when i had in china  xian dou jiang  cong you ban mian  etc  but be prepared to wait for a while when it gets busy  and cash only 
very good shsnghainese good  the xiao loong baos are very good but the crowds really deter me   they forgot one of my orders because the waiters are swamped  if u don't mind the long waits and cramped dining room then come here 
a co worker and i ordered take out tonight (3 16 15)   i've been meaning to try this place for a while but for whatever reason  tonight was my first time here   we sampled the pork and crab soup dumplings  rice cakes with beef and a beef scallion pancake   everything was good but the soup dumplings definitely stood out  and that alone is reason enough for a return trip   the scallion pancake was good but it was super greasy and the rice cake was a little light on the beef   the prices were reasonable and the service was fair   for a monday night it was pretty busy but maybe it's like that every night   i will surely return to order more soup dumplings and sample some other menu items 
come here at least twice a month because if you want soup dumplings at 10pm on a wednesday night  they are still open and the workers are making the soup dumplings as you order!the noodle soup is really good as well avoid coming here on weekends as you will be waiting outside for at least 30 mins or so just to get seated 
lots of people and probably need to wait everyday during lunch time  they will steam the soup dumpling after we order it and it takes time  so it's better to order soup dumpling right after you have sit or even order that when you wait for sit  i ordered soup dumpling  fried buns  hot soy milk and steam rice dumpling for two and they are all good!! their prices are reasonable too  good place for lunch!! i love the hot soy milk! want it again before i leave ny!! however  it's cash only!!*
craving some dumplings and pork buns  i ventured into nan xiang dumpling house (nxdh)  a restaurant with minimal decor   once in  you're approach by a waiter waitress  who provides you the menu and water in a cup  the service provided is not great   do not expect a welcoming approach  smile or good attitude from the servers  the menu list is not the most sizable relative to the surrounding asian style eateries (approximately  nxdh offers 66 options plus a handful of soda options)  i am highly disappointed in the lack of seltzer soda  however  nxdh makes up for it in price and quality of the food  in addition  their prices are on the low end  which is great who doesn't like economic pricing?         the pan fried pork buns have a solid  rich taste  the amount of bread to meat ratio is unequivocally greater of the former   their scallion pancake with slice beef is a must try on your first visit  moreover  the sauce has a strong  rich flavor  the insulating pancake has a subtle flavor  and soft texture   you will likely have this item every time you return  i tried their cold dish appetizer  the spicy beef and tripe  i highly enjoyed it the flavor is extremely savory  in an effort to not let leftover bun bread end up in the trash  i mixed the spicy beef and tripe into half of a pan fried pork bun's bread (baozi)  the bun complimented the savory meat taste greatly  in the end  a great idea!       i have returned and tried other options on the menu ever since my first visit  and everything else ordered thus far has not disappointed  some dishes have satiated the palate(spicy beef noodle soup comes to mind)  i highly recommend this place to all who enjoy chinese cuisine  a  j enjoy your meal 
i came here on a sunday afternoon to see that the line was out the door  regardless  we went in  got our number  and waited about 15 minutes before we were called i'd been craving a good taiwanese style breakfast for some time  so i knew exactly what i wanted when the waiter came  we got the scallion pancake  scallion pancake with sliced beef  pan fried udon  fried bun with chives and egg  and 2 orders of soup dumplings  the scallion pancake with sliced beef came out first and completely blew my mind  despite the greasiness  it was absolutely delicious  so now with my sky high expectations  the rest of our food followed  the skin of the soup dumpling  in my opinion  is superior to joe's shanghai  however  i wasn't as impressed with the filling  i'd give it a 3 5 out of 5  but it was still delicious overall  my main complaint is with the chive box  or jiu cai he zi  i absolutely love them  i almost always order them when i go to similar restaurants in jersey  i also make them when i'm at home and could eat 10 in a day  when it came out  i knew there was going to be a problem  for starters  it was fried to hell and back  picking it up without the filling falling out was virtually impossible because of the pool of oil it sat in for who knows how long  then when i took a bite     i almost spit it all out  it was essentially all chive  there was hardly any egg  and maybe one or two strands of mi fan  the chives were also coated with a thick layer of oil  it was inedible  if i wanted to eat 3 pounds of oily chives  i'd have picked them out of my own garden at home and not paid 4 bucks for it  i wish i never ordered it because it completely ruined brunch for me  i would come back  but shame on me if i order the chive bun again    
popped in again today after some shopping nearby    ordered the scallion pancakes with sliced beef and steamed pork buns (xiang long bao)    both were perfect for a mid day lunch along with the green tea  highly recommended   total for both came to $11 and change with tax   cash only   service is just ok and a bit aloof 
everything we ordered was delicious  the pan fried pork buns looked so good we ate them before i had a chance to take a picture  they were perfectly cooked and squishy balls of heavenly goodness the food arrived so fast  great service and yummy food  we will for sure come back 
this place is amazing! the soup dumpling compared tojoe shanghai is so much better  this one time i asked for a cup of ice and they said they had no ice which made no sense to me but that's whatever  the rice cake with shredded chicken is really good and the cold soy milk is also good! i should be checking in more often! the scallion pancake with beef is also delicious! i have no bad complaints about this place besides the whole ice situation 
the best soup dumpling experience i've have so far! i am not asian  so my knowledge is limited  but i'm certain any regular of this place would agree  highly recommend the scallion pancakes  crispy noodles with shredded chicken and shanghai pan fried udon noodles 
there is literally no services at this  restaurant  the breakfast is mediocre unless you are really in mood for dumpling   we were first order and last to be serve along with other customers  we end up cancel the two items that never came and leave with dignity  we are here to enjoy and appreciate the good food and not throw away the hard earn money 
we got the steamed pork soup dumplings (~$6 for order of 6)  scallion pancake without beef ($5)  and hot soy bean milk (~$1 50)  everything was rly good and rly cheap!! service was fast  highly recommend 
my absolute favorite meal in nyc! it was a close tie with nyona which  i gave five stars but  i just had to knock this place down to 4 stars solely because of cleanliness and service but  it is five stars is flavor  if there is one thing you get here  let it be the xiao long bao  that is clearly what everyone comes here for  gigantic  delicate  delicious  meaty and soupy dumplings  these little pockets of heaven are so good on a cold day  i've been to din tai fung and yes  everyone thinks they are the best and i would arguable say they are amazing but  between the two  i actually prefer nan xiang  sure  the dough is a little thicker and a little grainy but  so much soup!!!we also had the cold tofu dish which  was a great way to start the meal  it tasted like a mild kim chee flavor and the tofu had an interesting consistency  it was firmer than normal tofu and looked a bit like gluten actually  we loved it either way and it got our appetite going  the pan fried noodles were also a favorite and all of us fought over who would have the last bite  a lot of people mentioned the beef and green onion pancake here but  i didn't love it  the dough was a bit too thick and the pieces of beef were quite dry  i actually preferred the pancake on it's own  be forewarned to get everything we ordered but  the wontons in spicy oil  dear goodness this was awful  i can't even tell what was in this sauce other than spicy oil but  it separated from the oil and looked and tasted like peanut butter  the wontons were dry and looked plastic  it was just awful overall  great restaurant in flushing and definitely a memorable xiao long bao experience!
this is a great place! i really love the xiaolongbao here  really good food! will come here again 
very decent soup dumplings  very delicate and soft dumpling skin and a little more on the sweet side than salty like the famous joe's shanghai  they have other breakfast menu items like the salted soybean curd and fried crispy dough  they have a generous selection of chilled dishes you can pick in the front of the restaurant  always packed no matter what time you decide to go  if they could somehow figure out how extend their space to allow more seating that could help with the seating  the staff isn't always the happiest or courteous but i come here for the food so that never bothers me 
i never did a shanghai style dumpling house before  but i decided to take a chance while welcoming in a friend from out of town   worth every penny!  for $30 (including a generous tip)  i got hot tea and plenty of delicious dumplings   the xiao long bao is this lovely soft sticky savory treat   the pan fried udon was a pleasant surprise as well   i definitely want to go back 
yum! this place lives up to the hype  my hubs and i heard about it through one of eddie huang's online vignettes and decided to make the trek over from astoria  we ordered four items  the pork soup dumplings  the crab and pork soup dumplings  the beef scallion pancake  and the spicy beef noodle soup  by the way  the soup dumplings are called "steamed buns" on the english menu (wrong translation!)soup came first and it was a little bland and not as spicy as i was expecting it to be    maybe they toned it down for the american crowd? but i just added a lot of chili oil (condiment available on the table) and i was happy  the chili oil also gave it a good kick of flavor  beef scallion pancake was good    super crispy on the outside  almost like it was deep fried  the highlight of our meal though were the soup dumplings! we liked the crab and pork ones the best because they were so flavorful  hubby said that he didn't even need to dip them into the black vinegar sauce  although the sauce was a must for the pork ones  i'd say they tasted even better than the ones at joe's shanghai  four stars! i would've given five if all of the other food was as epic as the soup dumplings 
yes it's a (gasp) big m recommended eating placewell we came on a weekday lunch time packed as can be i have to say i like the number system you a little piece of paper like a deliwe got number 13   lucky or unlucky let the reader decideit's packed it's noisy it's bustling we had hot tea the second we sat down friendly enough waitress tells me no no no to wanting rice cake in my bowl of hot as in cooked sweet soy milk    so ok fine no vegetable buns available okso i order the soy milk and crispy noodles with vegetablesmy friend orders dumplings my soy milk arrives with little slices of fried dough reminiscent of a croutonsoy milk delish and comforting my noodles arrive crispy lovely tastyand where are those dumplings? lady who arrived after us is suddenly eating dumplings which we came to believe were my friends after contacting two waitress finally dumplings arrivewhich these delicate pockets provided a blissful though late experience this is a cash only
must have  veggie dumpling  soup dumpling  noodle soup   there is always gonna be a wait when you come during the rush hours( lunch dinner prime times) the only complain i have is that the soup dumpling is not consistently good  some days are better than others  the skin of the soup dumpling is not always paper thin  (
came here with 3 people for diner and had the beef and chili pepper noodle soup  shanghai pan fried u don  steamed pork buns and steamed crab meat & pork buns if i only tasted their steamed pork and crab meat buns  it would have gotten 4 stars but i tried their other food and it was just so so   not really true taiwanese food despite the decor and the food look the part   flavors just wasn't there the steamed buns were amazing   i still can't figure out how they have so much soup inside the buns   i stood and watched them make it for at least 5 minutes and not once did i see a frozen cube put into the xiao long bao   i do think that the abundance of soup is unique but it's too much   because there is too much soup  there is too much fat in the soup from the meat   no so good in my opinion   if they used leaner meat  it would be better but i'm sure that will affect the amount of soup   i would recommend this place because i could see how some people love the extra soup in the xiao long bao   i'd come back here again but i wouldn't make a special trip out to this place 
we checked in here for some chinese food when we had to make a trip to queens  we had heard about the great chinese places which exist in this neighborhood  we particularly enjoyed the tofu worth vegetables  the pan fried udon noodles and the dumplings  it was very authentic and tasty 
  the best u don noodles  pork soup dumplings  and scallion pancakes you'll find down main st  the restaurant is pretty clean and they give you free green tea as soon as you sit down  the prices are very cheap  $30 will feed 4 people  i always recommend this place and always come here with friends 
decent enough shanghainese fast food  their soup dumplings really are above average  however  the crab version for a buck more tastes pretty much like the plain version  but with crab shells added  get there before noon on weekends  otherwise there can be a bit of a wait  this genre of food is  by nature  greasy (this is not a criticism)  you can't eat too much of it at once  which means you are going to get hungry later!
loveeee this place  not sure if it's the same as the one in shanghai or not  but its delicious! i would recommend beef tendongarlic cucumberpork xlbpickled radish noodle souppan fried pork bunscash only! expect a 15 20 minute wait as well 
nothing too specailnot so good or bad
5 stars  no doubt  came here specifically for the soup dumplings which were absolutely out of this world  our party of four ordered 6 helpings! found them a little difficult to eat at first  but once we got the hang of it we couldn't eat them fast enough! we also ordered a rice patty dish  which was delicious  but the dumplings were the real star here  i also want to make sure to shout out the house tea that was served  soothing and delicious  must have drank 10 cups! if you are heading out to flushing for some authentic chinese fare or dumpling tour  this is a must go  in case you can't find the joint  it has a red awning  no wait on a saturday night  although the place was busy  i can see this being hit or miss  cash only  but you can get out of here for under $20 a person  seriously  go here  this place is top notch 
came here twice with different friends the first time i came everything was amazing  from service to food  the second time  the service was ehhh and food was still great hence the 4 star instead of 5 each time i came  we ordered crab meat  pork soup dumpling and scallion pancake  nomnomnom they were all delicious each time  the soup dumplings here are bigger than the ones from shanghai manor  joe's shanghai and joe's ginger  but i thought that they were too cheap with the crab meat on the crab meat soup dumpling  save yourself a dollar and just get the pork dumplings  they are the same thing also caution!! the last time i came the waitress cashier had inconsistent amount from our bill and thankfully my friend saw the waitress take some money from our bill or else we would have been there forever arguing 
had the pork soup buns  it was okay  enough soup  but not salty enough for my taste  heard it was good and i was around the corner so i gave it a try  i've had better soup dumplings  waiters speak mostly mandarin
this review is just for the soup dumplings!! that's all that's fair to review anyway  we just came here in a group and ordered a pot of soup dumplings each  originally we were going to go to joe's shanghai  but were talked out of it by my friend's boyfriend's family  i haven't had joe's but i definitely don't regret the decision! there were 6 dumplings for 5 95 (i think) and the skin was pretty thin  holding plenty of soup within 
the soup dumplings were delicious! i can't say it's the best that i've ever had or that it blew my mind but it was definitely as good as i expected  the pan fried dumpling buns (might not be actual name) were pretty good too  my friend loved the scallion pancakes also  the noodles weren't that great though  super oily and ehh  the only downside to this place is that it's cash only  for such a busy and popular place  i don't understand why they won't accept cards 
about a ten minute wait on a cold sunday afternoon (we arrived around 1 30)  ordered the sweet soy milk  the doufuhua (tofu fa or tofu in sweet water = dessert)  as well as the spicy wontons  neither my boyfriend nor i is a huge fan of xiaolongbao  so this review isn't even going to touch on that particular dish  as usual  the sweet soy milk came in a bowl with soup spoons  it wasn't as sweet as i would have liked  but was apparently perfect for my boyfriend  worked well  as he drank most of it  the tofufa was decent  but not particularly memorable  the spicy wontons were not what either of us expected  wontons in a spicy oil sauce with thick peanut sauce  definitely heavier than i thought  but i was impressed by the tastiness of the dumpling skin  i can see why the xiaolongbaos here are popular our entire bill was about $8  pros  cheap  and the dumpling skins are really quite goodcons  service was a bit hustle bustle 3 5 stars
juicy plump round little dumplings  fresh and steaming hot in a basket towering one above another  the xiao long bao (xlb) is displayed like jewels on a bed of steamed lettuce  this is what awaits you at nan xiang dumpling house  the michelin rated tire guys in the window don't hurt either when i lived in the city we used to go to goodies but now that place is long gone that's why i am glad there is an xlb place near me that i can always go to  i love the tangy taste of the vinegary soy sauce with the slivers of the ginger are the best and mixes so well with the "soup" in the dumplings  i like the pork ones and this is my favorite place to get it  they also have crab and pork if you want to try it but i am an obstinate pork soup dumpling lover so much that its like i live here  the dumpling skins are not extremely delicate which i like and withstand the poking and prodding and are thick enough to hold in all the soup but be careful with the prongs still and place them gingerly in your soup spoon  blow on it or make a little nibble on top so there is a tiny hole so it can breathe and you can spoon some of the soy sauce into it  i come here almost every week so i can practice gobbling them up and fitting them whole in my mouth  by now i should be a giant dumpling you also have to try the beef scallion pancake prepared very crispy and good to share with 2 friends since they cut it in 3 pieces or you can share with one and fight over the last piece but that's okay because i like to leave more room for the soup dumplings if you want an exotic appetizer you can try the sliced chilled pig ear  if you want to try other dishes you can get the pan fried noodle or the lo mein with the thick shanghainese noodles almost udon like and very thick  go with the pork or beef  the seafood ones are ehh  a lot of the other food is spicy and they have different noodle soups here you can get but for me its all about the xlb   try to order all of your xlb at one time because if you want a second serving it may take a long time for them to make it and you will just be sitting there with nothing to eat in xlb envy of the other tables around you  be prepared to share a table if you are seated in the main dining room  they expanded and so the wait time is not murder like before where its like a 2 hour wait on the weekend but this place is still extremely busy so come early or coming here on a weekday is your best bet  the service here is pretty terrible  its pretty disorganized and even though they expanded they have the same number of staff but more demand and more customers which is trouble if you ask me  its very easy to get forgotten here so wave your arms like a crazy person if you want service and make sure you keep your eye on their list they may skip you and not know  it also helps if you speak mandarin if you want something to drink try the hot soy milk  it always gives me a calming effect whenever i drink it  its just something very comforting about hot soy milk that's made fresh and looks so serene in its large bowl  ask for the sweet soy milk because the plain can be a bit bland  you drink it like a bowl of soup if you dig xlb you gotta try nan xiang be prepared to wait and have patience though 
no need to explain more  they have one of the best xlb in ny  also  their tripe and beef (fu qi fei pian) is something u must get  scallion oil noodles are a plus as well  the beef scallion pancakes are awesome as well 
extremely good xiao long bao for reasonable prices  second time coming here  and the quality was still great  had a variety of dishes here and they all were great  xiao long bao had an extremely amount of juices in it  the majority of the other dishes i had were fresh and good taste would have been a 5 if the service was not terrible  had a waiter that just had terrible manners
this place truly does have good xiao long bao  but everything else is very oily  other dishes are drenched in oil  the service is fast but not very welcoming  i definitely have been to a restaurant with better xiao long bao  less oily more flavorful food  and better service the restaurant itself isn't very appealing in terms of cleanliness  but of course that isn't always something thats important when eating in a chinatown area  i think this restaurant can improve in its food  but i will point out they do have good xiaolongbao and chicken soup 
this place was very good   we had chicken soup  a pork noodle dish  and a spicy beef and tripe dish   the menu wasn't terribly clear   the questions that i thought to ask were answered politely   i didn't realize that the spicy beef and tripe was served cold  but the owner manager offered to nuke it for me   much better!
mixed feelings about this place for sure  obvi that the dumplings are good here and the best in town  but everything else is shit  the wait outside is shit  the service is par  the cleanliness of everything there is shit  down to the cups they use  they pour hot tea in  there are still oil bubbles floating on top  meaning you're drinking some dirty oil  more than a few occasions i smelled chlorine in the "cleaner" cups  so you might be drinking clorox residue? the spoons are gross too  maybe take out is the answer to this place 
get the xiaolong bao and the spring onion pancake with beef the bao lives up to its hype  the skin obviously took some skill to make that supple and delicate  different from joe's shanghai in the other chinatown  i like both of them  and they have their own charm the spring onion pancake with beef was simple  but texture  again  was so right on  will return  if they do these 2 dishes so well already i'd like to see what else they have to offer 
this dumpling house is considered to be the best in this area of flushing by most and it does deliver their hot soup pork dumplings are great and so is the crispy noodles with beef and scallion pancake with beef  i would definitely recommend all of them cash only  on street parking and muni lot right across the street 
finally got around to trying nan xiang xlb and they did not disappoint  first of all  i love seeing the women in the corner making the dumplings  it's very reassuring that they're fresh and made to order  the xlb were definitely bigger than kung fu and tasty to boot! the soup was ace   the joe's shanghai soup is very thick and fatty  the kung fu soup is light and brothy  this was literally the goldie locks option   not too fatty  not too light  perfectly seasoned and delicious  the skin was thin but never broke on me  one of the other staples i order at shanghai places are rice cakes  i enjoyed the rice cakes  not too greasy or over fried  the rice cakes themselves were very "al dente" if almost too al dente  they're also weirdly small? in terms of rice cakes i'd pick kung fu over here and joe's too  but these are hands down my favorite xlb  i'll be back!
service is bad      i always think they hate me   but it's cool i still come back bc it's so cheap good and close they can still take my money
very good taste  although the fried dumpling can improve much better  i only tried few things  they are wonderful  i definitely will go one time a month 
i have been a loyal nanxiang fan long before it became popular and they expanded across 3 storefronts  my favorite is the crab meat soup dumplings  the soup in the dumplings cannot be beaten  in addition  nanxiang also has the shredded beef pepper noodle soup which is also delicious  love everything they have!
i think that the soup dumplings here were decent  better than most  but i still think that joe's shanghai had better dumplings  we ordered the jellyfish and turnip dish and the plate was filled with 95% turnip and the rest was jellyfish which was very disappointing  we also ordered the scallion pancakes  and i was not happy with them  it was over fried in my opinion and i think joe's does a better job with this dish than nan xiang  i also had some noodle dishes and these were only average  i won't be coming back to this restaurant unless it is just to get a fast snack of soup dumplings 
since i don't make the trek out to flushing all too often  i was worried about the wait for nan xiang according to yelpers  we went at 6pm on a saturday and luckily did not have a wait!we tried the following dishes pork soup dumplings (4 stars)crab & pork soup dumplings (5 stars)both really good  though i preferred the crab over the pork  next time i am just going to only order soup dumplings for the entire meal  you have to wait 20 minutes for your pork bun order so if you're hungry  order as soon as you sit down cold plates (4 stars)  jellyfish & turnip seaweed saladpickled cucumbers appetizers scallion pancake (1 star) way too fried chili oil dumplings (1 star) terrible  have had had much bettershu mai (3 stars) filled with sticky rice rather than the traditional filling  which was interesting but not my favorite noodles  rice cakes with shredded pork (2 stars) only tried a bite but they weren't my favorite
best soup dumpling i've ever had i really suggest trying out their cold appetizers if you like exaggerated flavors  cucumber and garlic is my favorite  i eat it with the soup dumpling because the soup inside can be too hot 
they are known for their soup dumplings so it is a must have  but you have to be careful of the hot soup inside of it  just bite a little bit of the skin and drink the soup (  they have the best soup dumplings in flushing! entrees  beef with hot pepper noodle (dry) is good  they also have it with soup but it is a milder flavor  the shanghai udon and beef with crispy noodle are also really good they also have cucumber with garlic and they peel off the skin unlike other places so give it a try if you're a fan of garlic 
what a hidden gem! located in flushing queens chinatown  the menu is fairly reasonable and cheap  we ordered the soup dumpling  it was nicely presented  the xlb was thin  delicate  enormous  and most importantly not busted  it was quite juicy  compared to joe's  the soup broth here is less salty and more bland  overall  i felt like the xlb here is more well made and they take it seriously  my biggest pet peeve is to have xlb served busted!!!
i'd never had soup dumplings before and they came out piping hot! since i wasn't expecting the gush of hot savory soup  we both burnt our tongues and lips a bit  the pain was worth it  the dumplings are so delicious 
consistently good  i've been here too many times to count for more than a decade  whenever friends are visiting from out of town  i bring them here 
i absolutely love this place   this is a very fast paced eating experience   their soup dumplings are absolutely to die for   this is a very busy spot  so prepare to wait on line if you're there over the weekend or during dinner time!  in my experience  employees don't speak much english so prepare to point to what you want on the menu!
you must have the soup dumpling when you come here  first off  the seating my boyfriend and i had was pretty great  we had front row seats to see how the dumpling is made  i love that the chefs made the dumpling fresh by order  i also had the noodles with pork and cabbage  i must admit this place had it the most delicious i've tried so far  not only was the portion bigger than i expected  the taste was phenomenal  the customer service was also great! and the best part  paid parking right across the street 
my boyfriend and i had a quick bite here recently  and i found the restaurant to be just okay  while the food was inexpensive (and their soup dumplings rivaled joe's shanghai's famous ones)  other dishes were lackluster  the beef scallion pancakes  for example  skimped on the beef filling (and the beef that was present tasted a bit crunchy) and the jellyfish dish featured more vegetables than jellyfish  plus  our waitress had attitude  which is something i can never get down with  happy we went here  but definitely prefer joe's shanghai instead 
we came on a monday night and ordered the soup dumplings  scallion pancakes  beef and chilli noodles  pork and cabbage noodles  sweet soy milk  and dough fritters soup dumplings  the meat and broth was good  but the dumpling skin was a little on the thicker side scallion pancakes  these were very crispy and much better than the other scallion pancakes we've had the rest of the food was very meh  both noodles were a little on the salty side and the dough fritters were a little too dense and not too crispy  soy milk was a little diluted but was fine  overall a decent experience  street parking was easy to find on a monday night  service was asian 
i took the advice of some of my fellow yelpers and made my way here for some soup dumplings   i am so glad that i did!  we came here for an early dinner  so they were not that crowded yet   but  with food this good  they were already starting to fill up fast after we were seated   the soup dumplings are excellent as expected   the skin was super thin and delicate  and there was a good amount of soup inside   the scallion pancake with beef was crispy and full of hoisin sauce  scallion  and tender sliced beef   the flavor was lovely  and i would eat this again and again if i could   i have had it other places  and it was never this good   the sliced rice cakes with beef were cooked perfectly and not too oily  yet none of the cakes were stuck together   don't sweat the technique  the cabbage and beef were cut into the most perfect little bites and the sauce was not overwhelming   the pork and vegetable wontons in spicy sauce were the only item that i was not fond of   mostly because of the amount of herb and stem in the filling  half and half with the pork   it was green and tasted like parsley and parsley stem  i do not know if that is exactly what it was  but i did not like it   the sesame paste peanut butter flavor sauce was also too strong for me and did not pair well with the wontons  and they were not spicy at all everything else was great  and i washed it down with a warm bowl of sweet soy milk   the only thing that i missed in ordering was the cold cucumber side dish  which would have been a nice contrast to the hot foods 
my bf saids that " the place sucks because they have no fried rice  and everything is pork"i really like the dumplings and the crispy noodles 
we live in the area and wanted to try this place out since we read about it on the nyt  the place was empty  except for a couple  it had a really small strong of fried oil all over that stuck to our clothes the food was very interesting  all new things and very very flavourful  the very big problem was the waitress  we had this young girl who basically didn't even set up the table or brought us water  we had to ask for everything  also knives and napkins because all she did was point us the forks nobody explained the menu so we ended up getting a lot of bread things that didn't go well together  again  the food was great  but the service and place were really lacking a lot  i haven't read anyone complaining about it so it might be a one time experience  but it was bad  and we had guests and it was deeply embarrassing  this is one of the cases when 18%tip is definitely not right
best soup dumplings in queens  hands down! and if you like chives  get their eggs + chives bun  it's literally chinese chives and eggs  with vermicelli  stuffed in a pastry pocket  they make it fresh daily and its super awesome  also  instead of getting scallion pancakes  which a lot of people will order just because its on the menu  try their radish cake  its fresh shredded radish  a little bit of pork (and i mean very little  but its fine   ) perfectly seasoned   rolled up into bite size pieces  covered in chinese phyllo  and fried  you won't get a better radish cake that's better than this  most places over cook their radish into a gooey mess  nan xiang keeps them with a bite  i hate the parking in downtown flushing  but i'll do it for nan xiang  shoo    i'll even wake up extra early to be the first one in!
awesome xiaolongbao  amazing  simple but delicious i like this place better than the din tai fung i have in seattle  and i was surprised with the size of the dumplings  they seem larger than the ones at dtf  but in this case  bigger was definitely better! more delicious pork juices flowing out of each dumpling i placed on my soup spoon i had high expectations for this place after reading the loads of reviews on yelp and other places  but nan xiang exceeded both my and my father's expectations! delicious and easy  the way it should be 
finally decided to stop by here for dinner after wanting to try their famous soup dumplings since forever  with that being said  one of the best decisions of my life  stopped by after the dinner rush hour (10ish pm) so there was no wait  score! now for the food    appetizers  1  spicy beef & tripe (夫妻肺片)   this is a must order  this is a very popular dish in szechuan and shanghai cuisine and can be found on almost any menu  i've had it at quite a few other restaurants but never as delicious as they've made it here  thinly sliced beef that was not dry (amazing) along with tender sliced tripe in hot chili oil and cilantro  it was so delicious i had to order another plate to go  2  jellyfish turnip salad   skimpy on the jelly fish  this was mostly shredded turnip  worth a try but can definitely do without  3  scallion pancake with beef   another must order  the scallion pancake is super crispy and flakey  not too thick to make it tough  it is rolled with beef and a sweet hoisin sauce  delicious! entrees  1  crab meat & pork soup dumplings   omg can't believe i've waited this long to try this! best soup dumplings i've ever had  they come in an order of six and are filled with hot soup  i've never seen soup dumplings so juicy and bursting with soup before  the skins were perfect  not too thick like other places  the dumplings retained the plump shape till the minute it enters your mouth  no deflating here  their house made vinegar is different from other places as well  it's a bit sweeter which i really liked  2  crispy noodle with seafood   nothing to rave about  can definitely do without  just fill up on more soup dumplings  now finally for the service  i understand this is a no frills type of place but it wasn't very busy at all  how can you not come to fill our water or tea at least once? our scallion pancake came after we were done with our entrees  i hate when food doesn't come out in order because it throws the whole meal off balance  we had to wait a long time before getting our check  however the food is amazing enough that i will definitely be coming back  the hype is real for once  nan xiang definitely puts joe's shanghai to shame 
i know my friends like this place  but came here today with my parents in the morning and what a terrible experience  the service was slow though there were 2 good waitresses  the soy milk might have gone bad (my mom and i both had diarrhea afterwards) and the crispy dough they brought out was cold  soup dumplings were great  but who cares at this point  best to avoid breakfast i think   
super great value for the fried pork buns and enough to share  warm  salty soy milk bowl wasn't great and tasted rather watery  you will feel rushed from the second you are seated  tables are sticky all the time and you will be sitting on a stranger's lap 
great food  a bit pricey for the breakfast items  good service  nice atmosphere 
they didn't have crackers so i have nothing to say  the food was amazing and so was the service i came for the crackers but there was none probably not going to go back cause no crackers but any non cracker lovers check this place out
quick  greasy  unpretentious dim sum  what more can i say? i went one weekend with a friend from out of town  got there around 4pm  and waited for about 10 minutes  we split a bunch of different dishes  all of it was great 
why 5 stars? because the dumplings are absolutely perfect  go for the pork soup dumplings  the fried dumplings were also perfection but the masterpiece is the soup'ers  the udon and beef scallion pancakes were also noteworthy   cheap prices and no frills service add to the flushing atmosphere 
noodles  rice cakes  dumplings and soup dumplings! yum yum yum  they don't serve rice here so be warned  there's always a wait but it's a short time and that's because the food comes out so fast  i love it here and so did our out of town guests! i believe this is a cash only place but don't quote me in that  the only dish i didn't like was the cold cucumbers but that's because i don't like cucumbers!
the real chinatown is actually in flushing  authentic and clean  we come here every time we visit nyc 
like everyone said the best place for xiao long bao (soup dumplings)  the first time i came here was february 2012 it was only one section(store)  now there is 3 sections(taking over other stores)  the store still gets very busy and that's what you know it's good! don't expect too much from the service  it is best to order the xiao long baos so it will come faster  expect more from the xiao long bao  the skin is very thin yet contain a good amount of juice inside (it is freshly made in the side)  after having their xiao long bao  i only come back here for xiao long baos  nowhere else  the other food in their menu is okay it's not outstanding to convince me to come back like their xiao long bao (note  when their busy the quality of the xiao long bao is not as good )
best xiao long bao in nyc  and chicken soup!  if you live in nyc you gotta make a trip out to flushing and spend the day eating around at all the best chinese spots in nyc   in flushing i also recommend  gui lin mei fan  the basement at new world mall  hunan house  the bbq cart outside the chase bank  and the bbq cart outside nan xiang  eastlake seafood  and red bowl noodle soup 
no wait on a thursday night but was seated next to another table almost like we were on their date  soup dumplings are good but not better than joe's ( sorry ) the pan fried dumplings are wayyyy to doughy and thick  not a fan the scallion and beef pancackes were alright but i examined my meat and was kinda weirded out as to what kind of beef was i actually consuming     can't speak for the other chinese dishes but i probably would prefer to go back to joe's 
good food at great prices!   i would give this place 5 stars if the cashier didn't have attitude beware of the younger skanky looking cashier with really small eyes with very fake long eyelashes!  if she gives you attitude  give it right back 
went here for lunch with some co workers  place was pretty busy at lunch time on a friday afternoon  but we were seated immediately  everything was absolutely amazing  our group of 4 shared 3 orders of the pork shrimp soup dumplings  an order of scallion pancakes  an order of fried udon  and an order of the pan fried vegetable noodles  we finished everything and left full and it was only $15 each  including tip  the food came pretty fast  but the service left a little to be desired  will be back this summer 
we arrived on a saturday night around 6 30pm and it was a shorter wait than i had expected    just 15 minutes  the beef and scallion pancakes are a must eat  we also ordered the crispy noodle with shredded pork  which was decent  as for the soup dumplings  the dough wrapper is definitely a little thicker than say joe's  the soup is also a little sweeter  it's good  don't get me wrong  but i still think (despite what many others say) that joe's is my favorite  the bill was less than $20 for the both of us  i wouldn't go out of my way to visit  but could be tempted if i'm in the area 
a definite family favorite when in flushing  this place has what i would say are arguably the best xiao long bao (shanghainese soup dumplings) in new york city   i get pretty picky with my soup dumplings and different places are constantly on my radar but this place has been pretty consistent with the quality of their soup dumplings as of late   each order has six soup dumplings which are filled with warm soup   with or without the ginger and vinegar  these soup dumplings taste delicious!we also usually get their pan fried pork buns  or shen jian bao  though i've had better ones at a different place   their cold side dishes are also pretty good   i would recommend the bean curd with mixed vegetable and the soy peas  cabbage & shredded bean curd which is a little spicy but amazing if you go on a weekend  be prepared to wait since this place doesn't take reservations and usually has a line going out the door   all or most members of your party must be present before being seated   every time we go  we get our basic staples but also branch out and try new things   the soy milk (cold hot  sweet or salty) is pretty good and other dishes such as noodles and rice cakes are definitely worth a try   the only things i would stay away from are the scallion pancake with sliced beef  the fried bun with chives and eggs  and the turnip puff   everyone in my family agreed that these items were too deep fried which made them not as authentic or tasty   needless to say  we've only ordered those items once!  if you want the legit thing  look for these items elsewhere   other than this minor caveat  i give this place a wholehearted recommendation!
i've been trying to find shengjian bao in america and this is the only place that comes close to yang's in shanghai  their xialongbao are much better than joe's  prepare to wait for the table  and service isn't the greatest  but definitely worth the trek to flushing 
i had to visit a place in flushing for the best xlb in nyc  and of course  the yelpers were correct~!!me and my friends visited the place craving for some xlb  a couple of my friends didn't like going out to eat  since he lives in nyc  and i  a yelper had to show him the places to eat  it was extremely awkward the place was packed  but the wait was very brief  maybe  10 minutes  once we were seated  we ordered since we knew what we wanted  deep fried pancake  sui mai  and two trays of xlbs the deep fried pancakes were delicious  the crispiness was perfect and it wasn't as oily as i thought  the pancake crackled and popped in my mouth ;) and the meaty filling was delicious  the crispiness was only on the outside  while the layers were perfectly smooth and filled with chives  t'was a perfect dish  and i recommend it!the sui mai here was very special  it was made in a such a unique way  the sui mai's insides were filled with sticky rice  and there were small meat bits in it  it wasn't meaty  and it wasn't hearty  which i wanted  so i wouldn't recommend this dish to anyone  it's not worth your money or time to end off the adventure of the day  we had to get the xlb  duh doi~!! we ordered two longs of xlbs  and once they came  we devoured them all in a couple of minutes  the small soup content of the xlbs were delicious and plentiful  the juicy meatball in the middle was flavorful and it is amazingly delicious when hot  will be coming back to here for amazing xlbs~!! such an amazing time in nyc~!
it's one of the go to places for a great shanghai soup dumpling fix   their soup dumpling is succulent and filled with right amount of juicy well seasoned soup expected of an extraordinary soup dumpling   now why the 4 star?  not everything on their menu is as good as other restaurants  such as their scallion pancake always served dried  pork & veg  dumpling in spicy sauce has wrong filling and sauce mix is deplorable  jelly fish with turnip has almost no jelly fish  scallion pancake with beef is not up to par  crispy dough is way over cooked so harden instead of crispy      in other words come here for their soup dumpling and a few of the other items  but skip some essential shanghai staples  but they still amazing just for their soup dumpling alone 
it's a small place  looks like a hole in the wall but the food is great and you can't beat their prices! i highly recommend theyre soup dumplings!
tourists go to joe's shanghai   people who actually want good siewlongbao (pork soup dumplings) go to nan xiang   flanked by 66  bangkok and a cantonese restaurant whose name i can never remember  nan xiang is one of flushing's brightest spots for a great meal as many a yelpologist has mentioned  the wait can get long during peak hours   my friend and i went after the prime dinner rush  so we were given a number and seated in about five minutes   always crowded and always bustling  we gave our order immediately and waited for our soupy goodness   we had the pork soup dumplings and the noodles with beef in spicy chili oil (first for me)  and we weren't disappointed   the dumplings are consistently delicious  and the noodles were deliciously greasy and thick on several other occasions  i've had the cold cucumber dish and the duck tongue (duck tongue!)  and those are great for contrasting the steamy fatty dumplings   i generally go for an order of the pork dumplings and an order of the crab ones  and you really can't go wrong with either is it authentic shanghainese? beats the heck out of me   i'm a whitewashed korean  is it delicious? ohyoubetcha  is it better than joe's shanghai? ohyoubetcha   er? if you go to nan xiang based on my review  and are disappointed  kindly let me know  and i will apologize  and give you the opportunity to buy me dinner somewhere else 
very mediocre! the noodle cake dish was tasteless and the dumplings were so doughy  the only redeeming dish was the beef scallion pancakes  the service was the worst part  but the food wasn't far behind  i wouldn't recommend this place 
soup dumplings are amazing and handmade on site in the small restaurant  as a result  you wait a long time for a table and for the food but good things come to those who wait! not a huge selection but they know their wheelhouse and stay in it  don't expect amazing service or great ambiance  it's good food at cheap prices  cash only 
got their pork soup dumplings as well as their beef scallion pancake  their soup dumpling was amazing  definitely worth the wait  maybe even better than joe's shanghai in manhattan  the dumpling is literally filled with soup  my first bite  i squirted out a bunch of soup at my food partners' face  my bad  anyhow  the skin was nice and thin  the pork was up to par from the other places i have tried  but the beef scallion pancake was bad  that killed my experience here  there was too much hoisin sauce that it took over the whole pancake  tsk tsk   you did me wrong   but i'll be back for their soup dumplings  )
3 5 stars  this place used to be better  nowadays more of a madhouse   especially on weekends with the unruly wait  sometimes the service gets spotty during peak hours this is the best in ny (yes  even compared to the tourist traps in chinatown)  everything is good  but could improve starting with craftsmanship of every dish  the standard dishes like crab meat soup dumplings  beef scallion pancakes  and even shanghainese rice cake (alternatively noodles) should upgrade on presentation (comes out a mess on the dish sometimes) and pack a more flavorful kick in every bite they are all a bit bland  even compared to real jiangzhe regional cuisine that is slightly sweeter by default this place is still good enough to be recommended  when i ever have time to go to flushings  this is always on my list  seems that going during off hours are a good bet if you are not looking to wait hoping to get your chow on asap 
was super excited to try this place after seeing all the raves about it on yelp  love their spicy beef with tripe  spicy and very tasty! their steamed crab meat and pork bun are mediocre in my opinion because lacks crab flavor  i still think joe shanghai's pork buns are better  i'm not a fan of scallion pancakes but their scallion and beef pancakes are good very crispy definitely better than other places i've tried!
been wanting to come here for years   finally! although i personally don't think their soup dumplings are the "best in new york" as a lot of people i know claim  they are good  bigger  but u get only 6 per tray  their side dishes are the winners though  on my visit  we got 1  pork soup dumplings2  spicy beef and tripe  excellent  it's swimming in hot oil and red pepper seeds  but it's really not as spicy (mild+) as it looks 3  noodle in soy sauce  sounds simple  but so good  the noodles are freshly homemade and are nice and chewy  need nothing more than a lil oil and nice soy sauce there are also scallion pancake with beef  stir fry rice cake   etc  i'll need to try in the future  this place is def worth a visit wait wasn't so bad on a sunday afternoon  10mins 
delicious dumplings at a cheap price! my go to dumpling place in queens  definitely must try 
2 steamed pork buns (cuz we liked this one better)steamed crab meat & pork bunscucumber & garlicran out of spicy beef tendon  (substituted slice pig ear with spicy saucepopular yelp reviews of the scallion pancake with sliced beef  so we had to try it out for ourselves  it was delicious but someone at our table found a piece of hair in there  complained and they offered another dish  overall it was good  better than joe's shanghai 
the best chinese lunch ever  fresh delicious $ loved it  we had the beef with garlic and general tao  im pretty picky on chinese and it was awesome  will be back for sure 
amazing xiao long bao soup dumplings!absolutely a must have at this place  came during a busy saturday morning lunch hour and the waitress told us would be about 20 mins for our soup dumplings  not a problem  while we waited we ordered the scallion pancake  oily and fluffy just as it should be  order it! also got the fried dough (aka chinese cruller in disguise)  mehhh nothing special  you can easily get some from the flushing markets for cheap  no complaints about service this time  but don't expect it to be 100% on point though super wallet friendly and perfect warm soup dumplings to hit the spot on a cool autumn day!don't be "that guy" with the card    cash only!
it pains me to remove a star  ha!i have been here probably 3 dozen times in the last 3 or so years  i know what to expect in terms of  "service" at chinese restaurants  the food is still 5 stars but i have to remove a star for the following reasons they expanded the restaurant 2 times since i have first been here  but the amount of staff remains the same  so now you can sit down faster but you wait longer for menu  food  utensils  basically anything you need they don't recognize us  i feel like since i go here so much  we should at least get a nod or something  maybe even a smile  nope  and i always tip well even though service is non existent  last time they forgot one of my orders  they gave it to the table next to us that came later and probably didn't even order it but decided to eat it anyway  when this was finally realized they said they ran out of it  i have very low expectations for service but come on dont forget my order completely and not fix it 
before my trip  i usually like to do some research on some local food   just to make it more interesting  something to look forward to aside from biz meetings  so this place seemed to be the place for soup dumplings or xlb as many have referred to  location  i guess it's good as long as you can find parking in this crazy side or chinatown  been to flushing many times over the years  and it has really grown  this is on a tuesday night  and yet  i had to go round and round to find parking  anyway  was able to find parking between this place and the new world food court which i was curious to check out  when i came in around 730p  i was seated to share a table of another single eater  service was fast and friendly  which is not typical in a chinese restaurant  i was hungry  so ordered the traditional pork xlb and a beef noodle soup  the soup came first and it was disappointing before i even taste it  it wasn't the taiwanese style i was expecting  the soup was more clear  but it has some spice to it  the beef was cut into little cubes with no spinach or other ingredients  it tasted fine  but very simple   something i could have made at home  ok  so the xlb came next  i think it was about 6 to an order  i've had my share of xlb including china  and these are indeed some of the best i've had in awhile  the skin was thin enough to hold the broth  but not overly where it's like a large clump of dough on top  it stayed in its form nicely and wasn't flat  the broth was plenty juicy and steaming hot (yes  becareful of eating it whole)   flavor was spot on with a little sauce  i quickly finished all 6 of them and ordered another 6   about 10 min went by and i realized i was actually kinda full as i ate it so fast  but the xlb was here  so i took my time to savor it the 2nd time around as with many places around chinatown  make sure to bring cash  i thought they took cc  as that was the other reason i didn't want to eat at that big food court  but i ended still paying cash here  if this was just for the xlb  i would give 5 stars  but the noodle was a total disappointment  and their limited menu knocks it down to 4 
it's a great place with authentic south eastern chinese food  we've been there for quite a few times and love this place  the price is reasonable too  would recommend to people who are from shanghai and hangzhou areas 
the spicy wontons are really good too   not really spicy but has a great flavor!!i think this place has the best soup dumplings i've ever tasted!
this is my favorite favorite favorite restaurant for soup dumplings   whenever i have the craving  i dream about eating and start drooling from the beautiful pictures i remember in my head 
this is the restaurant that i visit every other time when i am in flushing   no 5 stars from me because half the time i got the rude waitress  and that the restaurant is so cramped that often times we have to share the table with other people   their flagship soup dumplings definitely live up to par   definitely order them as soon as you sit down before you order any dish as it could take up to 30 minutes!  other dishes i'd recommend  fish noodle soup with pickled cabbage (lots of fish)  pork chops noodle soup (huge pork chop)  and scallion pancake with beef slices   make sure to ask to have hoisin sauce on the side for the scallion pancake    several times they put way too much sauce in the pancake and ruined the dish   i don't recommend their rice balls    this is the only place where i had rice balls without pickled radish in them   i also don't recommend the hot soy milk soup    they put tiny fish in it  making it very fishy which is not what i'd expect   oh  one last tip  don't go at peak hours because you'll have to wait outside for a long time   while the food is good here  it's not worth waiting for more than 30 minutes   there are plenty of other great restaurants in town!
best soup dumplings ever! we usually get the pork and crabmeat flavors  but really you can't go wrong with any of them  make sure they are the first orders that you place in because it takes roughly 20 minutes for it to be done  shanghai pan fried udon and the rice cakes w shredded pork are also really delicious  yes  they are a bit greasy  but what do you expect when they are pan fried?! mmm yummy  i do want to note that the scallion pancakes haven't been consistently good the past few times i went  they were all dough and maybe 2 3 tiny pieces of scallion in each slice  minus half a star because of that the place does feel a little cramped so you may not have much elbow room and you may feel like you're sitting on top of your neighbor especially during the colder months with all the heavy jackets  but the delicious soup dumplings all but make up for it  so really a 4 5 5 if only we could give half stars 
authentic shanghainese cuisine  all i gotta say is it tastes just like the nan xiang i had back in shanghai every morning for years  the place is super cheap and the food is just wonderful  just a heads up this place is cash only! the service could be better though not gonna lie 
after hearing so many great things about this dumpling house  we finally decided to take 7 train and got here at 12 to see if it lives up to its name  i am surprised to see a line waiting for a table here already  luckily  we only waited for 20 minutes before we got seated  we were pretty hungry so we ordered a lot from the menu  we got the famous soup dumplings (pork and the crab ones)  scallion pancake with sliced beef  stir fried low mein  stir fried crispy noodles with beef  chicken soup  and turnip pastry  the soup dumplings are definitely one of the best in nyc  the skin is very thin and there is a lot of juice inside  the ground meat inside is tender and meaty  overall  it deserves an a for their soup dumplings  the scallion pancake with beef is also delicious  they deep fried the pancake so it is crispy and chewy  unfortunately  they skim on the beef  the stir fried shanghai low mein is very good  everybody loves that dish  on the other hand  the crispy noodles with beef is also very tasty  especially if you like the yellow crispy wavy noodles  i was not a fan but i was impressed  finally  the chicken soup has an amazing broth and it comes in a small bowl  we did share it among 4 but it is more meant for one person  we ended up spending $15 per person for 4 people  we were really full and our pocket is happy 
first meal in 30° ny weather and what? yes  the broth in the pork dumplings are so good  the braised beef noodle soup is also delish!
if you're in the flushing area and are craving xiao long bao (soup dumplings)  i would definitely recommend that you try this place  their soup dumplings are large  fresh and has a very good amount of soup! 6 to a tray and it's about $6 7 for the pork+crab ones which i find delicious! i've had soup dumplings in a lot of different places and nan xiang makes one of the fresher  better tasting ones!  i always pair soup dumplings with rice cakes! usually i like chicken because the soup dumplings have pork already! my only criticism with their rice cakes is that sometimes it's on the salty side and the chicken slices are not as big as i would like them to be (in comparison to other restaurants in the area)  overall it's still a wonderful dish chock full of vegatables (choy  mushrooms  bamboo etc) and i mean i just can't have soup dumplings without rice cakes! if it's crowded  be prepared to sit unusually (almost but not quite uncomfortably) close to others  just because it's not an extremely large restaurant and their seating arrangements can be tight  service is mediocre  but i think once you get your hands on the soup dumplings  your focus will be on enjoying your meal and not the people around you! ~chow! =]
the xiao long bao here are the best   thinner skin than joe's shanghai  so some may prefer joe's better   more juicy than ding tai fung in ca and taipei   they also have lots of great side dishes    and last but not least their pan fried pork buns are fantastic  done perfectly  similar to street vendors in taipei's night markets 
nan xiang dumpling house's soup dumplings are sooo good  i love a good soup dumpling with a lot of soup inside  every time i go  i'm not disappointed  they are definitely the best place in flushing to get soup dumplings and their noodles are pretty good as well  the only thing was their service was not the best  i ordered the same time as the table next to me and they got their dumplings 15 minutes before us  however when i did complain about that  they gave us a free soy milk drink  overall  i'm always satisfied with the food and price whenever i eat here 
very good & affordable dim sum  extraordinary soup dumplings + enjoyed pancake sliced beef (despite another review that dissed them)  unassuming but clean w  prompt  friendly service  it's worth the 7 line to flushing to enjoy this place  past visits had the place packed  today showed up very early afternoon   easy peasy 
the best soup dumplings in brooklyn and queens    this place is a must try if you love soup dumplings    their food is pretty good as well 
coming from california (originally) i had a pretty narrow view of what chinese food was like  so when we visited flushing recently  our son and his friends took us to a number of places to give us a vision of what we were missing i'm not sure how i lived over half a century without experiencing xio lóng bāo  but it's a new favorite  and this is now my benchmark for what a dumpling should be  there are a number of other great dishes on the menu (we had several)  all in all  and outstanding experience 
fortunately  their food makes up for their terrible service  soup dumplings are my absolute favorite and this place definitely meets my expectations!  such good comfort food for some flavorful pork and soup that perfectly fills your spoon  the skin is thin  but of course not too thin that it erupts on you  the scallion pancake is also yummy as well  a nice golden brown crisp with a chewy center service always sucks here  i get my food on time but the question is when are they going to take my order and whether i will be hydrated   there was this one incident when we asked for tea while he gave us our food  looked at us and completely zoomed off somewhere  we had to physically get up to one of the waiters to ask for it and order more food  then   once i get my soup dumplings i totally forget why i was annoyed tehehehe 
the dumpling is decent  not the best but good enough to get your soup dumpling fix  the staff is beyond rude   but it's flushing  not the cleanest place to dine at  but again  it's flushing  they open until very late  so you wouldn't feel  notice  or care  if you go after having a few drinks at the bar 
hands down the best xiao long bao i've had anywhere!  my grandmother and i had a special recipe for these soup buns  but even we can't get close to how much soup is each of these little treasures!  the dumplings (the xiao long bao) are chock full of delicious pork broth  and i absolutely love the beef noodle soup   it's absolutely delicious  even after i moved to massachusetts  i still come back to flushing just for these amazing buns   i've been coming here since it was a one room restaurant that seated about 15 people  and i'm ecstatic that it's expanded so much over the 8 years we've been going   my family usually orders 6 for 6 people!  (each order comes with 6 soup buns as well)here's a trick for eating buns if you haven't seen them much before    place them on a soup spoon  pierce a side with a chopstick  and them empty the soup into the spoon   saves your mouth from getting burned!don't be put off by a line; the food is well worth any wait super authentic and a home away from home 
i come here almost once a month with the family they have the best xlb  the only issue is the wait  so def come here early to beat the crowd 
lunch for 2  well under $20 bucks  a great deal considering how tasty and filling it was we started with a piping hot scallion pancake which was simple and great and followed up with an order of spicy beef dumplings and vegetable dumplings  both were perfect and devoured in moments  you also get a copious amount of blazing hot tea on the house  really hit the spot the wait was about 15 mins to be seated and the line was out the door (sucks on a cold day)  but it was ultimately worth it since it was such an enjoyable meal  four stars 
came here since eddie huang dropped by  but man am i glad i did  the food here is just on point  we ordered an assortment of dishes and it all came out in a timely fashion  too good!
love the soy beans and bean curd in sesame oil   the spicy beef in chilli oil over noodles was excellent  the fried pork chops over noodle soup was tasty  the porkchops were a bit sweet for my taste but everyone seemed to like it  the beef and tripe dish was spicy but oh sooo good   the pig ear dish was just a bit spicy but realy good the seafood crispy noodles were very crispy but the seafood was a bit on the sweet side to me   the pork dumplings were good and the skin is thinner than joe's shanghai but on my 5 point scale  here's how it breaks down taste   3 5 very good but not phenomenal  soupiness   5 the amount of soup is excellent  thiness of skin   5 you can even tear the skin with the tongs if not careful  tenderness of the meat   4 5 pretty tender and not hard at all 
excellent soup dumplings!  the menu was a bit limited  but i really enjoyed everything we ordered   it's definitely the place to go for xiao long bao in flushing 
must order the soup dumplings  super cheap  super delicious  super fast 
this used to be our favorite breakfast spot until today  we didn't have a long wait which was nice  but once seated we had to wait to ask a waitress for a menu  after receiving our menus we waited almost 15 minutes before seeing anyone to order  we were excited to order our usual turnip cakes and spicy beef tripe only to find they didn't have it    umm we were there at9 45am! how could they not have it!!? once we ordered out food came out in drips and drabs   not the usual quick speed  which was fine  whatever maybe they had a new chef or wait staff   we had to keep asking the waitress where our food was and only when asked it came out  we ordered the jelly fish and turnip and got 95% turnip! never been to a place that didn't have at least a 50 50 ratio of turnip and jelly fish  not sure what's more sad    that we won't be returning or that this place is going down hill  i think i'll be frequenting ok ryan more 
came back and they expanded again the other way  so they are now 3x size of the original rest so plenty of seating  and they found a rhythm to getting their dumplings out in a more timely fashion  granted they r more han likely the last thing to come out of what unordered but they are quite good  so def come and taste the authenticity  and watch as the army of dumpling makers go to town making these crafty little masterpieces of deliciousness  note cleanliness is variable but that's typical of chinese rest 
service  3 5 waitresses hustle and bustle around  don't expect to be able to sit around too long while eating here as this place is packed  also  don't expect much privacy either bc the tables are squished together and if you come with just one other person  you will be sitting 1 inch away from another couple i ordered the crab and pork bun  pork bun  and the pork rice cake and enjoyed them all   the dumpling skin does rip easily  but the soup inside is flavorful  crab plus pork was def  better than the regular pork because there was more texture with crab inside 
very fond of the pork pan fried dumplings as well as the soup dumplings  the seafood soup is good  as well  but bit bland  but it's nothing that some soy sauce can't fit    or even the broth from the soup dumplings  the one downside is i was expecting a more variety of dumplings 
after spending almost three months in europe and being deprived of good chinese food  i had my eye set on this place after doing some research  i went with two other friends  one white and one asian american  my friend who was white said to me after we took our seats  "do you know how i know this restaurant is good? it's because i am the only white person in the entire restaurant " boy was she right! both she and i were blown away by the soup dumplings especially that first burst of flavor when you bite into it! but please show some respect and do it right! don't poke a hole! bite into it and let your mouth fill taste the savory  sweet delicious juices that fill your mouth all at once  yummyyy also  what i really like about this restaurant is its prices! very cheap and decent  i'll also say that you should expect a line when you come on the weekends as it is very popular  i would also recommend the scallion pancake (a little too bland for me but they're freshly fried so i would still order them anyway) and the sweet soybean milk (the latter for a more personal reason     b c i was raised on that kinda stuff)  the service is also very good for a chinese restaurant  the staff is attentive but not too in your face about it  i would definitely come back again! the prices    were around $6 for 6 soup dumplings  not bad at all! and $1 25 for a giant bowl of sweet soybean soup!!!
well  since i've been to the real branch in shanghai  i figured  why not try this one and see how authentic and good it is    hmm   a bit overrated   first  yes  i know it's always busy but when me and my friends (3 all together) walked in  we waited like a good 2 minutes before someone seats us and there were some empty tables so they can't be that busy   in fact  i think they're short staffed   the waiter tends to disappear from time to time and we pretty much have to flag them down to take our orders and this is like 10 15min in after we sat down   now  the food came pretty quick and it was all made fresh     you must order the steamed pork soup dumplings since that's what they're famous for and it was pretty good   but i think i would prefer a less starchy soup base   the pan fried dumplings were good with thin skin so it's not too doughy   but not sure if the price justifies it    the scallion pancake with beef slices   well  it was the marinated beef and served with hoisin sauce so it can't go wrong   i would order this again over the regular scallion pancake sweet sticky rice   this was way too big and the rice was a bit hard    not very good for digesting and only a bit of the fried curlers were in the middle so a bit off balance right there for me    the pork chop soup noodles were good   i would say this place has one of the better ones compared to the other shanghainese joints i've tried my overall conclusion is  not bad  but not like "wow "  it's definitely overrated so don't travel far just to try this place   you can probably find decent ones in chinatown and they're just as good if not better when you balance it all out 
first time trying the scallion pancake with beef   so good! topped with oyster sauce and scallion  thought it sounded weird when i first saw it on the menu but was tastefully surprised  the soup dumplings are of course as yummy as people here say  i have to admit the dumpling skin is better than joe's in chinatown service was just really crappy  needed to flag down the waiter to order  made eye contact to ask for tea and waitress nodded  i see her grabbing the kettle and pouring for another table  thinking she would come over  but nope  just walked away and put it down  yeah  she did forget we ordered for more tea also for those who care about the restaurant rating  it's a c!
the food is good and reasonably priced  we had the xiao long bao  stir fry rice cakes with pork  fried dumplings  fried pork buns  service was decent and prices were reasonable  we would go back again 
their pork xlb is amazing! loved it  we had their scallion pancakes and beef scallion (both excellent)  we went on a sunday (a group of seven) and only waited like 10min wasn't too bad  overall good experience 
i ordered plenty of things here   sweet soy bean milk  noodles with scallions  soup dumplings and sweet sticky rice   they were all just okay   there's a c cleanliness rating on the outside of the restaurant and a lady in the kitchen with the flu!  she must have sneezed 10 times as i walked in   face all red and nose leaking mucus everywhere!  i glared at her and i think management sent her away   maybe i've eaten at din tai fung way too many times   but the dumplings were a bit larger than i expected and not as good 
place is so packed    but food is delicious  they do not like pictures taken off the staff    so please be respectful of that  it's cash only but sure is worth it 
caught attitude for asking for sugar for my soy milk   forgot my soup buns (after waiting 40 minutes   standard is "20minutes"  no vinegar i the table  cups of tea were empty and still no one filled  shanghai noodles were spicy bc the the kitchen probably did not clean the wok after using it  1 star is being generous  michelin star?   i have to question when that was given and who they gave the review
it's cool to see how east and west coast does the same food differently  for example  the soup dumplings (xlb) here had a lighter tasting broth  almost like chicken broth  din tai fung (i'm classifying as west coast since that's the only location in the states) has a deeper  "porkier" broth  both had a great thin skin with tasty meat filling  also  the scallion pancake with beef (beef rolls) here uses a very thick and doughy scallion pancake  i'm used to the thin pancake  which results in lots of layers of pancake beef pancake beef  this one was still very good though  even if i felt that they skimped on the meat  at least there wasn't cilantro in this one!the line seemed very long  but it was only about a 20 minute wait for saturday lunch  the service was pretty friendly and efficient  and i couldn't get over how cheap everything was compared to the same food in manhattan  definitely worth the trip to flushing!
nanxiang has one of the best soup dumplings in flushing! if you're going to come here on a saturday   sunday for brunch good look finding a table! they get a 4 star because the waitress can be a bit rude at times  my boyfriend is highly convinced that it's just the way they talk but i don't know      i really recommend the scallion pancake with sliced beef! the scallion pancake is so crispy and satisfying!!! i love it  i personally prefer the salt soy bean milk over the sweet one  would come back!
the pork soup dumplings were ok  lots of soup and thin skin  but the soup was not too flavorful  the crab soup dumplings were awesome though  lots of flavorful soup  the plain pork soup dumplings' soup is not as good as joe's shanghai's (which is kinda greasier than normal  this one is slightly under greasy) but the skin and overall authenticity is better than joe's shanghai's however  both soups could be sweeter and or more savory  it was a little one dimensional with the salty flavor  i'm picky because i am from a place with two din tai fungs  but this place is excellent for chinese food in new york  though not worth an hour wait if it is crowded (always is on weekends)  there was no wait on a weekday  the fried noodles with seafood were hong kong style where you mix it up and the super crispy noodles turn softer for a varied texture  quite satisfying  fast service 
if you're going here  i'm assuming you're going for the steamed pork dumplings (soup dumplings)  i have a favorite soup dumpling place in boston (gourmet dumpling house)  and have yet to find a place that does soup dumplings like gdh does  but nan xiang dumpling house comes pretty close  they also have some very cheaply priced chinese food that seem to be good  but i wouldn't go for the scallion pancakes  they weren't anything special  we also ordered  shanghai pan fried udon (?) which was pretty good  but a tad on a cold and hard side  if it was warm and fresh  i'm sure it would've tasted even better  all in all  good for soup dumplings and cheap chinese food  cash only folks!
restaurant is just like any other business  u will not go around the city to look for te cheapest doctor or the cheapest lawyer  so why food?and wow  this is good xlb? what? really? i love xlb  so i went all the way from city to try this place  oh boy they suck  crab meat xlb was very tasteless  i did not taste crab meat  and the pork xlb did not have much flavor too food cost is so sky high fir the market but their price on the menu for xlb was so low  that is why i am not very surprised that their xlb is tasteless  to have real crab meat in there with good pork? ya right small menu  that is the only smart move that this restaurant have  low price  large quantity  poor service  tasteless crab meat xlb  i'm just glad that i did not have a food poison 
really great food  the xiao long bao was the highlight (i had never had xiao long bao before)   don't let the 'c' sanitary inspection rating deter you    i feel like the lack of cleanliness adds a little something to the taste of the dumplings  (just kidding!) the food was great  the atmosphere was busy  and the value was incredible   my wife and i ate dinner on a saturday night for $30 with tip (unheard of!)  our waiter was like an asian ron swanson    no nonsense and to the point   fine by me  i was there to eat  not to make friends anyway    i will definitely go back  and i recommend it if you're in the mood for good food and an energetic dining room  bring cash  they only take cash 
i love this place  everytime i go there is always a line  so expect to wait atleast 20 minutes before being seated  it is always crowded too  i always get a lot of the steamed pork dumplings which are always fresh  hot and very juicy  this is also the place i tried jellyfish for the first time and really liked but the next time i ordered it it was not seasoned as well as the first time but nothing a little soy sauce couldn't fix  i also always get the spicy tripe and beef as i love spicy food  the szechuan peppers in the sauce will make your mouth a little numb  also if you want to try some of their dessert then go early because they never have the sweet soybean curd that i've been dying to try  seriously  never  because they always run out and it makes me want to have it even more but all my friends are night owls and do not do early brunch 
this is my favorite soup dumpling place  it is so much better than joe's shanghai i always get the crab meat soup dumplings  scallion pancake  and shanghai pan fried noodles  one time i went during lunch time on a weekend and had to wait 15 min for a table for 2  but it was worth the wait  hehe
came on a weekday right before noon to avoid the crowds and was able to sit for two right away  ordered the shengjianbao right away as it takes 20 minutes to cook  i like getting sweet soy milk  although my family loves getting the salty soymilk and youtiao (fried dough) as an appetizer  the youtiao is very fresh and soft  good enough to eat plain  the beef wrapped in scallion pancake was excellent as well  of course everybody comes to eat the soup dumplings  which i like because they're lighter than joe's shanghai's soup dumplings  but which one i like better depends on the day  as both are always tasty  prepare to be stuffed and loaded with carbs! next time i'll probably order some of the cold appetizers to balance things out 
for people looking for soup dumplings in flushing there's not much better then this  it's a small intimate place with a simple menu to match  as much as i love the soup dumplings i also love the scallion pancake with beef  the prices are great as well  2 people can go in  stuff their faces and have a few beers and manage to only spend $40 for the whole thing  i only found this place over the summer(3 months ago) and i've already been there 6 times in 3 months  i don't frequent any place like that  i highly highly recommend!!!
everything has already been said!must get the soup dumplings (pork is slightly cheaper and better worth the price)  seafood noodle soup is tasty but very few pieces of fish and the type of noodle is not the kind i prefer (my go to is ho fan)  the end result is a little starchier than what i usually get  and this time  i ordered the tripe too  soo delicious  perfectly seasoned spiciness! i wish they had better proportions though  more tripe  less sliced beef!and soybean milk and fried dough are staples here too
very good food and quick service  udon noodles  dumplings  steamed buns and scallion pancakes were all delicious and fresh  i'd read that it could be very busy so we were there for an early dinner before a mets game  i would definitely go back 
i'm sorry but i'm gonna have to throw some major shade at any reviewer who is not shanghainese and has anything bad to say about these soup dumplings  that's like if someone chinese came to america and decided that mcdonald's has better burgers than shake shack  sorry but nope  your opinion is invalid  i am shanghainese and i effing know my soup dumplings  and these are great (regular is fine  no need to get the crab ones)  their other stuff is all pretty good too    yu pian (fish) noodle soup is simple but hits the spot  niu rou jia bing (beef  hoisin sauce  sandwiched between pancake ish things) is another one of my faves  you can't really go wrong here  great & authentic shanghainese food  pro tip  when we sit down  we immediately give the server 1 2 orders of xlb  due to the wait    then we settle down and decide what else we want to getalso  please understand that if you go to a restaurant with authentic chinese food  you are probably going to get  err  authentic service too  have some understanding for cultural differences; chinese servers tend to be a bit more brusque  this is not a struggling restaurant  they are trying very hard to keep up with demand  they are working to feed you but not to please you  please don't come here expecting amazing food at great prices (which you should find) and amazing  friendly service (which you won't)  then take off stars  that's just asking too much 
delicious authentic chinese breakfast in flushing  best "yo tiao" i've had  lightly crisped on the outside  warm and doughy on the inside  shao long tang bao soup dumplings is delicious as well  joe's who??
great xiao long bao soup dumplings! also had the stir fried udon which were also amazing 
mmm soup dumplings   since i don't always venture into flushing  i was so used to eating the xlb at joe's shanghai in manhattan   and not even in chinatown  in midtown  __  the xlb at nan xiang is so flavorful and fresh  i feel like joe's can't even be compare to it   i prefer the dough  the meat and the soup of nan xiang's i came here once before and was excited to try it out again 2 years later  but with my family   after our trip to the west coast  eating xlb at dtf puts our standards pretty high   dtf is still at the top of our list  but nan xiang is a great option on the west coast we started with the pig ears (my mom's choice)   not a fan favorite because there was not a lot of flavor to it   i really wanted to get the shaved beef tendon  but they were out  so disappointing  ( we weren't too hungry  so we just went with 2 baskets of xlb   one of each  pork and crab   the pork was fantastic   the crab was ok   there was almost little to no crab in there we also got an order of the seafood udon noodles which was delicious!  it was stir fried with pieces of white fish  shrimp and baby bok choy   everyone really enjoyed this there is always a wait  but we probably waited around 20 25 minutes when they gave us a quote of 15 minutes   not too bad  because it helped us work up our hunger service was decent   the table next to us sat down about 15 minutes after us and they got their food before us  what? and it is cash only   so bring your bills when you come 
hands down best xiao long bao soup dumplings!!
i've been here twice with my family  the first time the service was extremely slow and the waitress was forgetful  so we got a free order of xiao long bao (also one of the things that took forever)  but still  the food was great the second time was better  i guess it wasn't as crowded  we ordered scallion pancake w  sliced beef  2 orders of xiao long bao  pan fried udon with chicken  and some kind of chicken noodle dish that the waitress recommended (can't remember the name)  this place is known for their xiao long bao  so obviously  it was delicious  the dough is chewy and the meat is so flavorful  its even better with the black vinegar and ginger sauce because it gives them a nice tartness  the udon dish was mainly udon noodles with a few bits of chicken and vegetables  but luckily i love udon  so i ain't complaining  the chicken noodle dish was really good  the noodles were perfectly cooked and the soup was really nice  the only complaint was that it lacked any vegetables  the waitress told us that its supposed to be that way ( maybe its a shanghainese thing  the scallion pancake w  sliced beef was the only thing we didn't eat at the restaurant because by the time it arrived we were full lol so we just took it home  it was nice but too greasy for me 
as far as soup dumplings houses go  nan xiang is my favorite  the space itself has ample seating so the wait is never too long  both soup dumpling options are delicious and there are many other choices including noodles or appetizers  i highly recommend the scallion pancakes  especially if you add a bit of the dumpling sauce onto it 
joe shang bye hands down  the best soup dumplings in nyc here at nan xiang  i know this may be a controversial statement    but for those who know    they know that this is not the case  nan xiang blows joe shanghai out of the water for the best soup dumplings in queens town and everywhere else for that matter   it can be a pain in the butt to get seating as this place gets packed during peak hours  but if you're flexible with your eating time  try going during a non peak hour and you should have no problem getting seated  getting supped  and getting that soupy goodness into your broken soupless soul  scallion pancakes are on point  and a wonderful counterpoint to the soft  chewy  soupy goodness that is the scallion pancakes  noodle dishes like the spicy beef noodle is just    meh  not good  not bad  but the star here is the soup dumpling  it comes in two flavors  pork  or crab & pork  i'm partial to the pork  but many others prefer the one mixed with crab  and i suppose that's a bit rarer  what i particularly like about this place is the beauty of the dumpling skin  you have to handle a lot of soup dumplings with more care than an ebola infected leper  because one wrong move  and you'll tear the skin and the juice will come pouring out  but nan xiang has a wonderful dumpling skin that doesn't tear  poke  or pop  and yet remains wonderfully tender  but sufficiently chewy  legends say that ip man visits their shop once a day to beat their dumpling skins to give them their soft  and pliable toughness long live nan xiang 
the xiao long baos here i think are the best in flushing  the waits some days are long but it's always worth it  the noodle dishes aren't amazing but solid  i personally like the beef and pepper noodle soup and the rice cakes with shredded pork is money  the cold apps showcased near the entrance are worth a go also!
great option in flushing   awesome that they deliver to parts of queens through flushingfood com
great place to get the traditional xlb  they open earlier than most of the restaurants near by  great service 
great food  always super busy  try to get there early if you can! the crab and pork soup dumplings are great  4 5 stars just because i have had better dim sum in my days  but it's still very good  and cheap too!!!
one of my best friends lives in flushing and was staying across the street to prep for her wedding  she recommended that we all have breakfast here before we started getting ready for the wedding they open at 8 am  and yes we weren't the only ones waiting outside  the place fills up quick i tell ya  i was shocked we ordered their pork soup dumplings and the crab and pork soup dumplings (you get 6 dumplings per order)  along with an order of seafood udon and green onion pancakes wrapped around beef  i was impressed with the soup dumplings  being shanghainese myself  it's hard to impress me with soup dumplings  but the skin was perfect  not too thick but not too thin where the soup would easily break through when you lift if up  it has a good amount of soup in it too  very rich and flavorful (which means it has more pork fat in it haha yummm soo good for you)  the crab and pork dumplings were good too  very juicy  they come out very hot which means the soup inside is piping hot (if you're not careful you will burn yourself)  how i eat it to prevent burning myself is to bite a small hole in it  either on the side or on the very tip and gently slurp the soup out then i add some vinegar and devour the rest of the dumpling for first timers  i recommend asking for a bowl so if you do spill your soup everywhere  you can drink it out of the bowl the udon and green onion pancake were pretty good  i prefer the plan green onion pancake versus the ones with beef  i'm not a huge fan of the sauce they put in it price is also cheap!i definitely want to try their other shanghainese dishes definitely going to bring others here to try their dumplings  i haven't tried joe's yet  so that will be another food adventure when i come back to new york  )  grateful to the beautiful bride that brought me here! cheers!
really good! the dumplings are everything! i never had it dipped in vinegar  the best i must say  i also had crunchy noodle with beef  not bad  just mix it a little before eating  the service was okay  can't complain  food came out quick! i would definitely return for the dumplings  ahhhmazing!
great shanghainese!must gets soup dumplings (with the crab meat topping)scallion pancake with braised beefshanghainese style rice cakesshanghainese style udon stir frycold jellyfish appthe food is delicious  served super hot  and it all comes out within ten minutes yum 
the soup dumplings here are amazing and fresh! i also love their spicy cow stomach and beef scallion pancakes  this spot is a much better alternative to joe's shanghai  which is overrated and crowded 
this is a good place to go  and good location for parking   i love the soup dumplings    very very good
i have high expectations for restaurants like this because i've travelled around asia and have had very legit dumplings  being in flushing  the first thing i looked for is the rating from the health administration (at least this place got an a)   1 star because it seemed like every server had a death in the family 1 star for 2 different servers ignoring our orders 1 star for cash only 1 star for so so foodwhat's the raving reviews about? this place got nothing on places like din tai fung in taiwan  it also got nothing on some of the places in san francisco  not sure what the raving reviews are about  the dumpling is pocket full of msg filled oil that gets disgusting half and hr after you gobble 2 3 of them  +1 star for the pot stickers! these were legit and good  +  for the neutral pork chop soup noodles    bland  nothing too special! pork chop wasn't pre fried 
come here if you're looking for really solid asian food  walked in at 3 on a friday and it was pretty empty  we ordered the seafood & pork crunchy noodles  salt soy bean curd  you tiao (crispy dough)  xiao long bao  and pan fried pork buns  highly recommend the crunchy noodles  although it is a bit on the oily side  portion was huge though  the xiao long bao was also really delicious  the rest were good as well but the other two dishes were my favorite  service was nice and the waitress constantly refilled my tea  not too sure how this place will handle a busy night though  overall  really good food and would definitely come back when i get asian cravings again (so like tomorrow) 
love  love  love nan xiang!after being hangry for xiao long baos for daaays me and my friend decided that it was time for me to be fed these soft little pillows filled with goodness  nan xiang dumpling house seemed like a legit spot and i'm so glad that i was able to convince my friend that nan xiang was the one (and not joe's shanghai with the ridiculous waiting lines) started my morning with fried dough and fresh sweet soy milk followed by the delicious  super greasy  crispy beef scallion pancake  it could've ended there but there's no way you can leave this place without eating at least 1 xiao long bao i'm not joking when i tell you how delicious they are  thin skin  good seasoned meat and flavorful broth  we ended up with 3 steaming hot baskets  no regrets i'm so brainwashed by this experience that i even dreamt of laying on a bed of their xiao long baos (would probably be a bad idea in real life)  will definitely go back!
overrated! for those have not had real food  the service was horrible as well  mayb besides the soup dumplings the rest of other food are really bad 
five star for xiao long and xue cai rou si noodle!!!!!!! the most authentic place in ny for these 2 dishes so far  but 0 star for beef scallion pancake  not authentic and too oily  its existence is like a joke 
the best soup dumplings in nyc  maybe even america  perfectly crafted dumplings  tasty meat  and the soup is delicious  probably the closest thing you can get to authentic chinese taiwanese soup dumplings  a must go in the big apple 
i found out about this place from watching vice on youtube and eddie huang (is this a good or bad thing?)  the good thing is that  he raved about this place & its authenticity  the food looked so good that i had to search this out  and i've never had a shanghainese breakfast everything was so fresh and dirt cheap  i got the pork soup dumplings (they were out of crab & pork at the time (1pm on a weekday)  and a giant bowl of fresh soy milk (sweet) with a fried crueller  the waitstaff was very nice and helpful and recommended the sweet soy instead of salty with the crueller  the soy was very refreshing  not too grainy and not too   fermented heavy (like that blue bottled fresh soy drink)? i don't know how to describe the taste  it just had a good amount of liquid and soy ratio  stir the bottom to distribute the sugar! the crueller was alright  i've had lighter ones  this was slightly crunchier on the outside  maybe fried just slightly too long? soup dumplings were good  didn't use the vinegar too much  the soup inside had good flavor  i think i paid $8 total  i'd like to try their beef pancakes next time  a lot of people were eating the tofu skin soymilk and other stir fried dishes with a tofu or rice cake element  looked awesome i thought this place was going to be a hole in the wall  but everything is super clean  simple chairs and tables  it looks like they had taken over 2 spaces  with 2 separate dining rooms  the front doors are plastered with michelin reviews  the staff is very fluent in english  service is fast  there are a lot of people eating but everything is very casual 
very good xlb's   i would argue that it is better than joe shanghai in manhattan i like it even better than din tai fung in los angeles you can't beat $5 50 for 6 pieces   i wish i lived in flushing just for this place 
their xlb is the best in town  that is a fact  only reason why they received only 4 stars and not 5 full stars is because of the other food they serve  try not to get any of their noodles since they look like they have been drenched in oil for days    but other than that their xlb is great and they make it throughout the day so you know it is fresh  every single time i have been there  there is always a line so beware! make sure you carry cash with you because this place is cash only!
they have the best pork buns and hand made dumplings  the pan fried buns are slowly becoming my favor  no other place makes it like them  it gets pretty full so its better to go off peek hours  the service is okay 
spicy beef & tripe! that is a musttttttttttt! it is so good! and of course everything else  the pork soup dumplings they have are amazing  flavorful and extremely tasty  the skin to the soup in the dumpling are to die for and are cooked to perfection  def worth the hype  i've been to numerous xiao long bao places and this is the one i always go back to  there is quite a wait during the prime time hours  such as dinner after 7 and weekends are just crowded  the wait goes by pretty fast tho  trust me it is worth the wait  always come here with an empty stomach !overall rating food  11 10decor  5 10 eh not much decorpricing 8 10 came here with 6 people and the bill came out to 60  we were all stuffed too  service  9 10
fresh and good quality  the scallion pancake with beef was stellar  crunchy with the right amount of salt and sweetness  the soup dumplings are made fresh so it tends to come out last  save room for it  they're bigger than usual and comes 6 to an order compared to the typical 8  had the cabbage and pork noodle soup; big portion  yummy noodles and not overly salty  other shanghainese places always oversalt this dish will definitely come back to try their udon  sticky rice and soy bean milk!be prepared to wait  lines are out the door 
great buns  terrible service  i've been to this place a handful of times  the buns are always great   they definitely deserve all the critical acclaim they get because their buns are delicate  with proper thin dough and packed with broth  the rest of the menu is truly mediocre  i've had the jellyfish here and other offerings from the cold appetizer bar and there's just nothing special about any of the dishes  let's now talk about the service  it is nonexistent on good days and generally downright terrible  here's my experience  i came here on a sunday morning and ordered the pan fried buns  i know that this stuff takes time to cook and would be served dead last  however   45 minutes later  we were done with our meal and the buns still didn't show up! to add insult to injury  when i asked for the check and told my server to cancel the buns  the server didn't take the buns off my check!! i told the server it was unacceptable because i was in a rush and can't wait anymore for the buns and the server informed me that there was nothing she can do and the buns are now ready and so they will pack it to go for me  how crazy is that??? i ended up refusing to pay for the buns and offered to call the police  that was apparently the only way for the server and manager to take the buns off the check  how's that for epic service?
we only stopped in for after show dessert  coffee and cocktails but really enjoyed ourselves  lovely restaurant  adorable and friendly server! would go back 
this place used to be my fave soup dumpling place  although it is still great the chef or recipe mustve changed because it is not good as back then  back then the wrap used to be very thin  but wouldnt break  now its on the thicker side which im not a fan of  but either way def still a great experience and lots of good food  i wouldve given 5 since ive been coming here for a few years  but i can see and taste that it is not up to par as when i first came 
good place for dumplings and noodles  good is great and staff is friendly  the restaurant is always packed and service might be poor at times  not many options if you don't eat pork 
well if you're gonna call yourself a dumpling house  you better have some darn good ones!and they do  )  we were very happy to dig into some juicy soup dumplings  some nicely fluffy crispy scallion pancakes and a new crazy thing for us  beef wrapped in scallion pancakes   like a yummy chinese style beef wellington hahagreat cheap eats w  the usual service   get in  eat  pay  get out 
i've been coming here since the restaurant first opened  at that time  they made by far  the best xiao long bao in flushing  the skin of the buns were so thin and were filled to the brim with delicious soup  my #1 comfort food!since then  the dumplings have gotten smaller and the soup somehow i feel  is not as flavorful as it was before  the crab ones (my favorite) now contain only morsels of crab meat caviar with a hint of it's original taste   also  the service has also been consistently bad  service with a smile? that's unheard of here  sometimes i feel like the servers intentionally avoid looking in your direction if you need them to come to your table  they do have note worthy cold dishes that i order whenever i come  fu chi fei pian (in english sliced lung by the married couple! lol aka beef & beef offal)  marinated cucumbers  kao fu (baked spongy gluten with bamboo shitake mushrooms)  the scallion pancake w beef is delicious as well  a good soup dumpling place in flushing  but imo overhyped by the internet  i've had better ones in new world mall and at other smaller restaurants in the area 
as good as shanghai! allllmost as good as dtf in shanghai  actually   nan xiang xlb  1basketniu rou cong bing pancake  1orderyummmmmmmmm   thin skin  super unctuous filling  so  so much soup  and one satisfied customer who rolllled outa there  no line  no waiting at 0915!rob c  was dead on the ratio of pancake to actual marinated shank was a fail  huge! too doughy overall  plum sauce was great  but no with insufficient meat! $11total
soup dumplings  fried dumplings  soy milk  fried dough  fried pancake  spicy beef tripes   and the list goes on and on  they have pictures on their new menu now  so even if you don't know what the food is  you can now see the picture of the food in the menu  the place is pretty spacious (3 small stories combined)  but it can get pretty packed and have a long waiting line if you go there at the wrong time  they got a few micheline stars from different years for their place 
complete service failure  did not try their food but walked out after they said any food would take half an hour  if you want the dumplings how's shanghai on 37 ave is the place 
i've come here multiple times for the delicious soup dumplings and chow mein  it's extremely busy on weekends to the line where you can't even step foot in the store around the lunch rush hour but the food certainly makes up for it! the soup dumplings are a little pricier than joe's shanghai (around the corner) which is why i would recommend soup dumplings at that location but they are equally fresh over here! there are a variety of cold dishes that are very traditionally chinese in fact this is one of those restaurants where you need a chinese person to help you order the first time  forget chow mein and kung pao chicken  welcome and explore the world of soybean milk and youtiao  tofu bowl  red bean buns  cold spicy seaweed salad  and thinly sliced beef strips with tendons! the seating is very tight and sometimes you may have to share large tables with different families  but you definitely come hungry and will leave happy  some waiters are really cautious about tipping  my worry thought we had tipped a few dollars less and she ran back to our table in a angry frenzy because she didn't want to have been paid less  when she discovered that the dollar bills had been suck to the back of other bills  she shrunk away with her head down and apologized  after getting past the initial crowd and perhaps the delicacies in the menu  this place is a place to enjoy  i give four stars for great food  but the staff need to be more polite  come around and check in with the water supply  and for the overall crowded stressful ambience 
i love the veggie steam dumplings from this place!! and the kou fu with wood ears and stuff! food is as fresh as it gets  love it!
solid xiao long bao   plenty of pork and soup inside  they are served piping hot so be careful not to destroy your mouth  good texture to the dough  not too thick but it doesn't easily fall apart either  the fried dumplings weren't really too special  the exterior wasn't crispy  it was just thick  decent amount of filling  but the dough to pork ratio was higher than i would like  pan fried pork buns were not shanghai style (with soup inside)  they were essentially placed in a skillet to get the bottom somewhat crunchy  so don't expect shen jian bao  this spot is very popular so be prepared to wait  we went sunday at 1 00 and waited around 30 minutes  overall a good experience  ok (but not cheap) prices  fresh dumplings  and good service 
without a doubt their dumplings are one of the best  their fried noodles are good also  sticky rice though  is the worst ive ever eaten  the tiny fried dough in the middle with little bits of fried pork wrapped around with an abundant amount of rice  i literally had to use chopsticks to pick out the stuffing  and don't bother with the soy bean milk  they serve it room temperature when you order hot 
i like their xiaolongbao   they made it when you order it   those two ladies that made those are amazing   they just chatting and chatting while making our orders  however it came out perfectly fine     even number of folds with juices inside the dumplings   its like an art piece   beautiful (and they don't seems like taking much efffort when making those)   however  i only recommend their regular xiaolongbao but not the crab one  it doesn't worth the premium because the crab flavor was quite lacking   i admire their skills and the skins of the dumplings were amazing (so as the soup juice) but the meats were very blend average pork   at least its fresh though i also liked their steamed vegetable dumplings   their fillings were good and the folds were pretty too   spinach  rice noodles  tofu  eggs and more   naturally sweet their other dishes were pretty ordinary   however  this store beats the heck out of joe's shanghai   this is much more authentic   delicious  and cheaper   i highly recommending  to try this famous dumpling house in nyc 
was excited to try this place as we love soup dumplings and everyone said nan xiang is so much better than joe's  honestly  i don't get it  here the soup inside the dumplings is salty  but also quite thin and lacking in rich porky broth flavor   so if you like that style you may like it  but i prefer a richer soup inside  then there is the issue of the crab and pork meat  there were *a lot* of bits of crab shell in ours   this is totally unacceptable  the meat and the broth here seem to stay very separate which is less appealing to me  finally  the bathroom was really gross  perhaps this can be considered an irrelevant issue  but for me it says something about the whole place 
wow  pork and crab soup dumpling  pancake with beef   rice cakes and tripe were all amazing!
get the xlb  yes there might be a 15 20 min wait  but it is so worth iti don't understand when people write poor reviews for a steak house when they ordered seafood there  so don't make that mistake here  and not order the xiao long bao! the service here is typical of a delicious chinese restaurant    you will need to flag the waiters down and might be met with some cold stares   but when that steaming fresh xlb descends to your table  you will forget about it all  i absolutely love this place in shanghai and the flushing location lives up to the name  if you're here for breakfast  start off with soy milk (hot) and you tiao (fried doughnut?) while you wait for that xlb  it's the perfect chinese way to welcome the day 
love their soup dumpling and scallion pancake! very delicious and authentic  we also ordered sheng jian bao but the skin of the bun is just too thick for my liking  we went there during their lunch time and the restaurant was packed! we waited 15 minutes to be seated which is not bad at all despite how busy they were  our server was very friendly and patient  overall we enjoyed our time there!
3 5 starswith so many good reviews  i had to come & try their xiao long baos since i was in the area  the place was busy  the waitress was preoccupied  l didn't appreciate her throwing the menus onto the table  but i didn't care  like i said it was busy and i'm more willing to give service some slack when i'm in flushing or chinatown  we ordered the reg pork soup dumplings  as well as the ones with crab  we also tried the scallion pancakes  the dumplings had a ton of soup  it was flavorful  perhaps not as fatty as the ones in chinatown  i didn't think the dumplings skins were that thick  but i really haven't had too many xlb's in my life    at least they weren't doughy  perhaps they're thicker to hold all that soup? l preferred the crab ones while i liked the pork ones more  we never agree on anything    the scallion pancakes were crispy & airy  not something we usually order since they're so starchy; it was good  but a little bland  i think it needs more scallions  the place is really cheap  i'd come back if i was in the area again 
tastes really authentic  for the price you can't beat it  only downside it's crowded for lunch and dinner time  if you wanna peaceful environment  try avoid the hours 
the pork soup dumplings were delicious  they have great scallion pancakes too  i cant complain about service because everything came out fast  i also ordered the beef pepper noodle soup the noodles werent to my tasting i usually like my noodles al dente and the broth was a tiny bit bland 
this is literally my go to spot for soup dumplings  they have never failed me  it's very cheap and it tastes great 
this place never fails! their soup dumplings and scallion pancakes keep me coming back  this is cash only    that's the only downside for me  but overall such a great experience each time i go back!
the food is delicious   honestly sometimes the service could be mediocre but the food makes up for it lol   however unfortunately i heard recently the chef for the steamed dumplings which i believe is the hidden jewel of their menu has left so thats unfortunate   but regardless the place has great food specifically rice cakes  soup dumplings  and noodle soups   their scallion pancakes are also amazing
this is one of the best places to get xiao long bao      the items in the case are also very tasty     portions seem to get smaller every time i go    so they lost one star from  plus the service usually sucks    you have to ask over and over again for tea and water     if you go  go for the xiao long bao and not much else      
not sure what i can say about nan xiang that others haven't already said  my personal favorite dishes are the soup dumplings  udon  and scallion pancake with beef  yes i will order them all in one visit  and no i don't care that it's a carb feast  so worth it 
probably the best pork soup dumplings in flushing  a lot better and fresher compared to other restaurants  they're are busy from 11 to 2 almost every day  but its worth the wait!
came here for a quick bite before heading over to the us open grounds to avoid paying $10 for a hot dog  the quick bite turned into an hour long dinner  but i'm not complaining we were started with tea which was delicious! we then ordered scallion pancakes and steamed veggie dumplings for sides  both were good  i have to say i like the scallion pancakes a bit more (but being that they're fried that's probably why) entree i had the pork soup dumplings as my main course ($6 50 and filling!)  my party had various forms of noodle soup and they mentioned how the broth was amazing and tasty  perhaps next time i'm around main street i'll come back for some noodle soup! the only  1 star was for the slow and uneven service  we had to waive over someone to refill our waters and ask for more tea  also they brought 3 of the main dishes to the table and  i had to sit there wide eyed for my dumplings to come  to sum up  great food  even better price  great variety  cute decor but slow uneven service 
if you're looking for great chinese food in a clean authentic restaurant  look no further the staff is friendly and they provide quick service and they don't mess up on orders  the food was simply amazing  we ordered an assortment of different foods  including cold noodle with sesame sauce  dumplings in red hot oil  and scallion pancakes  everything was so warm and delicious (except for the cold noodle  of course)  i can't wait to go back and try their famous soup dumplings this place is really a great spot; small and quaint for dessert  try ten ren tea time around the corner on roosevelt ave between prince and main streets for great bubble tea!
soup dumplings!! love this place  )great food  great prices! i usually get an assortment of dumplings and wontons  everything is super tasty  don't forget to try the scallion pancakes!!
omg   this is literally the best pork soup dumplings in ny  you must try and joes shanghai aint got nothing on this place  the beef scallions  noodles  soy milk  donut curlers are a must try here  the place gets pretty packed since its small and cash only but totally worth it  i cannot wait to go back to this place in jan 
outstanding!!  my meal came within 10 mins after i sat down  hot & fresh!  parking is horrible around this place so if you can  catch in of the many forms of public transportation around the area!  this was the coldest nite of the year (9 degrees with real feel of  12 with wind) and i could've ordered dumplings from a local restaurant  i wanted authenticity & there was no substitute!  try this place!
still very decent xiaolong(tang)bao quality since starting to rival the flushing joe's shanghai  main gripe is that dumpling skins are thicker than i remember  maybe just my imagination   what hasn't changed? the long wait and rushed service  because  xiaolongbao 
my wife and i both love going to nyc   and every time we go to nyc  we always make a point to go to flushing to get some good cheap eats   this recent trip  we actually ended up staying in flushing for two nights   not only that  we stayed in a hotel pretty much across the street from nan xiang dumpling house our flight into nyc was delayed by more than four hours (we were coming from the west coast)   so by the time we got to flushing  it was close to 9 pm   after checking in  settling in  showering and all that  we were tired and hungry   my wife was already eyeing nan xiang and upon learning that they don't close until very late (i forgot whether it was 2 am or 3 am)  we were excited to go get a late dinner we ordered soup dumplings (of course)  pan fried dumplings  and wonton   everything was just delicious   i've learned long ago about these little soup dumplings that can really burn your lips mouth if you just bite into them   unfortunately  there were not many occasions where i actually get to eat these delicate dumplings   some places pre make and freeze them  or the skin is too easy to break  etc    these soup dumplings were great   nice spoonful of soup after a small bite to break its wrapper  drink the soup  add a little bit of gingerly sauce to the bun    just delicious 
thank god i don't live near this place  i would be here every day if so  the prices are the best i have seen  the food is so delicious  i always leave happier than when i got there  huge fan of chinese cuisine  sort of picky about it actually     this place is just the best 
hands down the best xlb (xiao long baos or soup dumplings) in flushing  nay in nyc  yes  there is a long wait for your order (it's made to order so be patient) and yes it's cash only (i mean really what establishment in flushing isn't?)  ad yes the waitstaff mostly have a permanent frown on their faces  who cares? you're here for the food (and the very reasonable prices)  the decor is nothing to write home about  the chairs aren't particularly comfortable  and there is pretty much no parking in the area  all that being said  i still make a trip out here every chance i get  7 train ride and all get yourself some bao  do it 
jersey needs one of these places right now!the lack of good chinese style breakfast in (north) jersey is going to make me praise this place for years to come i came on a weekday and this place was very busy a little after 12 noon  we actually sat down at the only empty table in the restaurant!we ordered a rice bun  two soy bean milk  dry noodles with soy sauce  and the soup dumplings  all of which were amazing! however  i will say my sticky rice bun was a little lacking in the ingredients side  ended up with a lot more rice left over than i would have preferred there's two locations for your convenience!bottom line cheap  good  fast  awesome  i don't put those words together often  but for nan xiang   i have to!
the dumplings were good  however  i ordered them to go and i had to wait 30+ minutes for one order of dumplings  i felt that was a little too long for one order of dumplings there are plently of other places in queens you can grab just as good of dumplings i would go back again but i'm not in a rush to hurry back 
the dumplings are great so are the other other plates such as their vegetable noodle soup  it's large enough to share with two people as well as other dishes  the only downside  which i've been able to put up with every time i eat here is the service  don't expect to get those extra plates  cups  water  etc  as soon as you ask  expect to ask twice or if it's in arm's length  reach over for one  either way  it doesn't seem like their worries are on customer service (i've been here enough times to realize that) but their food is consistently great 
came here from nj on a saturday morning  we beat the rush by getting there around 11 am  the service was pretty good  they give us hot tea  we ordered soymilk too  hot and cold  the hot is a pretty large portion  to start  we had the bean curd with cabbage and edamame  it was brought quickly  and we finished it all  we also had the scallion pancake   different than what i usually have  seemed fried where as most places it's pan fried  we also got shumai  not your typical shumai   came with rice inside! then  there was the spicy dumplings   skin was too thick  spicy sauce was also too thick  overall  not the best choice  also got the noodles  we got the xiao long boa of course  r and i both thought the skin was a little thick though  and supposedly the soup part is really tasty  i had three tries and failed at not losing the soup in all of them     ( needless to say  we were all full after this meal and departed with leftovers  all at a reasonable price for 3 people 
i was in flushing for my birthday wanting to eat dim sum  however  by the time i arrived in the area  dim sum was over  as i was looking through yelp  i remembered watching on youtube eddie huang eating at nan xiang  i found the address  and i was glad to come here on my birthday the last time i had soup dumplings was in la a couple years ago  the ones in la were a better  but nan xiang's were pretty good  i did not know what to order(in la  someone else ordered everything)  so i asked waitress  and she was very helpful  the table had pork dumplings and pork crab dumplings  both were good  but i liked the broth more in the pork crab ones  the other dishes were good as well  the shanghai noodles were really thick  but great  the scallion pancake with beef inside was really good  the sauce on the beef was liked by all  the only thing not really liked were the spicy wontons  they were not very spicy  and were in a peanut sauce  i am not a big fan of peanut sauce  so this turned me off overall  a good experience  the staff was friendly and the food was good  if you want good soup dumplings  don't head to the city  come down to flushing a give nan xiang a try 
mmm  soup dumplings  i could eat these from dusk to dawn and get fat(ter) and i would not be the least bit sorry  to sample their crab and pork soup dumpling is to enjoy one of the truly best dumplings in new york 
their xlb are amazing! full of fresh ingredients  their xlb are made from scratch while you wait  the customer service is polite  friendly and attentive  we also had scallion pancake and beef  one of my favorites  better than a hamburger! the cabbage and pork soup noodle was the perfect comfort food for our rainy  cold day  shredded chicken and rice cake is also one of my favorites  i love the mushrooms and veggies mixed in  this is one of my favorite lunch dinner places since it's both reasonably priced and you really get your money's worth!
been here 100 times  crab dumplings always excellent  cold beef and tripe always excellent  other stuff is pretty good nothing stands out 
whenever i think of soup dumpling  i will think of nan xiang   their cold dishes is very good  their scallion pancake is very good   majority food is good     i feel their service can be a little better  however can't expect too much from such an affordable restaurant 
sliced beef scallion pancakes     so damn good 
one of the most delicious and authentic shanghai restaurants i have ever been too   everything we ordered was delicious  and even though we were staying in manhattan we made the 1 2 hour trip to brooklyn twice! i recommend getting the shanghai dumplings (pork soup dumplings) and the noodles with scallion sauce!  we also tried their spicy beef and tendon & scallion pancake  both were equally delicious 
i came here absolutely excited  cash only  ordered the ff siomai ($2 95 for 4) which really isn't since it's purely sticky rice insidepork soup dumpling   tasted regularscallion pancake ($4 95 for 3)   good  but oilybeef and chili pepper noodles   okspicy beef and tripe cold appetizer   oksoda ($1 50)the restaurant is huge and service is efficient  although i probably will never go here again since i am not used to eating chinese without rice 
this is my go to xlb place   my wife said this is the best xlb you will ever find   she is from shanghai  and has tried them all   parking in this area is a bit crazy   and the parking lot between union st  and main st has gotten very expensive 
i'm probably a little biased in the review  because i ate at many of the best dumplings restaurants in taiwan   so  basically nothing can come close to the delicious dumplings restaurants in taiwan   i ate at nan xiang dumpling house maybe over 100 times  since my office likes to order lunch there   people go there to eat the xiao long bao which taste good compare to what's available in the neighborhood   a lot of times the skin will break and the soup will leak out  once the skin break and the soup come leaking out  it doesn't taste as good   the decor is very basis and the service is ok   if you're looking to eat some decent tasting xiao long bao  go to nan xiang 
where has a place like this been all my life??  it has everything i crave from taiwanese mandarin breakfasts and dim sum lunch   it has nian gao (stir fried rice cakes)  (a bit oily  but all the better)   perfectly done scallion pancakes  awesome sheng jian baos (pan fried pork buns) and most importantly  it has both sweet and salty fantuan (fan tuan       sorry  writing it in all variations so that someone who is searching for it can find it)   i have been searching for a good fantuan since i moved to new york five months ago   i still cannot find one in the chinatown in manhatttan   if anyone reads this review and knows where to get fantuan in manhattan  pleeeease message me!one star off because it doesn't take credit cards    (  service is also a bit spotty  but i don't care because they have all the carb foods i ever crave super cheap as well   too much food for three people + a take home bag = 12 dollars a person 
this place is awesome! the soup dumplings are magical! i've never had them before this place and it absolutely blew my mind knowing something this delicious existed! this place is a definitely a must try!
mediocre at best  it is not worth a grueling train ride     in the summer;  during rush hour;  with suspended express service unlike many places  nan xiang serves six soup dumplings instead of eight  while the dumplings themselves are decently sized  unfortunately i didn't find the meat or soup to be that flavorful  if you have to choose  the crab meat option trumps the pork only option  and whatever their reason for serving six  there are other places that serve eight which are made just as big or bigger i was also disappointed by the shanghai pan fried noodles  usually  it's served with a variety of meats and vegetables  such as shredded pork  shrimp  shitake mushrooms  and leafy greens  instead  i only found shredded pork and boy choy leaves  the noodles were hard and took effort to chew  while the noodles were flavorful and showed nice sear marks  the hardness was somewhat off putting but man  maybe my commute was so horrible  it ruined my experience  if you're thinking about going all the way out to flushing for this  you might end up feeling disappointed  and you'll surely never want to take the 7 train again 
used to be a really big fan of this place but started to decrease my liking of this place because of the wait  it grew so popular so every time i go  it's cramped and crowded  i usually come with a group of friends and the amount of food i order takes a long time to come  i really love their rice cake and soy milk  must visit when you stop by in flushing for breakfast!
price to hight  is not worth taste horrible look like you eat pastel with water totally not recommended  stay away  use less spend money for expenses food taste and smell look like food froze 6 months time employee talk launch and nit enjoy at all
in my opinion one of the top soup dumpling restaurants in the city  although there are 3 separate sections of seating there is always a minimum 10 minute wait when i come here  i'm a huge fan of the beef stew  and the regular soup dumpings  for $15 per person you'll be really full and satisfied 
five stars for amazingly delicious xiao long bao!!  both the soup and meat are tasty   you can watch the cooks prepare the dumplings as the kitchen is open to the dining area   actually  it doesn't look appetizing as they're working a huge mound of meat and i couldn't help but think about all the animals that were in it     but after i bit into my first xiao long bao  any thoughts of becoming a vegetarian fled my mind   they coming out streaming  fresh  and hot!  you have to be careful to not chow down the entire dumpling because you'll scald yourself or (more importantly) drop some soup   the store is nothing to look at and it takes about an hour to get here    but it's so worth it   highly recommend going here 
one of the greatest places in flushing queens  this was my virgin soup dumpling experience and it was awesome  parking is close and service is quick and friendly  i'd take a picture of the soup dumplings  but we ate them so fast we forgot to take a picture  also  get the scallion pancake beef sandwich  it is out of sight  great kid option for less adventurous kids 
my 4th 5 star review  this place specializes in xiao long bao (soup dumplings)  they are the best in the 5 boroughs and possibly in the united states  nan xiang is the district of shanghai  china where soup dumplings were made famous  having both of my parents being born and raised in shanghai and having spent a significant portion of my life there as well  i feel that i am an authority on these thin skinned purses of pork filled goodness  the testthe test of a great xiao long bao is being able to pick it up with your chopsticks by the tip and not have the translucent skin tear under the weight of itself and spilling the precious soup inside  this is easier said than done as the perfect xiao long bao must also have an extremely thin skin  almost like a wonton  that gradually thickens from bottom to top  needless to say  it is all in the dough  nan xiang passes this test with flying colors  every time the menuother than the xiao long bao  which is a must get  there are a variety of other small dishes on the menu  they are all done very well and the prices  needless to say  since it is flushing  are dirt cheap  my friends and i stuffed ourselves to the brink of nausea for about $32 dollars  including a 15 20% tip  there are about 6 dumplings that come in one basket for $6 and i can eat about 2 baskets worth before i feel like i am 90% pork fat the serviceit's flushing so the service is not the greatest by american standards  don't be afraid to yell at the waitstaff to come over  yelling across the room in a restaurant of this class is not considered rude in chinese culture  especially if you say please verdictyou already know what i'm going to say  i've had countless xiao long baos in my life and these are some of the best  anywhere  very lucky to have this place in town  i will definitely be coming back here and telling all my friends and family about it  the only drawback for me  at least  is that i live in midtown and this place is in queens so the commute is significant  for dumplings that are almost as good but not quite  my go to spot is shanghai cafe in manhattan chinatown  they have very good dumplings and are close by  but there is no doubt in my mind that the quality of nan xiang is superior 
if i could get a large helipad  tie this dumpling house to the bottom  lift it out of the never ever land that is flushing  and set it down right across from my apartment  i would take a blank check  sign it  and give it to whoever could make this dream possible   and then i would probably have to sell my soul or my roommate's soul for some money to eat here  but oh would i eat here nan xiang dumpling house represents everything that is quintessential in a classic shanghainese breakfast  comfort  quality  affordability  soup dumplings  fresh  tasty  juicy  these soup dumplings are some of the best around in the new york area  not too much dough but not thin to the point that touching it causes it to burst  scallion pancakes (add beef)  honestly  these are some of the best scallion pancakes i've ever had the pleasure of swallowing  nice and crunchy  not too thick  not to doughy  and with an addition of beef  it just takes these pancakes over the edge  definitely a must try soymilk w  fried curlers  i grew up eating this but i feel like i've never come across this entree in nyc  well  nan xiang has it  and they do it well  you can get the sweet version or the salty version or both but what you must not forget to add are the fried curlers  this is one of those comfort foods you eat and sip slowly amidst wonderful conversation  helps you take it slow  )appetizers  there are some small eats that you can order  i honestly can't remember the english names but if you walk to the back near the counter  you'll see a display where they draw from  there is spicy beef tripe which is a classic as well as a dish that has tofu  mushrooms  bamboo shoots  i just made it sound really stupid and bland but if you go  try it  you will not be disappointed when all is said and done  i don't think i've ever spent more than $15 here  and that's filling up on a lot of food  for the quality  you can't really beat the price  and that's good news cause now i can cut deals with people like buy my soul get my roommate's for free 
1  crab meat xiao long bao   very juicy soup dumplings  flavorful2  scallion pancakes   crispy  packed with scallion flavor  no soggy whatsoever3  shanghai style fried udon   a bit on the salty soy sauce side  but very addictive  must be msg  only explanation i can think of     =p (tea    more tea    )wait time on a weeknight  was about 6 10 minutes  not bad  but between serving people and takeout service  the place was very busy tea! i need more tea     
skin of soup dumpling a little thick  fried dough fritter was authentic  the pan fried bun also had a thick skin  overall a 3 star 
this place makes good food although their xiao long bao is not good  their cold dishes and qi cai hun tun are actually very good 
absolutely delish!!! the soup dumplings were so fresh  also had spicy tripe with beef  pancake with beef and shu mai  it was different than what i'm accustomed to  it had sticky rice with ground pork  all very good  i'll be back 
soup dumplings here delicious! best spot to go to for them!
it was great  i had it longgggggg time ago but never reviewed it  the dumpling was so tasty and juicy  it reminds me of my childhood  its a must try when you come to queens  ny 
great soup dumplings   the skin of the dumpling isn't very doughy but it's robust enough to hold the soup inside the dumpling until i get to it not explode in a mess the minute i pick it up scallion pancake is very good and my preggers friend was craving their salt sticky rice rolll and they actually had some available!  pretty good as well   washed it all down with some sweet soy bean milk and we were happy as pigs  )one thing i can't stand about this place is cash only!  come on now!!!
i'm just going to keep it real   they show preference to asian diners  they're never friendly  they rush you in and out  frankly though  when a place has awesome food  i'll take a certain level of abuse  this isn't a fancy place by any means   its greasy  probably bad for you  but seriously delicious  soup dumplings on point  scallion pancakes with beef on point  rice cake with beef on point  all my favorite things 
lunch for 4    $30 including tip this is ridiculous they also have some of the best soup dumplings in the city  while you might not think that i know my soup dumplings   i organized a dumpling dump (crawl    whatever)  a few years ago and sampled some of the best dumplings in the city i love nan xiang  it's great  the service is quick and it's soo cheap you just need to get to flushing to enjoy how delicious it really is 
love this place   please get some duck    get some soup dumplings and take me with you!! personally i find nan xiang's soup dumplings to be better than joe's shanghai  however  joe's shanghai has a more extensive menu  but seriously  if your looking to eat some good soup dumplings come here!! there rice cake noodles aren't as good as joe's tho  win some    you lose some 
disclaimer  i'm from california where we have the infamous taiwan international chain ding tai fung and i was lucky enough to live in the same city as ding tai fung  and was part of my weekly diet   the ny style xlb (xiao long bao)  just doesn't have the same appeal   the skin is too rough and thick   fine delicate thin xlb skin at dtf is amazing and these just don't compare   with that said  out of all ny xlb places  nan xiang is probably one of the best i've had   the xlb soup dumplings with pork & crab is the usual choice   it is juicy and filled with more soup   usually take a small bite to leak some of the soup out onto my spoon so you don't burn yourself from the piping hot soup 
i love this place  best soup dumplings i've had  not too fatty  good meat taste  although the skin was a bit thick this time around  hence the loss of a star  also tried some of their salty dou jiang this time and it was fabulous  the jellyfish was okay as many must have alluded to  be prepared to wait for a table  this place is super popular and there's a reason for it  be patient and you'll get a wonderful meal  the service and decor isn't bad for an asian place either  although they didn't put in our order for soup dumplings at first  meaning we had to wait another 10 15 minutes for them   
sat down and immediately served green tea  fast service  tons of women in dumpling are preparing the dumplings fast  place was packed  pan fried dumplings with port were delicious  we ordered the scallion beef pancake based on recommendations here  it was good  but very greasy  i could have skipped that  we go the  chicken soup  which was very flavorful  but had some bines  so be aware  the shumai steamed dumplings with rice and pork were delish   for two people we walked away stuff for $26 for dinner  it's no surprise this is the most popular place in the area  parking is tough  but the is a municipal lot nearby for $0 25 for 10 minutes and parking garages for $3 per hour 
i think this is a standard shanghainese cuisine place  i come for the soup dumplings  both the pork and the pork+crab ones  both nice and juicy with super thin skins  i'd definitely recommend their soup buns  i also get their do fu hua (tofu)  and it's pretty standard  their crispy scallion pancake with beef slices is also pretty standard  nice and crispy  but nothing special  i'm satisfied with the food here  but it's not exceptional  i'd definitely come back (already been here 2 3 times) for the soup dumplings though!
this is my to go place for soup dumplings in queens  during busy hours the line can get long but the place is deceptively big and the lines moves fast  soup dumplings come out piping hot making it almost worth it to burn your mouth biting into it as soon as it comes to your table  the prices are more than reasonable for the amount of food (and not to mention the taste!)  i wouldnt give the service there 5 stars but i can overlook it for the pork and crab xia long bao 
not worth the wait for a seat  go elsewhere for the soup dumplings!!! lately  their soup dumplings tasted awful  i heard rumor about their chef has left the restaurant   that would make sense  the skin on their soup dumplings were too thick that i couldn't finish eating it  the skin tasted like it can need some more cooking time  the soup and meat inside the dumpling did not taste good either  if were for the food on the menu are still good i would rate this a 1 star for soup dumplings 
shanghai noodles and dumplings make for a great weekend dinner!  my husband and i spent a july weekend in flushing sampling various restaurants   we were going to eat in at nan xiang  but decided to take it to go when the wait for a table was long (it was a saturday evening  so no surprises there!) we had the shangai noodles  scallion pancake with beef and an order of dumplings   all very tasty  though we wouldn't order the scallion pancake again   we would definitely order double the shanghai noodles   get there earlier in the day to get a seat or get takeout   we are looking to go back there soon as there aren't too many place to get dumplings (or shanghai noodles!) where we live 
the best soup dumpling in flushing! wish they have a bit more food choices 
very good  the soup dumplings are great and the shanghai pan fried udon noodles were good too  i felt very comfortable here and the service was good 
the xiao long baos were delicious! cooked when you order so guaranteed freshness  the menu is really short so what they do have on the menu are their specialties  the beef noodle soup portion was a bit small but i could live with that  i came for the xiao long bao and that itself deserves 5 stars  )
the soup dumplings are epic  the beef and scallion pancakes are bit salty but really good too 
food is great but wait service are not   man this lady was like snapping at me when i was ordering    sorry i can't speak chinese    a lot of my friends comes here  including fake winnie   yeah there was my friends doppelganger
love this place  has yummy soup dumplings  of course  but also very good taiwanese breakfast  i usually get the salted soy milk  cold spicy beef and tripe  a pancake with beef  and a thing of soup dumplings  cheap and yummy  gets a little crowded on weekend lunchtimes 
the food here is really tasty and service is quite speedy  everything i've had to eat here has thus far not disappointed  i would've gladly given the place 5 stars  but the waiters are not really a smiley bunch and feeling the warmth of the staff is important to me 
the best soup dumpling in flushing  and a whole lot more  they are not a one hit wonder like that other place couple blocks away  this place is always busy and with good reason  try it once  twice or as many times as you can  )
so delicious! the soups are great but so is the food  and price is just right  the place isn't too big so it can get crowded during lunch and dinner  but well worth the wait 
the best soupy pork dumplings in the entire new york city  it was flavorful  juicy  very very soupy and something to die for! and this is from a girl born and bred in shanghai  however  the soupy crab dumplings weren't as stellar  it wasn't as much crab meat and crab yolk as they would put in shanghai 
i am addicted to their soup dumplings! the melted fat is so tasty that i can't think clearly as i drink up the soup  the scallion pancakes are consistently crispy and the seafood noodles delicious  only negative is the potential wait times but that can't be helped if they're pumping out such yummy food 
for the value  this place gets an a+! i went for the pork dumplings and dang    you just can't go wrong with that next was the scallion pancake with beef which was probably super good    the barbeque sauce was a little rich for my taste though    otherwise i'd give this 5 stars all the way  the sauce is probably just my problem   be careful though    they don't take credit cards!
very traditional chinese food  i think  this store has good reputation as a real shanghai taste food  i tried dumplings and some fried rice with vegetables  dim sum is also a good choice for the customers who have never tried authentic chinese food 
came here last year and revisited the place again recently  they're quite consistent with their food  ordered the scallion pancake with beef  xiao long bao  and siu mai  the xiao long bao didn't taste as over seasoned as other shanghai dumpling restaurants  which i actually preferred  the scallion pancake with beef was too thick and had minimal beef  the siu mai here is filled with rice and no meat  quite different from the standard siu mai 
i love this place by the way   every time i come back to ny  i come here for some 小籠包，雪菜肉絲面，豆漿     yum
king's from queens from queens come kings   then of cause we eat on prince street    the soup dumplings your here for the soup dumpling!           help what no english menu  ok i wii point!                                                                                    next stop across the street a footsie massage  oh yea
soup dumplings are the real reason i went  i'd say that it's comparable to joe's  their scallion pancakes were quite good as well  most of their portions are a little small so i wasn't completely filled but it's a great place for a small meal 
so i worked from home today and decided to meet up with my friend to have lunch friend   do you want to go to nan xiang?  i want to try that place   i hear they have good xiao long bao me   egh that place isn't that good   so i drive to flushing not knowing exactly where we will eat me   hey i just found parking  where do you want to meet?friend   let's meet at sunway me   okay!as i am about to get to sunway friend   where do you want to eat?  want to go to joe's shanghai?me   i thought you wanted to have nan xiang cause you never tried it before friend   but you said it's not that good me   well i had it once and you never had it  so you should try it so i get in and get a table for us   we ordered the crab xiao long bao  pig ear in spicy sauce  scallion pancake with beef and spicy wonton dumpling we ate all of this and then   friend   joe's shanghai is better me   funny thing is that was the exact same first thing i said when i tried this place   this place is more expensive and the food isn't really much better then we ordered the pan fried noodles with beef   this was actually pretty good the service was much better today  they brought all of our food   but they don't know when to clear plates or refill tea   still need to work on this   also the food is really not that good   
i can't even begin to show my love for this place!! forget joe's shanghai! no  seriously  forget joe's (at least the one in flushing) cause they seem to have switched chefs and their food is quite awful now  nan xiang is definitely my go to for authentic  high quality shanghainese cuisine  and this is coming from a shanghainese girl who grew up eating this food  i've heard that the chef of nx actually worked at the famous eponymous soup dumpling restaurant in shanghai so he uses the same techniques they use in shanghai to hand make these dumplings  needless to say  you must try these or your life will never be complete  the shengjian bao (pan fried pork buns)  cold cucumber cilantro garlic dish  liang mian huang (crispy pan fried noodles    i recommend getting it with pork)  scallion pancakes  scallion noodles  and cold noodles are also delicious! in fact  try everything on the menu  it's shanghai dimsum style so everything is dirt cheap  there is a reason this place has so many stellar yelp reviews  if you're ever in flushing  you must must must give this place a try  (just remember to bring cash!)food  5 5    delicious!service  4 5    attentive  helpful  and welcoming  though with so many customers  they do need a bit of a nudge sometimesatmosphere  4 5    neat and appealing; there's lots and lots of seating though it still does get crowdedoverall  5 5    exceptional!
the soup dumplings were one of the better ones i've tried   also got the beef and chili pepper noodle soup  pretty good as well   really not sure about the cleanliness of this place as to the "grade pending" sign on the door but the food wasn't that bad for a late dinner   will be back for some more soup dumplings soon 
food is okay and the service isn't that great  ordered 3 crab soup dumplings and a beef scallion pancake and you would think they're hand making it cause it took about 45 to 55 minutes  currently this place has a "c" rating    the seating is horrible  i had a table for two at a six table setting and sat us next to another party  super awkward and there wasn't any space for me to eat also had pieces of crab shell in the crab dumplings
i have heard about this place enough times i had to try it  i got the steamed pork buns  salty sticky rice  shao mai  and dumplings in spicy chili and peanut sauce  all came up to about $19  i would definitely recommend the dumplings because they were big and tasted like heaven but not spicy  everything else was pretty mediocre  they're steamed pork buns had a really thick wrapper reminded me of joe's shanghai which are also terrible  overall everything i got was edible but the only thing worth traveling there for was the dumplings 
once upon a time  i was absolutely in love with this place  their dumplings were the best in the area  now  i feel the skin has gotten thicker and the meat has shrunk  also  competition pops up left and right in flushing  ultimately  i would still go back if i'm in the neighborhood and the mood strikes  otherwise i will stick to kung fu  which is walking distance for me 
you neeed this place   the beef and tripe dish is rediculous!  the crab and pork buns    daaaaammmnnn     i wanna bathe in that juice that squirts out (no homo)  )      go there!  tell em castro sent you 
food rating   4 5 starscourtesy of a foodie friend  dan h   he brought myself  bf  and another friend to this place to get soup dumplings   there was about a 15 to 20 minute wait before we sat down there were 4 of us  and we ordered the following family style 1) sweet soy bean milk (hot)   3 of us ordered this   yum!2) salty soy bean milk (hot)   my bf ordered this   he thought that it was lacking flavor (as compared to the ones that he gets in his hometown in california)   he wasn't too impressed with it  and stated that he would probably not get it again next time yelp com user_local_phot…3) pork & cabbage noodle soup   yum!yelp com user_local_phot…4) beef chili pepper noodle soup   yum!   tad bit salty and tad bit too much oil on top but still good!yelp com user_local_phot…5) beef wrapped in scallion pancake   i personally liked the crunch   bf stated that he would have preferred more scallions yelp com user_local_phot…6) salt sticky rice roll   good   as expectedyelp com user_local_phot…xiao long bao (soup dumplings) 7) steamed pork and crab meat buns   yum!   yelp com user_local_phot…8) steamed pork buns   yum!this place is very cheap   everything listed above came out to about $36!note   this place is also noted in the 2010 michelin guide   however  noted as the noodle house i would definitely return again  especially for the soup dumplings (steamed pork & crab meat buns)!
came here for soup dumplings  the service was crap  and the other foods were ok   i've certainly had better elsewhere  but the soup dumplings at least were fairly good   can't say much else about this place  if i come here  i guess i'll be ready for the lacking service and just order the soup dumplings
they have the best soup dumplings ever    be careful because they come out steaming hot  when you bite into them it is just full of goodness that fulfills every craving!soooo good!
so apparently this place is the spot to go to in queens for soup dumplings but i have to disagree  the place is dirty  found a hair in my noodle with scallion sauce dish  i asked for a glass of water and it had grease stains floating on top and grease stains on the entire table and utensils  they forgot to bring my friends order of fried pork buns and when we complained they brought the wrong dish and started making up excuses saying that their english is not too good  the food is alright but once you see how dirty the place is and find hairs in your dish  you simply can't enjoy it  we pretty much paid for crappy food and crappy service
first time at this restaurant   came here at 1pm on a weekday and it wasn't crowded  the restaurant has three sections   a little confusing when meeting people here  anyways  we ordered 2 crab soup dumplings   1 beef scallion pancake   1 spicy tendon  1 shanghai stir fried udon  1 salted soy bean& sticky rice and 1 noodle soup   all this for $52 with tips   not bad for the price and everything was tasty!  staff was friendly and attentive  restaurant looks clean  will definitely come back!
don't come here expecting your standard carry out fare  that's not what's on the menu at this delicious and more than affordable spot for delectable shanghai cuisine  we have been no fewer than six or seven times in the last year alone and constantly bring friends each time who've all loved it as much as we have  favorites include of course their namesake  the soup dumplings  beef scallion pancakes  pork and veggie wontons with spicy peanut sauce  shanghai udon fried noodles  crispy noodles with pork  beef and chili pepper soup  garlic cucumbers  and so forth  i've yet to be disappointed either in quality or price  service is perfunctory and direct but gets the job done  our favorite chinese restaurant hands down  so glad they've recently expanded! cash only so be prepared 
delicious soup dumplings and rice cakes but also try the shrimp dumplings in sour broth  very unique  nice clean restaurant with friendly service
not my favorite spot but def my top 3 dumpling spot  reasonable price and delicious  wish they spoke better english tho 
been hearing about this place non stop from all of my asian friends  so i decided to go there recently for some veggie dumplings  very non descript store front  in fact  i don't even think their sign is written in english (not surprising for flushing)  the only reason i knew it was nan xiang was because of some of the michelin posters taped to the windows of the restaurant  which were in english  went in  and it was definitely packed as i went in right around the peak lunch hour  decor was minimal and a bit tacky  there were people milling around the front desk  so it was hard to get up there to order take out once i did get to the front  though  it was pretty confusing  i asked  twice  about the difference between the hand made dumplings and the steamed veggie dumplings  hostess had no idea what the difference was  and only proceeded to tell me that they were "out" of the hand made dumplings  she later corrected herself and said that they don't have those in the restaurant anymore  okayyy  then why is it on your menu still?? in any case  i gave her my order for veggie dumplings and handed her my credit card  only to be told that they only accept cash  i then proceeded to wait over 15 minutes for 6 dumplings  not cool  not sure if it was because they were veggie dumplings  and hardly anyone probably orders them in flushing  but whatever the reason  it was a long wait for such a small order i finally went back to my office with dumplings in hand  they were pretty hot  and i could tell  fresh  but they oddly smelled of pork  not sure if i can ever trust restaurants in flushing to keep out all meat products in veggie dishes  but what the hey  dumplings were just ok  nothing to rave about  for $6  i was expecting a lot more especially from a place this hyped up  if you eat meat  this would probably be a good place  but no good for this vegetarian 
while helping a friend move out of the area one day i knew it would be a while before i had another chance to come back here  i called ahead of time to place an order for a couple dozen soup dumplings and pork buns and it took about 45 minutes for the order to be filled  while i waited in the restaurant it was nice to see the all the dumplings being made right in front of you    i'm torn between giving them 3 & 4 stars the dumplings were great(not the best i've had) and it took forever to get the order  all in all a solid dumpling spot  it's very popular so expect a wait to be seated  unfortunately i can't comment on too many other aspects of the restaurant since i only did take out  i would go back to dine in and experience some other dishes but for take out i might try a different spot 
their service isn't the best but it sure is fast  one like weekends or nights there's usually a long line so if you want to come here  try and beat the rush  they only accept cash only  and you definitely have to order the xiao long bao when you come here given this place is made for it 
10 30pm friday night = busy but no wait and quick service!+ pork and crab soup dumplings + jellyfish appetizer dish+ crispy noodle with shredded chicken+ iced sweetened soy milkthe soup dumplings lived up to their reviews  the jellyfish dish was cold and chewy  in a good way  the crispy noodle came covered in a lot of sauce but didn't taste that way  really enjoyed the food (and the soy milk)!  yum  definitely prefer this place over joe shanghai's!
i love the food here  we always get an order of each soup dumpling  an order of scallion pancakes and pork rice cake  yummy  the place is pretty fast paced but the food delivers  prefer it over joes shang hai
today was a non football afternoon  i did not know what to do  but i knew that some delicious food was in order  with my desires to try a new place and my list of bookmarks  nan xiang dumpling house was on top of my list it amazes me still to this day how one place is packed and the place next door  two tables only  nan xiang had about a 10 to 20 minute wait this afternoon and a constant flow of guests waiting on line crab & pork steam dumplingsafter reading reviews from yelp nation i was educated in the proper procedure in enjoying this wonderful dish  small bite  then slurp  slurp and enjoy  no longer will i be in pain from hot juices exploding in my mouth  the mixture was lite and soft in texture with a thin skin  it was delicious with lite flavors  i know that when i have a good dumpling i get that warm feeling of something good wontons in spicy saucei am not a big fan of peanut sauce  the menu said it was spicy  so  why not  it was a very light and creamy sauce with a small kick to it  the order came with 8 small wontons that held up to the sauce  it was a delicate taste with lots of flavor peppers with beef noodle soupsimple dish  but well executed  shredded beef with slice jalapeno peppers in a beef base broth with noodles  broth had flavor  but not over powered by spiciness  beef tender and peppers had the kick  the noodles gave it the texture and soften the spice of the peppers  nice dish cash only  no biggie since it is very cheap i can see why this place had a wait  lots of good food at a very cheap price point  i love food that is simple and executed right  what can i say  i am a cheap date        
great pork and shrimp dumplings  fast service and not crowded  broth in dumplings was rich and delightful 
be prepared to wait in line no matter what time you go but it is worth the wait  i stopped counting how many times we have been here  maybe 20+? the dumplings are worth the hype and earned all four of those michelin ratings they received  and i am sure it will not be their last michelin  but it's not just the dumplings  their spicy beef soup with noodles is to go "cracky" over  there is a part of me that can't wait for winter just so we can go here and get their soups; nothing like a perfectly  spicy hot soup on a cold winter day  as far as i am concerned  this is the best dumpling restaurant in flushing 
it was okay  but there's too many smokers inside and out  the food was okay  could've gone to a nearby bakery  the wait is okay  everything is okay 
i loved my crispy seafood noodles and soup dumplings  the dumplings come pretty hot; let them cool before taking a mouthful 
this is one of the popular restaurants for a long time! it had expanded from one store to three! my experience has been all pleasant until i saw something unexpected in my food  yes  inside my food! the servers just shook their head and left    since then i have not return    
i was sooo excited to try this place since i'm a soup dumpling addict and we made a special trip out to flushing for them  the flavor was there (ordered the pork and crab)  but alas the dough was too thick! not the thin and delicate ones that i was hoping for  maybe it was an off batch bc people who know soup dumplings have recommended this place to us   on the plus side there was plenty of soup in the dumplings  and they were pretty huge compared to what we are used to in la  it wasn't the mind blowing experience i was looking for  expectations possibly ran too high 
food was very good   highly recommended  make sure to try the lamb chops!
went for here for dinner based on all the positive reviews  the soup dumplings were really good  nice watching the staff prep dumplings  the udon seafood noodles were delicious as well  food came out fast! the only reason i'm giving this place 4 stars and not 5 is based on the fact that wait staff took my plate of noodles away from me before i was even finished eating it and no one checked up on us to see how everything was  it's also cash only so be sure to hit the atm before heading there 
the dumplings were great   very comparable to restaurants in the san gabriel valley (california)  we ended eating here two nights in a row (food was quite good and reasonable)   looking forward to our next visit to flushing 
their hot soy milk is delightfully lightly sweetened  the leek empanada has a crispy crust and juicy filling  but is a little salty  and their soup dumplings are tender and gushing with savory soup  on a thursday early morning  the wait staff was unusually chipper for a chinese restaurant 
soup dumplings  i love you  i've heard and seen so many good reviews about this place so when he said he was craving soup dumplings from nan xiang specifically  i was happy to comply  we arrived late saturday night and to my relief  there was no wait (we were starving!)  we ordered the pork and the crab dumplings  scallion pancake with sliced beef and noodles with scallion sauce  the pancakes came out first  it is basically  a sliced beef sandwich with hoisin sauce  similar to how you would eat peking duck  not the best scallion pancakes i've ever had  but it was still delicious  the noodles were next  it is listed under "noodle soup " so it wasn't quite what i expected because there was no soup to be had at all  but it had good flavor (especially after adding a bit of the hot oil that was provided) then  finally   the main event  dumplings! served piping hot  they were the stars of our meal  i've always preferred the pork version over the crab at joe's shanghai; i felt the same here as well  both are delicious though; i'd definitely say try it at least once  as we were eating  i saw that the table next to us had ordered dumplings that were coated in hot oil    ooh  what is that?! it's on my list of must try's for next time 
the first time is always special  amy s  and i were the two lucky lucky girls who got to take evan r 's first time (not once  but twice!)  because amy is the expert  she took the lead in instructing evan in placing the warm sack of meat known as the soup dumpling  he gently cradled the dumpling and gingerly bit into the thin skin  amy warned him of the warm juices that would overflow from the sack of meat and it quickly filled his mouth  his eyes widen slightly in fear because he didn't know what to do amy commanded  "swallow!"i don't know what it is  but there's always in inverse relationship between the height of an asian girl and bossiness  anyway  you should always do what amy s  demands  or there might be consequences        we ate other stuff too  but i can't remember them  maybe amy will shout the other dishes we had  garrett p  may or may not have been watching the entire time after the soup dumplings  we took evan for another asian experience involving balls  little black ones  he enjoyed it  very much 
it's all about the soup dumplings  better than all the others in new york  just the right amount of "soup"  just the right flavor  you get six to an order  and the only issue is how many orders to get  the scallion pancake with beef is excellent too 
having been dulled by the lackluster authentic chinese food living in manhattan  it's been hard for me to discern what is quality anymore  whenever my parents come into town to visit  i use them as a barometer as to what is authentic and good   considering they still live in the bay area with frequent trips to asia color me impressed when my parents gushed about how good the dumplings were here  both the regular pork and the the ones with crab were good but i always prefer the flavor packed crab option  and at $5 50 6 50 for 6  you just can't beat the price especially at this quality the pan fried pork buns are also good but these are the thick skinned bao like variety  my parents noted that this wasn't as good as the ones near our home in the bay  i wouldn't recommend the pork & vegetable wontons in spicy sauce  as the spicy sauce is composed mostly of a sesame seed paste flavor as opposed to the usual spicy sauce i prefer and have had before a good accompaniment to the dishes is a bowl of soy milk with crispy dough to dip in  i always get the sweet one but my dad prefers the salty one  both are worth trying but this is one of those divisive things that people will usually prefer one over the other lines can build fast in the morning so you might have to wait a bit but it is worth it 
this place is so good    one of the best soup dumplings spots in the nyc area  the service is a little iffy  but the food makes up for it 
first meal  after landing in nyc  ate the xiaolongbao by biting open a hole and pouring the black vinegar + sliced ginger vinegar inside with a tiny spoon  they were very well made  also ordered the stirfried rice cakes and a soybean dish  classics  simple and very good  hope to go back again!
the xiao lung bao is delicious  whether it's crab meat or pork you can't go wrong  the girlfriend likes it = i like it  it's reasonably priced as well 
there was a line going out the door  but definitely worth the wait  tasted exactly like the dim sum i've had in shanghai   the crab steamed buns are absolutely delicious 
this place is slamming  best soup dumpings in the 5 boroughs  enough said  i wish i can come here for breakfast  but i would have to wake up at 630am to get there at 8am  errr  first world problems 
if this place was just a little closer to manhattan    the soup dumplings are out of this world fantastic and so is the scallion pancake  it's super cheap which makes up for the pretty poor service 
this place was delicious   we ate until we just couldn't hold anymore  and they just kept coming by with more   abundance wasn't the word   delicious  reasonably priced (for the amount of food and beverage consumed)  and fantastic   a hidden gem in queens!
i love this place enough to make the 2 hour round trip out to flushing every month  the crispy noodles are well fried with tasty vegetables and meat accompanying it  but the standout here is the xiao long bao  the skin is on the thicker side  but it has a pleasant chewy texture and isn't just doughy  the filling is meaty and juicy  just bursting with flavor  the crab ones are especially good  and have that sweet seafood taste to them  they're definitely among the best i've had in my life (din tai fung being the other competitor)  the hot soybean milk + youtiao aren't bad either  and the scallion pancakes are pretty good  the only downside is that the restaurant sometimes gets really crowded and this results in food being slow coming out  and also having to elbow to elbow with strangers  still  the fantastic xlbs are worth the trouble 
food 3service 1 5ambiance 2o all 2i was so disappointed   i drove far and paid a boatload of tolls to taste the supposedly better chinese food in flushing   big fail   grade inflation here things to note 1  honestly  not that inexpensive especially considering portion sizes2  staff is terrible3  cramped  loud  and not too clean   but that is ok as one expects it for chinese4  a lot of items run out5  the soup dumplings are on par with area but fail compared to the bay area  and (of course) asia or ding tai fung6  municipal lot across the street is convenient7  cash only8  some food was bland
some of the best soup dumplings  red oil dumplings and fried rice cakes i have ever had   and for that price  it really can't be beat   it is almost always crowded there  but the staff are efficient  so it's usually a bearable wait   for the price and quality of the food though  it is worth it  even if it is cramped and service is subpar 
for many  dumplings are immediately praised as soul food   it's a staple that has been adopted and adapted by jewish southern italian chinese and other grandmas worldwide   but for me  doughy things that are usually steam soup based often simply taste like doughy things that have been too long steamed or boiled    i prefer tactile challenges  and punchy flavors    nothing mushy and boring and diffused in flavor but every once in a while  minds can be changed   this takes a bit of artisanal wizardry   the lovely ladies at nan xiang are such wizards   there's a core filling  such as pork or crab  melded into a patty worthy of it's own  separate consumption   this resides  like a yolk  inside a small measure of soup  which itself is suspended in a dough sack that's steamed to fertile perfection the challenge to all those present is to scoop up these steamy balls from the communal area and deliver them to your plate without spilling the precious liquid protein confluence   if you do it right  you earn the right to suck the whole thing down from an undersized spoon   but if you err  the seeds get spilled everywhere i might be wrong by alluding to possible testicular analogies  but china does have a billion people and the world's oldest cuisines     there are bound to be parallels they do serve a lot of other things besides dumplings  but this seems to be their signature dish   so grab a pair (or six) and simply enjoy the experience 
i finally visited nan xiang to checkout for myself the hype about their soup dumpling we ordered the soup dumpling and pan fried pork buns even before my buns touched the seat to feed our hunger we ordered a rice cake & pan fried u don as starters after we finished the two dishes the soup dumpling finally came out (30+ minutes) two of us ate +  rice cake with shredded chicken ($6 95)  tasty but greasy  the bottom of the plate was a pool of oil   rate 3 5  +  shanghai pan fried u don ($6 95)  tasty & salty  the small amount of shredded pork in the dish is almost nonexistent!  rate 3 5 +  pan fried pork buns ($5 50)  tasty & a good size  the bottom is nicely fried but the bun count is only 6 and costs considerably more than chinatown  manhattan  i'm accustomed to the 8 per order   rate 4 5 +  steamed pork buns (soup dumpling) ($5 50)  very good but only a count of 6  is it better than the best chinatown dumpling houses? no  it is about the same!  rate 4 5 total rating  3 5 5  note1  service is not the best i have experienced  the waiters are not too responsive; must be the language barrier!note2  if you live in queens go to nan xiang in flushing for your soup dumplings  if you live in the other boroughs it is not worth the long trip into flushing  you can get the same quality in chinatown  manhattan  save on travelling time and get bigger portions in manhattan 
i actually really liked the soup dumplings here a lot   fortunately when we got here  there weren't that many people   unfortunately we had an incompetent server we came here as a table of four with my bf's brother's wifey who spoke mandarin   i'm not sure what took so long but the table next to us came in later and definitely got their food first   we watched our server like a hawk  and i guess she pulled the short stick that day because all she was doing was refilling stuff   maybe she doesn't know how to bring food to a table because someone else gave us the food   she never checked on us until we asked someone else for the check   how rude   we joked about the soy milk since they had the sweet and salty   do you know what makes the soy milk salty?  yea  their crappy service and attitudes apparently   
made the trek from brooklyn to try their crab and pork  dumplings  they were ok  they were lighter and less flavorful that joe's shanghai in which my opion is a better deal  if you live in the flushing area then i would go but not worth the one hour train ride  didn't think too much of the shu mail
all of the michelin awards plastered all over the restaurant  gave me great hope  while i wasn't completely disappointed  i wasn't totally impressed  the dumplings were pretty good tonight (we had the pork and crab and the veggie dumplings)    but they weren't awesome (and  most came fused to the wooden steamer vessel   so when we used the tongs to pick them up  all of the lovely juices vomited out  we also had noodle soup (beef and pork chop)  the broth was great for both but overall  i would not go there for anything but the dumplings at the end of it all  i still left with the drying msg sensation in my mouth  so  good but not great 
one of the best xiao long bao place around! and best thing is they open earlier than other restaurant which offer xiao long bao  located close to the public parking space and also lirr train station 
i'd heard tons of good things about nan xiang  including that it can be considered even better than the din tai fung (chain from taiwan)  so i had to swing by and try it  on a weeknight  there was no wait and we were able to get seated right away  we ordered the steamed pork buns and the steamed pork & crab buns  along with the beef crispy noodles  xlb  not the best ever  i think the skin is a little too thick  xlb are supposed to be delicate  and these definitely were not  this is also nitpicky  but the meat to "space between the meat and skin" ratio is a little too much  i also could also barely taste the crab in the pork & crab xlbs    not worth the extra buck crispy noodles  your standard "dry" chow mein  it was good but nothing particularly different about it  overall  nan xiang is a decent place to come to for shanghainese cantonese  but i wasn't impressed 
really good chinese food! all of our food was great and the service was good  i would definitely recommend this place to others 
the best soup dumplings in flushing  the major difference between the dumplings from here and joes shanghai i find are these aren't as salty and taste much fresher  don't get me started on their cold appetizers  i can eat the spicy beef and tripe all day long and twice on sundays  i like the gluten appetizer as well  i'm not a  vegetarian but something about it i find very comforting  noodles can tend to be on the greasy side but i came to a chinese restaurant so it better be greasy as those are my expectations  who wants a dry ungreasie noodle anyways  scallion pancake with beef is the only thing i am not a big fan of  i find the pancake to have the right amount of drippy oil but too fluffy for my taste  i come here often and find the service to be what i expect for flushing  i love how when you sit down they ask you how many dumplings you want because let's not kid ourselves  that is the main reason for coming here 
excellent soup dumplings  the crab xlbs are very different from the regular nanxiang xlbs  i can't get enough of this stuff  20% of the time i've come here  the skin of the xlb adhered to the paper  which caused a small tear in the dumpling when you try to lift it up  the tear causes soup to spill out  which really sucks  but this doesn't happen often  still  worth it  just be gentle when picking the xlbs up 
i'd never had soup dumplings before visiting this place and it certainly satisfied my curiosity  the service was great  we arrived early  which was a good idea because a line had started to form when we left at 10 30 on a saturday  the scallion pancakes with beef are phenomenal  don't miss those 
this place is great! the soup dumplings are delicious  honestly  you need to try it  they even have homemade soymilk  this place is super authentic 
my favorite xiao long bao joint of all time! i'm rarely ever in the queens area for food   but when i am  you can find me here! they've extended their restaurant space so the wait for seats aren't too long   so don't fret! i always dread the search for a parking spot and wait for seats but it'll definitely be worth it!the broth in the soup dumplings are so damn delicious! so good with the vinegar ginger soy sauce  i can easily eat an entire order of these myself! along with the soup dumplings  i like to order the scallion pancake with the sliced beef  the rice cakes with pork and any of their soup noodle options 
one order of the pork xiao long bao comes in six  so you're going to want to order one order per person because like pringles "once you pop  you can't stop" and sharing these yummy dumplings may not be enough because they are tiny  each six had their own uniqueness to them 1) the first one was like connecting with all the hundred yelpers on here that say it is so good  agreed  it was so good  i been to joe shanghai but it was years ago and the taste forgotten  i don't think this was a reminder of it  just anewing  the first one was like testing the water to see the temperature  bit into it and some of the yummy broth dripped onto the plate  i quickly sucked up the remaining broth still left in the dumpling and giggled  quickly popped the rest in my mouth  darn good!2) the second one  i followed what i have read in other reviews  " just pop the whole thing in your mouth and bite on it"  like an explosion in my mouth  literally  it was steaming and the deliciously flavored broth just bursts mixing in with the soft and slightly chewy dough and the pork  one popped the broth gushing to the cheeks and caught me in the throat  what a simple yet mind and taste pleasing wonder 3) the third one didn't make it! like an over packed water balloon  the third one popped on me  i must have squeezed too hard because i was using chopsticks to push them onto the spoon  i'm like  oh no   it's like when you're eating ice cream and the scoop of ice cream accidentally rolls off on the ground  you really wanted to finish it though! darn  i pop the salvaged dough in my mouth  eat the pork separately and slurp the remaining broth from my plate  each one is so delicious  you can't even let one escape 4) as for the rest  i thought the texture of the dough was very good  very thin and soft  the dough had a light chewy texture but then it is smoothed out by the broth  the broth itself has a very light flavor to it but it is a natural made broth goodness and it packs a burst of yum  that in itself is a contradiction  a light flavored broth giving such great taste  like an ant carrying a hundred times it's own weight  the pork inside is very good as well  not meaty but a well flavored ground down chew that makes the whole combination of these dumplings awesome these are really fun and delicious to eat  i didn't like the vinegar sauce that came with it  it gave the dumplings a bad taste in my opinion  i would have preferred some sriracha chili sauce but then it might ruin the flavor  i think it's best on it's own  just like you don't need a1 sauce on a good steak  if i worked in the area  this would be lunch 4 days out of the week  i would give this place a 5 star rating but i am sure there are better out there  with a larger better dining area (though nan xiang tables are clean and comfortable)  the line was not too long on a saturday night  a twenty minutes wait but then eight people came right after  the wait period depends 
sunday with a party of 8 during peak lunch hours  pretty good experience we sat at the very front next to the door and in front of the window  besides the hungry people waiting in line and watching us eat  and the occasional draft of crisp air  we had a good time  i've never been a super fan of their soup dumplings  but i know everyone else loves them  the skin and broth are good  but i'm not as enthusiastic about the slight ginger (?) taste in the filling we also ordered scallion pancakes and shanghai pan fried udon  the noodles were okay   next time i'll try the nian gao  it looked really good compared to the udon they did separate checks for us  which many places refuse to do  they gave us the option without asking  considering the amount of people in the restaurant  we had good service  tea refills and food were timely  for soup dumpling enthusiasts  make sure to drop by and give them a try 
wow not really sure what the hype is  this place is really big and pretty busy  ordered the soup dumplings  fried dumplings and rice cake with shredded pork and preserved cabbage  the soup dumplings lack flavor  the fried dumpling skin was thick and doughy  and the rice cake was bland and has a tasteless veggie that was preserved cabbage  the only really great thing is the municipal lot right across the street 
known for the best xiao long bao (steamed soup dumplings) in nyc?well they aren't the best xlb's i've ever had but they're pretty good and much better than joe's shanghai in chinatown!!     (6 dumplings per order) the soup of the steamed pork dumplings wasn't too salty & the dumplings were bigger in size! the skin was thin (which is always a big bonus)    green onion pancakes  nice crispy outside but too much of a chewy mochi texture inside  i prefer mine with more flaky layers (ordered it with & without beef)    cold spicy beef & tendon  spicy & tasty    complimentary tea like any other chinese restaurant aroundcash only
this place has the best soup dumplings  they make them just enough soup inside so they are not too dry inside or overfilled  the soup inside is very tasty and runny not too thick  the dumplings never stick on the bamboo steamer which is the most important of all  if the dumpling stick  when pick it up from the bamboo steamer  it will break and soup will leak the only negative thing about this place is the staff are not too friendly and do not understand english well 
the dumplings here are really good if you eat it hot in store  try not to take it might become 3 stars when it's cold  i would definitely go back again 
after reading great reviews and hearing recommendations from co workers and friends  we had to try this dumpling house!we arrived sunday at 1 30pm   it was still very crowded   we waited about 15 20 minutes b c we only needed a table for 2   for a larger group  it probably would have been longer hooray for great prices and vegetarian options   however  i must say the meat ones are probably so much better  since it's the staple   *tear*  i feel my chinese roots crying we had crispy dough  $1 50salty rice roll (includes meat  pickled veggies  and crispy dough   we asked for no meat and they happily accomodated)  $2 50vegetable dumplings  $4 95 i thinkan enjoyable experience   affordable  friendly enough  fast service 
damn these dumplings are good  soup dumplings from scalding heaven  no wonder there is always a line   cheap and awesome  also their beef noodle soup was unreal 
okay  so i didn't realize that soup dumplings literally have soup inside the dumpling   i was pleasantly surprised to taste the burst of flavorful liquid when biting into a soup dumpling    unless of course you end of bursting the dumpling before it reaches your mouth   i can't help but wonder how these dumplings are made    i digress i checked out nan xiang for a late lunch with my visiting 9 year old sister  a foodie in the making   we ordered the pork soup dumplings (took me a while to find them on the menu as they are simply listed as dumplings)  the spicy beef and tripe and scallion pancakes the soup dumplings were tasty  but the highlight for me was the beef and tripe dish   my goodness!  served cold  perfectly textured tripe  delicious beef and the spicy was on point!  my little sister agreed it was good  but it was way too spicy for her to eat   so i enjoyed as much of it as i could  before decided to take the rest home for the next day's lunch   so good!  the scallion pancake was my little sister's favorite   it was so good we ordered another order  and also ended up taking most of that order home as well   the scallion pancake at nan xiang is definitely unlike others i've had   it was not as eggy as i expected  but it was more of a pastry   the texture was amazing and the flavor was just right  i would definitely go back to nan xiang  but i can't say i'd go out of my way just for the soup dumpling  but definitely for the spicy tripe and scallion pancake 
i come here a lot  and the food was sub par for a while  but it has been getting better  service is still bad  we ordered a soup halfway in our meal and they completely forgot about us
so i swore i wasn't going to go back to nan xiang dumpling house after the first time because i was not happy with the service  at all  i am used to brusk service  i live in chinatown! ha! anyways    the portion size seemed to have improved a bit  the first time i went here  i couldn't believe how tiny the fried tiny buns were  i was in shock how tiny they are! ha! i mean tiny buns are small but nan xiang had the tiniest of them all! this time they were more normal sized  i dont know what happened  and they listened to me when i asked the waitress to make it well done    she first looked at me with puzzlement    i said can you cook the fried tiny buns longer   i tried to even stretch out the word verbally and used my hands to demonstrate longer!! ha! hey it worked   it came out crunchier! yay! i didn't even take off my coat and i wanted to order asap because they are infamous for taking forever to get the food to you  thank goodness we ordered noodles too because the soup dumplings took forever  over an hour  what if we didn't have enough soup dumplings and wanted to order more after eating the first round of soup dumplings? then you would probably wait another 45 minutes to an hour for one steamer of soup dumplings  that is crazy  why do we have to wait so long when it was not crowded because it was way past lunch time by the time we were eating   i mean there were empty tables!  their soup dumplings which were smaller the first time i went here improved in size this time  thank goodness! maybe they had a different person making the first time? or unless they decided to make it bigger because i swore they were smaller  it pissed me off the first time  personally ordering multiple orders at once means the soup dumplings underneath the first bamboo steamer will get cold   i dont like cold soup dumpings  i like it piping hot  because nan xiang takes forever    it seems like you will have to know how many soup dumplings you want before you sit down    order right away!!!!!!!! if you wait until you read the menu and then order     forget it   it will be dying of starvation  trust me even if you order right away   it will be some time before you see the soup dumplings   you have to order other food    which sucks because all i wanted was soup dumplingsi wonder if i can call when i leave my place heading to nan xiang and say   hey i am coming to have your soup dumplings to stay in    can i order it now so when i get there    i wont have to wait long!!   \to me the soup dumplings at nan xiang are just as good as the other places i go to in manhattan chinatown  so unless i was in flushing anyways  i wouldn't go out of my way   it's just as good elsewhere  i can get brusk service that ignores me and takes forever anywhere else in chinatown!
the fish and cabbage soup is insanely good and i've never found it anywhere else  the soup dumplings are the best in nyc  what more can i say? have come here five or six times and have always had good food  good service and a super small tab  how often can you have four people eat a delicious meal at a michelin recommended restaurant for $28 00? the place is crowded  there's sometimes a line  the bathrooms are never clean  there's about as much atmosphere as there is at a motel 6 lobby  but the food is so good who cares! mmm mmm mmm!!!!this is the perfect food for a chilly day  so good  so inexpensive  and so satisfying!!!
nan xiang is a consistently solid restaurant serving some of the most popular shanghainese dishes  though not special enough to warrant a trek from manhattan to flushing for it alone  in terms of xiaolongbao  joe's shanghai is just as tasty and has more delicate skin  the sheng jian bao satisfied my craving but again was just good  not great  both were oversized compared to what i'm used to  so be prepared if you're coming with just one other person  the fuqi fei pian was excellent  even though nan xiang is a shanghainese restaurant  and uses big slices of beef and tripe  i could've eaten it all day  i've also tried their fan tuan  scallion pancakes  and cold soy milk before too  which were all decent  i would come here more if it weren't so far away 
ok let me join the great nan xiang vs joe shanghai xiao long bao (soup dumpling) debate  so after all these great reviews and all the hype over nan xiang's soup dumplings i had to come over and give it a try  i've tried a few times before but couldn't justify the wait time for something i knew i could get elsewhere  with much anticipation i bit into the dumpling and tasted what i expected to be soupy goodness  it was good  but wasn't great or nearly the best ever!  what are all these people talking about "cleaner" and "lighter" ?!?!?!?! i don't want my soup dumplings to taste "clean!" or "light!" i want them greasy and fatty!!!!!!!!  greasy and fatty means more taste! shanghai cafe in chinatown has pretty clean and light soup dumplings with a fluffier skin  i'd even say they were better than nan xiang  the scallion pancakes here weren't nearly as good as joe shanghai too  the pancake with beef was pretty disappointing too  maybe everyone's a health nut these days  but why are you getting soup dumplings to begin with?! i say go for greasy and fatty soup dumplings at joe's or eat kale  haha yes    i do have moderately high cholesterol    =(    haha
i'm not too sure what i can add to this place that hasn't already been said the dumplings are super flavorful   the beef scallion pancakes are really a stand out  other than that i really haven't had much from here  occasionally some chinese broccoli and some sort of meat over rice definitely my standard stop when i take a pilgrimage out to flushing every couple months 
had dumplings last night as well as their pork rolls  really cheap and fresh  the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because they only take cash 
for me i guess this place is good for breakfast cuz if u want to chill out with friends and have something special for the dinner their menu seems not much things u can order  their food is not bad and services is ok but somehow that place don't seem very clean for me
the place can accommodate quite a few people   on the weekends  it gets very crowded   the staff is adequate   the selection is quite substantial   all in all   very enjoyable 
seriously  everytime i eat here it's a great experience  "the meal isn't over when i'm full  it's over when i hate myself"
always a good place to have soup dumplings! there are cheaper places  but this place does it pretty damn good to have me coming back for more 
strengths here are the xlb  shanghai shao mai  and rice cakes  you tiao and dou jiang are acceptable  stick with the shanghainese dishes i guess other items are fried when they are typically done on a griddle such as the scallion pancakes and chives and egg bun  (but maybe you like them fried  no points off for personal preferences) felt the salty soy bean curd was actually too salty (someone out there is going to tell me to mix it all up)   and the salty sticky rice roll needed a little more flavor  beef one day in the scallion pancake roll was a little too chewy and probably need more slow cooking can you get better xlb at other food courts? maybe  is it nice to not have to fight for a seat at a food court when you are dining with more than two people? yep! how about a place open at 8 a m ? for all these reasons   not enough to knock nan xiang down to 3 star  (and i'm not going to be one to take them task for service either   had no real issues on my two visits this week) trying to visit on a sunday (or saturday?) and want to minimize your wait   getting there before noon helps even for us waiting for a table of 5 
came for a late night snack  originally planned to go to tasty & spicy down the street but they closed early (thank god they did because otherwise i may have eaten there without noticing not only the c health rating  but the bugs in the restaurant visible from outside the restaurant!! i'm not a clean freak  but really!?! ick) the atmosphere is comparable to a takeout restaurant or most chinatown joints  you get about the same kind of service you would at pizza hut  but at least you can look over and see two older chinese women slicing meat and hand stuffing the dumplings themselves  no gloves worn here   complementary tea is hot and tasty  i went for the veggie dumplings and the noodles with scallion sauce the dumplings were fresh and pretty darn good  i like the vinegar they use here  especially after i add a ton of red chili sauce to it  the vegetables are finely minced but it tastes like its got some sea veggies and mushrooms in there  veggie dumplings can tend to be a little bland  but the filling in these was flavorful  the noodles with scallion sauce tasted like a noodle version of my beloved sesame pancakes like the popular ones at prosperity dumpling in chinatown  basic egg noodles with sesame oil  soy sauce  black vinegar and sesame seeds  that's it  no protein or veggies  when the dish is first presented the sauce is in the bottom of the bowl and the plain noodles are lobbed on top  it certainly does not appear appetizing! don't fret  just mix the sauce in  i add copious qualities of red chili sauce and a little extra soy sauce to add some flavor and help pull the sometimes sticky noodles apart  this dish would be really good with some protein and veggies  but if you love noodles and the flavor of sesame  its a good call  mister brian c  got soup dumplings and a noodle soup  he finds the dumplings here unimpressive and overrated  on top of that they are more expensive than the ones in chinatown  he decided to give them another shot since we were in the neighborhood and i was hungry! i have a feeling he won't be back  and you can find him at chinatown at shanghai cafe instead he said the noodle soup was okay  not bad  but not amazing  i doubt he will be back 
came here on a tuesday morning  the waitresses are very busy and kept missing some orders bc no one writes anything down and customers are always shouting out more stuff  two diff waitresses brought us the same dish  and i asked for a straw 5 times before i got one  the soup dumplings are pretty good  and the soy drinks are really good  i had the cold soy drink  everyone else got the hot soy with salty stuff in them  the small dishes are good  like the spicy tripe and beef  the garlic cucumbers    green peas    and their fried crispy dough is yummmm recommend if you have patience
we've been here twice  most recently mid week for some soup dumplings   we ordered two sets of dumplings and some crispy noodles with beef   i am not an expert with soup dumplings  but i thought they were awesome   it helped that we were here mid week  had no wait and thus  the food came out pretty quickly   it also helped that the cost for these three dishes was under $20   hells yeah  i'll be coming back!
i loved this place   my friends and i ordered a lot of food  and everything was delicious   the soup dumplings were especially awesome!  if you want to find a place to get good  reasonably priced dim sum in flushing  i highly recommend this place!
as a shanghainese lived in shanghai for 18 years  the food they offer does not taste authentic shanghai style  i ordered xiaolongbao  it is juicy  but it is not the real taste of xiaolongbao  also ordered shanghai style pot sticker  that is also not good  the skin is too thick  inside is not juicy   
soupy dumplings are delicious! there is just something about scalding hot soup with pork wrapped inside a delicious wrapper that is very appealing  so appetizing that i'm willing to sustain the burnt tongue feeling the next day  this place definitely has solid pork soup dumplings! add in the vinegary sauce they serve them with and i am in sodium heaven! this place is cash only  like a number of other dumpling spots  finding an atm in the area can be a bit tricky  so bring cash before you head into flushing  the service was very pleasant  no one shouting overhead to relay orders  the atmosphere was nice  but a bit cramped  another thing i've come to expect at dumpling houses  however the wait time in between orders is what really pulls this review down  i love that the food is fresh  but i despise the idea of waiting 40 minutes for fried pork dumplings  typically my group will order 3 4 times depending on who still wants more of a particular item  i strongly suggest you put in a large order in the beginning  the wait between dumpling orders was about 30 40 minutes but if you're looking for a solid dumpling spot and don't want to travel into the city you should give this place a shot 
people always rave about flushing how they have the best chinese food  when you walk the streets something tells you it's a little over hyped  well  that's not necessarily true  enter the glass doors of nan xiang dumpling house for the finest xiao long bows (steamed soup dumplings) and get some of the cold appetizers such as the spicy beef and tripe  or the seaweed  bamboo shoots and mushrooms  these refreshing cold dishes are the perfect pairing with these hot juicy dumplings  you and your friends and loved ones can watch these soup dumplings being made from scratch as you enter the restaurant  towering stacks of bamboo steamers some empty waiting to be used  others filled and lined with cabbage leaves steaming xlb   they have the best servers too who are very attentive and quick  it is a kid friendly and kid cautious environment (they brought us the baby chair and situated her closer to the wall on the inside to minimize the risk of bringing hot food near the baby) will be back for more  shortly!
this is my favorite place to get soup dumplings  although from what i remember the regular pan fried dumplings are not greatwe usually order the scallion pancake  which is also very good  and the pan fried udon  which is just okay but filling
their soup dumplings  which i guess is what they're most famous for  are truly amazing   i also had their si xian kau fu (fried wheat gluten  served cold) and that was fantastic too   never had that before anywhere; it was a friend who ordered it   quite a trek to get there of course  if you live in manhattan or brooklyn  but i would highly recommend it as a trip worth taking 
if you want to eat at nan xiang dumpling house understand to take a train or expect to pay for parking in a lot  as there are no parking spots on the street  however the dumpling and scallion pancakes are quite exceptional  the scallion pancakes also come stuffed with bbq chinese pork  delicious  the service is excellent  not pushy but attentive  i would highly recommend it 
soup dumplings or as listed "steamed pork buns"they have a limited menu but really  i only come here for soup dumplings  other items that i've tried which were also tasty were the scallion pancakes and the chicken pan fried noodles  soup dumplings + pan fried noodles are a great combo however  i must say that shanghai cafe (mott st  chinatown) is still much better 
overall nan xiang is still one of my favorite place to get my soup dumpling  though at times their service is lousy and slow  it's due to the crowd  typical of all popular chinese restaurant and only care about good food 
their no frills menu reminds me of the offerings of the infamous taiwan restaurant that started it all  ding tai fong  but the flavors are by far dtf    however  in flushing  it is the best   the wait can look to be overwhelming but remember  chinese food is fast  so it's really not that bad   i would advise to come after 8 30pm if possible  no wait!scallion pancake is really thick here  too much dough if you ask me   i would definitely skip on this appetizer and just order the buns   they serve the standard chinese breakfast    soybean milk  fried cruller  steamed buns  sticky rice buns  etc    for those not in the know  this is to die for and a must try 
great crab xiao long baos along w  the beef roll scallion pancakes   this place is slowly growing on me!
traditional taiwanese food! definitely get the soup dumplings   the pork flavor and the pork and crab flavors were equally delicious  i would recommend getting the crispy noodles  but not the seafood flavor  the seafood crispy noodles is in a corn starchy sauce that is much too gooey and weights down on the crunch of the noodle i would also recommend getting the beef sandwich on a scallion pancake  you cannot go wrong!i was surprised at how tasty and light the vegetable noodle soup was 
one visit so far and the food was really good  soup dumplings were crazy good as was the rice pancake  price was very reasonable and the atmosphere was bright and lively 
the food here was really good  d i had the beef pancake and the vegetable dumplings~ they were really good! and the staff was friendly~ i would definitely go back  ) the restaurant is a little tight but theres just enough room to walk and there's lots of tables for other customers  ) i havent seen a line so i take that as a good sign because its packed but yet  no line! i think thats good service~
probably the best asian food i've had ever  if you are the only white person in the place  that usually means the food is authentic and delicious  yes  that was the case again with this spot  too bad we have to go the city for this and can't find anything in long island comparable 
i've read so many positive reviews about this place  and decided give it a try  have ordered vegan dumplings and fried noodle  i love dumplings  and this is definitely not the best place to eat them  may be for meat eaters quality is better  fried noodle drowned in oil and i have to search for vegetables on the bottom of my oily plate  so i just left it on the table  service is quick  as almost in all chinese dumpling houses  will i come back? nope 
best shao long bao ever  very juicy and full of flavor 
simple ambiance  the staff wasn't too friendly  one problem i had was that they did not serve water in any form  including tap water  this was a culture shock to me  (perhaps i'm not so cultured)  however  the soup dumplings were fantastic! soft  salty  rich  and the broth was velvety  the scallion pancakes were only mediocre  they needed a bit more scallion and less grease  if you're a fan of traditional soup dumplings  give it a try  but bring a source of water!
i don't think there's any more to say than the other yelpers you must get soup dumplings (recommended pork)  the meat is always over flowing with soup and meat  if you don't think the meat has enough flavor  the soy sauce with ginger can help  another favorite (and must for me) is scallion pancakes  i think any kind you get is good  but i always get with just the scallion  mmm    crunchy  fried goodness  and get any other dish  noodles  rice cake  or soup  they're all good  everything is goooood  lol the downsides are cash only  (sorry  credit card people  chinese people like cash) it will be crowded during weekends and regular meal times  since they have expanded  the wait on the weekends are not bad at all  waited 15 minutes for a table of 4 with people waiting at the door  of course there will be people who are hungry and are not patient and will leave (aka getting you a table faster)  (tip  try to be in a group of 4 and not 5  because it will be harder to get a table of 5  groups of 4 will go first  just saying)
everything was good  portions were generous except the beef scallion pancake and the porkchop noodles i ordered  scallion pancake were pretty oily  and had like 2 3 slices of beef inside the sesame pancake  porkchop came on a separate plate next to noodles  didnt really match tastewise  the porkchop tasted sweet but were oily  not deep fried but had the color   im confused!
don't understand why this restaurant got so high rating from most of the reviewers every time i visit flushing  i noticed this restaurant is always crowded and full  so i decided to try yesterday when i was nearby the food? not excellent  just average  most of the dishes we got are not hot  just warm  the waiter forgot one of our order  and he was was not happy when we decided to cancel it  the service? basically there is no service at all  the the waiter waitress only setup your table and brought your orders to your desk  that's it  then you are by your own  you need to ask when you have other need  and you might not get it will i visit another time? definitely not 
this really hit the spot today  walked for a long time to get there  had scallion pancakes  rice cakes with beef  and pan fried pork buns  scallion pancakes and pork buns were really good  but the beef rice cakes were great  good amount of kick  great flavor  will be back to try the soup dumplings as well  service was brisk but attentive 
there's really one reason why this place is michelin recommended    best crab pork soup dumplings! we just recently returned from a trip to taiwan and hong kong and haven't found anything close to this neighborhood favorite  the broth inside the soup is spot on  they do not skimp on the crab meat  the skin does not break when you pick it up  always made to order and steaming fresh!other yummy dishes we always get   beef scallion pancakes  sweet tofu pudding  salty tofu pudding (they use radishes and dried shrimp with some sauce  like a congee in pudding form)  kau fu appetizereverything else is just meh    we come for the soup dumplings prepare to wait  but it's totally worth it!
those garlic cucumbers are awesome  and the pork and crab dumpling are amazing
oh man! what can i say   the food here is simply delicious!  the hand drawn noodles are defintely something to order!
meh  i don't get the love people are spouting about this places xlb  were they good? yes  but ladies  gents my mind and my taste buds were not blown  i find the flavors to be pretty mild  okay  so i have din tai fung's crab xlb cemented in my brain as this deliciously oceany masterpiece swimming in my mouth that i just haven't found anything else that can compete  so in other words  get my ass to san fran(?) or go back to hk and shanghai to eat mind blowing xlb but  yes these are a bit more delicious than joe's  their chive and egg pocket thing was okay  but i found again  mild (okay i like strong flavors   so i'm just being hypercritical)  i liked their shanghai stirfried udon noodle though  simple  a bit oily but yummy  the pancake rolled with beef was another big hit (didn't taste it)  they have this beef noodle soup  again simple flavors  oh and their sweet soy bean drink is good  their salty one i found a little odd i'm still searching for decent xlb in the usa  gotta keep looking 
we bring guests from all over the world here for their soup dumplings and other dishes   simply the best soup dumplings you've ever had!  we've been through their two major expansions and are thrilled that the quality did not go downhill i was curious to see what the "complainers" had to say on yelp    so i scrolled all the way to the last page (page 24 out of 24)  as the first 23 pages were all fantastic reviews (which i agree with!)it seems the #1 complaint is service and wait time for food arrival   as for service  i've never had an issue (and i've been there when it's crazy busy and super slow)  so i don't know what the gripers are upset about    maybe it's them?  as for food arrival  order your dumplings as you're seated    they're all made fresh by hand for best quality!  yes  it will take 15 20 minutes  in the meantime  get some of their appetizers  such as their "smoked tofu  edamame bean and snow cabbage" salad    with a dash of hot sauce this stuff rocks and is pre made so you get it straight away!as for the numerous mentions of joe shanghai being faster  be sure you include your one hour plus wait time outside in the cold or rain on pell street for a far less superior product    one that's made in bulk for the tour buses of stupid  sheepish gwai lo who have no appreciation for asian cuisine nan xiang dumpling house rocks my world  and everyone we've ever taken requests to go back again and again!  it's worth the subway trip on the 7 train!hint for better service   speak mandarin or cantonese  or at least make an effort   it will be appreciated   if you've seen them when they are busy  it's obvious they don't need the non asian community support to be successful   you can always judge any ethnic cuisine restaurant by it's clientèle  if there aren't any ex pats there  what's that say?
with a line going outside the door on a thursday night  this place has to be worth it to wait for a table in the heart of flushing    and it certainly was  from the emotionless  straight to business  waitresses and their quick and efficient service to the inexpensive and fulfilling dishes they serve  this place is a great hit and it doesn't hurt to have an a on their health rating and to be michelin rated  must have dishes are the soup dumplings or xiao long bao which are tasty  full of soup inside  and fresh  only gripe is they only come with 6 buns instead of the traditional 8 served in many other places which leaves a table of 4 with 2 people with the short end of the stick on seconds the seafood rice cake has a great mix of filet white fish and shrimp mixed in their house seasoning that doesn't require you to put any more soy sauce for a bigger taste and their rice cakes are chewy and fulfilling their beef pan fried noodle is crunchy on the outside and smothered in gravy in the middle with your choice of beef  pork  or seafood (though i prefer the beef ) the highlight of the night was the beef pancake which has thin slices of beef wrapped in a fried piece of bread mixed with hoisin sauce  kinda reminded me of a peking duck wrap only with beef instead of duck  the bread was fresh  crunchy on the outside and hot and chewy on the inside all in all   this place is great for a quick  inexpensive meal or a place where you can go to pig out and order all the shanghainese comfort food you want and feel like a king or queen for a day without having to pay an arm and a leg when the bill arrives  always remember   put your name down and take a number as soon as you get there to limit the wait time! happy eating!
good but no where near the best  i'm beginning my great american dumpling search through new york and nan xiang was my first stop  the restaurant has an open and clean layout  it's much larger than it looks and has a glass plated area where you can watch the aunties mix together the dumpling innards  that's unfortunately where the positives end  based on the reviews (and many an article about the best dumplings in the area) i was sure this was set to be a momentous occasion  unfortunately nan xiang didn't hold up to its hype  we started out with a scallion pancake with beef  i'd never had one of these with meat in it so i was already weary of what was to come  what came out was your typical (doughy) scallion pancake doubled up between a slab of meat and dolloped with a generous amount of hoisin sauce  this was my own bad for asking whether my partner in food crime whether we should get the plain or the beef one since i already know that for this dish the original is probably the best way to go  lesson learned! i accidentally ordered the sweet soy bean milk (i meant to get the curd) but it served it's purpose nonetheless  cold  sweet  soy   ey and the perfect price ($1) next was the main event  what we'd all been waiting for  what reviews upon reviews stated was the best in the city  the xiao long bao (soup dumplings)  now look  i went to school in boston  not too far from the city's chinatown and there sits the bourdain acclaimed gourmet dumpling house  to say i was spoiled on impeccable soup and fried dumplings would be an understatement  because of this i'm always suspicious of other establishment's take on the dish (even in my own city  which hands down has better chinese food than boston)  we shared the 6pc and went to town  the dumplings weren't terrible by any means but they also didn't live up to the yelp hype as i wished they would have  whereas in my experience the soup portion of the soup dumpling is supposed to be a clear  flavorful  porky broth  i found the broth in these to be a bit on the fatty side  i was also devastated when i found my dumplings falling apart upon picking them up  the were adequate nonetheless  stalking other tables around us  we rounded out the meal with the cucumber with garlic  which gets all the awards for this visit  fresh  simple and coated with garlic (i didn't plan on kissing anyone afterwards so all was good)  these beauties were refreshing  tasty and gave me an idea of another way to prepare one of my favorite vegetables  i'd give nan xiang another chance (maybe it was an off day) but probably not before i discover what else the neighborhood holds for xlb  check them out for yourself 
terrible experience here  came to pick up a pan fried bun around 10 pm  waited almost twenty minutes so i went ask them for the status of my order  cashier came back told me i have to wait another ten minute because they are busy  but the place is not 5o% full  i will never be a patron for this kind of customer service 
this place has some days where the seasoning may be a little off  but when they get it right  this place is out of this world  great options on the menu  soup dumplings are stunning  and the place just has a great energy absolutely recommend
how have i lived without soup dumplings my entire life? 28 99 years and nada    what!? why!? to be truthful  i'd never even heard of them  (hangs head in shame) and then  our excursion to flushing  queens landed us at nan xiang  a small shop (but michelin approved  as evidenced by at least 12 stickers in the window)  but efficient and the wait moved quickly as we drooled over what we might order  yelp approved  too  i might add  verging on 400 reviews!? must be worth a stop  what i learned  1  cold gluten paste sounds like it might be disgusting  but it's actually really quite great  an excellent precursor to the soup dumpling main event  2  if you eat with jando s (queens cm)  he'll teach you how to make an origami chopstick pedestal out of the discarded wrapper  my life is forever changed  and my chopsticks will be treated as royalty from this point forward  3  soup dumplings are basically a miniature bowl of soup wrapped up in a dumpling  genius  to eat one  please see peter d's review  or take it from me  be careful  handle with care! these babies are so thin that one wrong move and you've wasted a dumpling  never to be brought back  don't pour one out for the homies  keep it for yourself  gingerly scoop one soup dumpling onto your spoon (or have someone help you)  nibble one hole out of the side  slurp the soup then consume the dumpling  waste not  want not! 4  we tried both the seafood and the pork varieties  i was equally fans of both  5  if you've not tried these  do  very palatable for even the unadventurous eater   and filling  to boot  an inexpensive meal  a wonderful friday lunch trying something new (to me)  go flushing 
this is our go to spot for soup dumplings (xlbs) over the years it has expanded from one store front to three  displacing the happy beef noodle  the long lines have subsided  but i have the sense the kitchen may not be up to making the volumes of xlbs to feed all the customers in the enlarged space  the soup dumplings are the usual pork and pork with crab variations  we go for one of each   they usually stay intact and don't break as you serve them  the shards of ginger were missing from our dipping sauce this  time the scallion pancake stuffed with beef makes a good starter  crisp and tasty  it serves three  the cold appetizers are delicious  we went for spicy tofu and braised beef with tripe on the most recent visit  as our first choices  the chicken and braised fish were out of stock at about 5 p m  an order of rice cakes with seafood completed our dinner for three  which ran $50 with tip  credit cards are not accepted  so bring cash and enjoy 
great customer service   always fresh dumplings   be careful because they are hot!  the veggie soup is a good choice too if you are trying to be healthy    this place is within walking distance from main street near the 7 train 
waitress here r bad shape  i lost my sunglasses there  and they steal it   what a bad restaurant  ethic is most important thing  if you get bad employee  will ruin ur business 
i wanted to save my first ever yelp review for some place really special but i'm not doing anyone any favors by waiting for that picture perfect moment there are a handful of places to get xiao long bao (or soup dumplings for those less asian inclined) in flushing  but nan xiang is  in my opinion  unequivocally the best and only place to indulge in the little pockets of meat and soup  all of their food is authentically shanghainese and i have yet to be disappointed in a dish their service is what you would expect of any $ chinese restaurant  so don't be surprised if you have to repeat your order twice (maybe three times)  or vigorously wave your arms to catch the attention of one of the lackluster waiters waitresseshighlights   xiao long bao  both the regular and crab meat ones will cause your taste buds to explode  figuratively and physically (because they're hot)  i wanted to take pictures but the last thing you want to do is let these bad boys get cold so   sorry for being selfish  each order comes with 6  and i think 4 is enough to satisfy one person (if you're ordering other food as well) so bear that in mind   wonton with chili oil and peanut sauce and soy sauce  i just made that name up  but i think it's self explanatory  this is my new favorite thing to eat   wontons are cooked al dente  if there's such a thing for wontons  and the sauce is on point   rice cakes with shredded pork  a family favorite  strong wok flavor  ample sauce  just all in all a solid dish    kao fu  this is a sweet and savory  marinated tofu appetizer  my brother preaches that this is the best kao fu in america  and to be honest  i have not had better i think it speaks for itself that even with multiple other restaurants making xlb  even with two expansions  even with a c health rating  there is still a line to get in here on the weekends tldr; go here if you're looking for relatively cheap  authentic shanghainese food that has not yet succumbed to americanization (lookin' at you joe's shanghai) 
bottom line   this place does not disappoint  if all you know is din tai fung or joe's shanghai  then you need to redeem yourself and come here came on saturday  29 oct 2011 with 3 friends and there wasn't a wait around 6pm  probably due to the slush on the ground  chilling wind and rain coming down   we ordered the following sweet soy bean milk ($1 00 x2)   it was nice and hot! would order again scallion pancake with sliced beef ($3 95 x2)   this was so tasty! the beef was wrapped inside the scallion pancake  and some hoisin sauce was used on the inside  turnip puff ($3 50)   one order of this was good for us   i didn't particularly like it because it was a bit greasy  but my friends loved it steamed pork buns shanghai dumplings ($5 50) this was pretty tasty  but the crab pork was better tasting steamed crab & pork buns (shanghai dumplings w  crab) ($6 50 x2)   this was so good  the juice inside was really nice  i'd order it again and again our bill came to $31 90 + 2 83 tax + 8 00 tip = $42 73 for the 4 of us    such a cheap meal!
there's always a long line here  that's because they have the best soup dumplings! i can eat a whole order to myself! the shanghai pan fried noodles are awesome and so are the rice cakes  for cold appetizers i like the garlic cucumbers  this place never disappoints  just be prepared to wait at least 15 minutes especially on weekends  also if you are driving  it's not the best area for parking  if you're familiar with flushing you already know that  service isn't the best but these aren't the type of places you come for service  these are the places that you come for good and cheap food  also they don't take credit so make sure to bring cash 
amazing experience  worth the wait  glad we dropped by
i used to rate this place 4  but now 3 due to recent experience this is a great shanghainese breakfast place which is served all day long   get ready to wait for a while and also prepare your thick face since their host or hostess will always give you an attitude and make you move around in the limited space they have while waiting it is kind of cool that you can watch all these ladies making the xiao long baos and dumplings in the open kitchen while you wait  scan their cold dish station and pick what you want   the spicy tendon and drunked chicken i thought were quite decent to much on while you wait for your xiao long baos salty beancurd soup   yummo!  an acquired taste and completely unexpected since i typically eat it sweet  but once i tried it  i had to always get it (well  for $2 why not) everytime i am there the xiao long baos are great as well though i have to say that it is not quite joe shanghai's   get the one with crab on top noodles   shanghainese noodle is pretty standard and fills you up for sure beef rolls   basically scallion pancakes with beef and hoisin sauce inside   i love it!!don't expect much on service   be happy when they don't give you the look when you ask for tea or water 
the specialty here is the soup dumplings or xiao lung bao  the service is quick and non migraine full!  this place is probably the best restaurant to order soup dumplings in queens  possibly nyc! i would recommend their pork chop noodle soup and kao fu  which is braised wheat gluten with mushrooms  it is not really on the expensive side but neither is it cheap  in the end  it's all worth it  the only downside is the sanitation of the restaurant  it isn't 100% but it is made up for with the great food 
general consensus is right on the money here   xlb are less fatty soup and still great compared to joe's so it really just depends on what you want if you get the scallion pancakes  i'd skip the version with beef   if you want meat get another dish the cold appetizers at nan xiang are the bomb  as are all the noodle dishes   we tried the bean curd with peas and the seafood crispy noodles  both of which i recommend   i just wish we'd gone with a larger group so we could try more  but it means i'll just have to go back 
great spot to visit for soup dumplings  beef scallion pancakes with hiosin! bam!! delicious  we also sampled the udon noodles  pork and crab soup dumplings  mai shen   the price was so reasonable and fed 3  there is tons of seating  but still expect to wait as this is a known spot for the locals  service was lacking but i can't discredit as the place was great  be back soon  )
after watching a vice video with eddie huang  i decided to stop by and take a look  the soup dumplings are subpar  they're tasty but they're not mind blowing  prices are pretty good if you're not trying to spend a lot  this place does have a lot of taiwanese appetizers so that was pretty cute  it's as if someone took the treats and snacks from taiwanese night markets and created a little sit down restaurant in new york  brings back some good memories!
i have been in new york 5 6 years   i go to flushing weekly to satisfy my chinese food cravings    for 5 years i avoided this place because of the queue out front   but yesterday i happened to be in flushing at 4pm and figured there was no wait   so finally got to try this place and boy should i have stopped by earlier let me just say that i have had a lot of xiao long baos in taiwan  shanghai  hong kong  new york  and the 25+ years i lived in southern california   i get joe's shanghai at least once a week just because it is close to my work in manhattan   last night i ordered both the pork and crab xiao long baos and the pork one was the best i've had in the new york area   if mei long village in la gets a 10 10 and din tai fung gets a 9 10   i would say these are about a 7 5 10   joes shanghai would be maybe a 6 10 their crab soup dumpling on the other hand was very dissapointing   my wife thought i didn't even order crab soup dumplings because you couldnt taste it   they need to add more of the orange part of the crab to get the crab punch   in addition to the soup dumplings i also got the scallion beef roll   although tasty  the scallion pancake was too thick   i would've preferred a thinner pancake   i will definetely be back to try their other  dishes 
this place beats joe's shanghai anytime ! i don't like to do comparison however  with this place  i would make a exception  this place is truly the real place for dumpling soup! try both the crab and the pork  don't limit yourself down to one type! trust me! you will thank me later! if you come here for lunch  they also have fresh made soy milk !!! you can ask them to add sugar in it if you want  they also make really good rice cake  i think i got the seafood one last time ! tips  very easy to travel to  there's a parking lot right across the street  next to the bus stop and the 7th train  the soup dumplings might get messy  so be careful when you eat them  try everything  no point to wait till next time  
i've been here twice  and it never disappointed  it gets uber crowded here  there's always a line  always get the crab & pork soup dumplings  beef & scallion pancakes  and they got soy milk (sweet  salty  hot  cold  whatever you want)  better than joe's shanghai 
i come here often & normally order the cold dishes (see pic)  the beef pancake is sooo good  their soup dumplings are always a hit! love this place 
i liked the dumplings but i wouldn't say i loved it that much  long lines and not the best service in town   the workers and owners are mainlanders looking to suck your money 
good soup dumplings  but not as good as i had hoped based on the yelp reviews  and not as cheap as i would have expected from a place like this in flushing waited about 20 minutes for a table for two   it's a bit of a mad house  with people standing in and around areas where people are dining   people waiting are talking loudly with each other in chinese to drown out the above average noise from the diners in the restaurant   old chinese guy backed his thang up into my crotch area and made contact with his butt   sure  these things happen in crowded places  but was a bit uncomfortable when he just stayed there    and stayed there  until i moved away from him   i'll gladly lose to him in a game of crotch chicken soup dumplings were good overall  but they were falling apart when we went to get the last ones from the wood crate things they serve it in   so it wasn't a soup dumpling anymore   just a dumpling   was a bit disappointed with that ordered some other dishes  which i forgot   i don't recall what they were  but they were fairly average   it seems this place is known for the soup dumplings and everything else is just accompaniments 
one of the rare times i go down as far as flushing!  got there around noon on black friday and there was a huge wait outside   i believe we waited close to 40 minutes for our table   once inside  it was nice and toasty and we got quick and friendly service   ordered their xiaolong bao and was told we'd have to wait another 40 minutes before those were ready   omggg lol   sooo hungry at this point so we ordered a bunch of other things to off set our hunger   the best thing on the menu is definitely their green onion pancake with beef   not your typical beef roll   this was marinated beef inbetween two mochi consistency onion pancakes  so good   everyone should make it this way   the xiaolong bao was nice and hot because it was made fresh with plenty of delicious soup  but the wrapper is a little thick for my liking   overall  a great place!
this place was awesome  as evidenced by the dozens of people waiting for a table  we got lucky and were seated right away  ordered the xiao long bao  the fried dumplings  scallion pancake and pan fried shanghai noodles  and they were all delicious  more than enough food for two people!
had the beef and chili pepper noodle soup  it was very good and is enough to fill most any appetite  could have had a little better beef to noodle ration but the spicy broth had a great flavor  the prices and service are exceptional  i will return!!!!
came in friday night  finding parking was like a game of musical chairs  this place was packed  but got seated pretty fast thankfully  to start we ordered  a cold dish  the cucumber cilantro and garlic salad  it was really good  then had the scallion pancake with beef  it was ok  couldn't finish it cause it was very greasy  then we ordered what we actually came for  the pork soup dumplings  they were good  but honestly i prefer the ones at joes shanghai because they are more flavorful and seem fresher  when you bite into them you actually feel the savory delicious broth  the ones at this place aren't as good 
their steamed pork buns are the best  and i also love their shanghai u don  it's a great choice to make if you come for the first time  but service is a bit slow on a busy sunday 
excellent soupy buns  noodles are delicious   appetizers are tasty  enough said   go and enjoy 
the night before i was thinking of having soup dumpling  i've been here a number of time and they are consistantly 4 5 stars  note  their soup dumplings are freshly made as you order   this place is your tipical very casual place  if you get here by 8 45 am you can park across the street in the municipal parking lot  by 9 00 am it's pretty hard to park   also the restaurant was already 3 4 full in both rooms at 8 45 am   anyway  we ordered two soup dumpling (xiao long bao) which came out piping hot and the soup was nice and warm   the meat was nicely flavored and semi firm  it came 6 per order  $6 25  next we had their scallion pancake ($3 50)  which also came out freshly made  nice and very warm   it was good but needed a little more seasoning but still delicious   we also ordered their shanghai pan fried udon ($6 95) which was good but the order was small (enough for 1 person)   if you're looking for the best shanghai pan fried noodle go to joe's shanghai rest    our brunch for two was $25 plus tip  super  super  super!
the shanghainese food here is pretty good  i wouldn't say it's four or five stars great  but i consider it a staple go to place for shanghainese food  the food was served quickly and the service is fair  as you would expect from a legit chinese restaurant  the xiao long bao (soup dumplings) is good and would at least  meet your expectations  we also had some of their other stir fry dishes and definitely did not disappoint like some places in chinatown  i'd pick this place over the other shanghai eateries in the area 
i love the soup dumplings here better than joes    the soup within the dumpling is a bit more sweeter from a vegetable broth while joes is a bit more salty and fattier   the dumpling sauce wasn't as vinegary here as well   i gave a 3 star for that i couldn't order anything from the grill because some guy ordered 20 orders for takeout at the grill and they couldn't manage it also   there were crab shells in the crab & pork soup dumplings     me and my gf had several of those  she also pointed out that i had some winged insect creature caked onto one of my dumpling    glad she saw it before i ate it    (it was so good   that i just pinched it off and ate the rest of the dumpling)   
delicious restaurant with great dumplings but a downside  we gave them over 15 percent tip and they asked us for more 
came here after the us open because heard lots of rave about it  thought it was just above average   nothing that amazing that i would take a two hours train ride to go to queens  flushing to eat   if in the area  definitely come by here to eat   but if not  tons of shanghai dumplings places in chinatown in manhattan that are as yummy!
great soup dumplings and way less greasy than joe's shanghai  things to try  regular pork soup dumplings  beef scallion pancake and shanghai noodles  quick precaution  it will be extremely crowded on weekends and friday nights but it's worth the wait!
the food is great  but if you want ambiance  go to the newer spot next to starbucks called bang  same owner  same food  slightly higher prices though  this location is in a semi underground shopping bazaar  the place smells of at least six different shops all at once  the food is amazing  and looking at the wall    many to chefs and critics have visited and posted reviews as well  you must try it!
the soup dumplings at nan xiang are one of the best i've had  they are definitely better than joe shanghai (joe shanghai is all hype imo)  i love the soup dumplings at nan xiang because they don't have that nauseating pork smell that most soup dumpling restaurants can't seem to get rid of and that is a big big plus to me  i also always order the rice cake with beef but the scallion pancakes are so so  theyre too doughy for me  try an iced sweet soy milk before you leave! fyi  parking here is a nightmare and the service is honestly not great but i can't find any other place that makes soup dumplings like nan xiang 
best soup dumpling in nyc  hands down  joe's shanghai and other places simply do not measure up  this place has gotten so popular that they have expanded to acquire both the stores to their right and left  despite growing  they have kept up the quality of the  soup dumplings soup dumplings  there are two fillings available  pork only and pork+crab meat  get the pork + crab meat  it is heavenly  the broth is a porky  but has a more savory flavor without being fishy  the soup is piping hot  yellow in color from the crab  the skin does not stick to the napa used in the bamboo steamer unless it gets too cold  they give you a ginger and brown vinegar sauce  which is good with the meat and skin  but can overpower the soup   the cold dishes  the cold dishes they have out under that cafeteria styled server are awesome  they are all good  they will put two on the same plate  so you can try more variety  even my non asian friends love the tripe and tendon  the gluten dish is also a favorite  others  the soy milk (i like the sweet cold one)  noodle soups and dishes are good  but when i go  i want a ton of the cold dishes and the pork crab soup dumplings and a cold soy milk  it is worth the trek out to flushing  also  cash only and expect a wait with large groups  it's a chinese restaurant and the food is cheap  so don't expect the world's best services 
i came here for a family reunion during a cold winter day  the place was pack as it has quite a reputation so no surprise there  we have to wait for a little bit to get seated  the atmosphere is what you would expect from a typical chinese restaurant  which can be sum up as crowed and loud  we sat down and i had a look at the menu which was rather small compared to other shanghai restaurants  we order quite a lot including their infamous soup dumplings  funny thing is usually the soup dumplings came first however it was the last to arrive although the table who sat down after us like 3 tables away got theirs first which was weird  i tasted the beef rolls and they were good  the consistency  texture  and sweet hoisin sauce left my taste bud wanting more  the soup dumplings was alright  i felt they did not live up to my expectations  well then again  my expectations were much higher than usual due to the over hype surrounding this place  the soup dumplings were big and had a good meat to soup ratio which i give them credit for as usually other places would just have a lot of soup in there and like a small amount of meat which ruins the actual taste in conclusion  the soup dumplings are nothing over the top but they are delicious and nan xiang does it well  the waiter and waitress need to be more attentive as we had no tea or water for our hour and a half there which is ridiculous recommendation beef rollpork soup dumplingspork and crab soup dumplings
i absolutely love the xiao long bao here  purely because its tasteful  full of soup and the chefs that make it here make it with heart i also appreciate that nan xiang has more than just xiao long bao  their cold appetizers are the bomb  especially the vegetarian chicken and tripes as well has their scallion pancakes and pancke with beef this is a new tourist attraction  so prepare for long lines 
i came here on a whim and i'm upset that i trusted the yelp reviews   the xiao long bao (soup dumplings) had barely any meat inside  and had a thick skin   i also ordered the shang hai shu mai   i thought it was going to be filled with meat but it was full of sticky rice!!  i'm disappointed and felt as if i should have ordered the soup bowls instead!  sticking to joe's for the soup dumplings forever and ever   i would give the soup bowls a try though   they looked good from afar 
i'm yet to visit nanxiang dumpling house and not see it packed  it has a very small menu composed of mainly shanghainese dian xing ( mainland version of dim sum)  besides the signature soup dumplings  everything else also impresses with authenticity  while not fit for a big and formal dinner given its menu size  its more than adequate for friends and family to enjoy a fulfilling weekend morning brunch  joe's shanghai has got nothing on this place 
i came here with my bf on a saturday afternoon  we waited about 15 minutes for a table  when we got a table  we ordered the sweet soy bean milk  scallion pancake with sliced beef  turnip puff and steamed crab meat & pork buns the sweet soy bean milk came in a big bowl  it wasn't sweet enough for me  so i had to add extra sugar to it  the scallion pancake with sliced beef tasted like peking duck but with a scallion pancake on the outside instead of a soft bun  it was really good and crispy  the turnip puff was quite interesting  the outside had sesame seeds  and the inside was vegetables  the steamed crab meat & pork buns were bigger than most places that i been too  i thought the dumplings had a lot of favor  the dumplings are very popular  so you might have to wait a while for them   i can't wait to go back and have more dumplings 
even after they extended the restaurant to three rooms  this place is always crowded  i went this weekend at 2pm and there was still a line  luckily  speaking mandarin and smiling at the waitress gave me a bit of an advantage (especially the puppy dog eyes)  i definitely suggest coming here with no more than 2 or 4 people  or else you'll be waiting for quite a long time for the tables to conveniently free up next to each other something to note  this guy next to me came in and immediately ordered 3 orders of the soup dumplings without looking at the menu  20 minutes later  he ate all of them by himself   this moral of the story is that you know you really want to be that guy  he must have been so full and happy   other notable thing  the other things on their menu are actually quite good  the noodles are thin and doughy  and i don't think they use too much oil based on all the rave reviews  you should probably go to flushing and try it at least once  i think it's better than joe's shanghai and shanghai cafe  it's a long trek away from manhattan  but i've always loved flushing for their authentic chinese food  if you're not in the mood for dumplings  there are 30 other amazing restaurants all within a few blocks of each other   happy eating!
once upon a time  i loved soup dumplings   then i had them in shanghai and simply swooned over the perfectly prepared skin  tender and fresh meat filling  and flavorful soup   then i returned to nyc and incidentally had them at joe's shanghai and was so disappointed i could not finish it   at a few other venues since  i was equally dissatisfied a friend noted in passing that this place is always packed and known for their soup dumplings   i hoped all these people must be onto something   being in the area at 5 pm on a weekday last week  with the place virtually empty  i jumped at the opportunity to try it out   my expectations weren't especially high  all told we ordered only the crab pork soup dumplings and the fried chive egg pastry    the dumplings are worth the hype   they are not as good as what i had in shanghai  but they are really the best i've had in nyc   wrapping  meat  and soup were all very high quality and well prepared   thoroughly enjoyed them   chive egg pastry was also a fairly good rendition  with thin  flaky pastry its a tiny place so its no wonder they're packed during peak dining hours   clean  comfortable  and average service   small menu  much of it seems better for sharing than for a single person   would definitely return for the dumplings and try some other things 
a great restaurant with the best soup dumplings in queens  rice cake with shredded chicken was my favorite when i first entered this restaurant i love those soup dumplings where it has that feeling when the saliva is running inside your mouth 
the food is all very delicious  however the wait to get seated is unbelievably long  especially since my party of 3 had to sit at a table for 2  service isn't too great as well  4 stars are for the food only 
food was great  service needs help  i needed a fork a napkin  i got it as i was ready to leave 
came back and ordered 4 orders of the pork xlbs and they were delicious! it made up for the last time we came for dinner and the food wasn't up to par  we came on a weekday around 4pm and although the place was full  we didn't have to wait for a table i have recommended this place to many and will continue to come back!
my husband and i have basically made this place a second home   the soup dumplings are simply amazing!  we prefer the pork dumplings to the crab & pork dumplings  but both are fantastic!  a word of caution to any first timers  the soup inside of these dumplings  is very hot!  the way i eat them is to place the dumpling onto my soup spoon  then pierce or carefully bite the top of the dumpling to allow some of the steam to escape   then  you can add some of the ginger soy sauce provided for an extra element of flavor   make sure you don't just pop the dumpling into your mouth whole otherwise you will scorch yourself!i also enjoy the crispy dough  the salt soy bean milk  the dumplings in peanut sauce  the spicy beef tripe salad and the crispy noodles   the staff are friendly and they always remember us and know what we want   the restaurant has recently expanded  so they have three adjacent seating areas and can accommodate large parties   they are also open early and close late  so you can go whenever you have a craving for soup dumplings   most important to me  as my friends know  is hygiene   their food is clean and i have always left there feeling great (and i am very  very prone to getting sick after a bad meal)   they consistently get "a" ratings  which is so refreshing it is a shame that they are cash only  but if you walk over a couple of blocks to main street  there are maybe 3 banks within close proximity   i highly recommend this place for their wonderful dumplings   one of my all time favorite restaurants!
after being a loyal customer of nan shian's since before both of their expansions  i am finally ready to sit down and write them a review   that being said i guess i have some explaining to do with my 3 star rating i love nan shian's food  the quality and the price really make it worth it  where they lack for me is their service   nan shian's service is a hit or miss   more so a miss which happens to be most of the time (lately) for my buddies and i   one occurrence being this past monday  as we watch those who came in after us receive their xiao long bao before us and even saw them leave before we got our soup dumplings   but i think the moment that really defied there service was the time my friend &i  had received the wrong dumplings  (we love the pork&crab combo and we got just crab) we spoke with the manager and he told us there was nothing they could do about it  that they were already made and asked if we wanted to put in another order  that's not okay  (and neither was the tip we left or lack of)  i use to gluttonize 2 3 times a month in this place  instead  i now come every once in a few month because i won't allow myself to indulge in bad service   so when they are ready to tidy up their tardy and start setting consistant bars of excellence   i will think about giving them more stars   though  there's no denying that their food ingeneral and their soup dumplings are one of thee best   my choice over joe's  which is why i leave 3 stars 
great value for the price   i ordered the steamed pork buns (aka the pork soup dumplings) which were amazing   filled with a fatty  well seasoned beef broth  this dumpling is packed with flavor   the broth contrasts the light airyness of the dumpling   careful not to eat right away  they come out steaming hot   the scallion pancake with beef was great   perfectly crispy  light dough wrapped around delicious beef   i only wish i had more of that beef and sauce on the inside   the pan fried dumplings were crisp  thin dough  and filled with more delicious juice   the reoccuring them of these restaurant seems to be delicious juiciness   i loved the ambiance and restaurant itself  though it was lacking any formal design   can't wait to go back!
this place serves some really good dim sum  it reminded me of a place in la that i really like  din tai fung  i ordered the steamed pork buns  which came out piping hot  i don't know how to make the buns look so cute with the pinched ridges   i just want to eat them up!i didn't feel rushed and the staff were attentive and friendly  i finally got to try a piece of flushing's cuisine  i'll be back for more 
as someone who grew up in nanxiang  i can testify that the soupy dumplings here are as close to what i remember eating in my childhood as one can find in us   others like joe's shanghai or dingtaifeng are just imitators 
foods were okay  but the service was terrible as hell  the waitress gave me the face when i asked for spoon which she didn't give me at the first time  it's not worth to bear her attitude for this meal 
the xlb here are amazing  the skin is not as thin as the one from joe shanghai and the meat inside taste much cleaner because it taste as though they put less msg and it is less oily  and this place knows that they are good  they charge more than most chinatown places  for 6 xlb they charge $5 50  not a bad deal but most places sell 8 for about $5 i also had the chilli oil noodle with beef  it was very greasy but good and they had peppers in there  $6 95 the rice cake with pork taste great here  they have pork  mushrooms  scallions  preserved vegetables in here and the rice cake are cooked al dente  $6 95 i love this place so far  the service is quick  i came here on a weekday night around 8pm and there were a good amount of people  i recommend this place  i have not decide if i like this place more than joe since i only been here once  but will update after i try this place out a few more times before i let you know  btw the menu here is very limited and they do not have shanghai fried rice on the menu   (and they are cash only 
i went on a weekday around 2pm and they had nothing but soup dumplings and cold dishes   huh  ?
as a part of our afternoon evening tasting tour of nyc's better chinese places  i was excited to try this spot in order to compare with joe's shanghai to make a long story short  they're basically a tie   why a tie? (oftentimes i tend to rhyme)when it came to xlb skin texture  joe's executed perfectly  we had more than a few of our xlbs pop at nan xiang  and it wasn't due to "noob"ish chopstick behavior  it could have been because nan xiang stacked our two orders of xlb together  which may have caused the bottom order to accumulate extra moisture  in turn making the skin a bit weaker and prone to puncture  when it came to the flavor of the crab xlb  i'll give nan xiang the upper hand  that crab flavor was really really strong  almost overpowering  but in a good way   so yes  that's it   they're both solid spots for xlb   that's just the truth 
i wanted to force my friends to try authentic chinese food  so i brought them here for my birthday  almost all of them ordered noodles  perhaps because they didn't know how amazing the soup dumplings are  when they tried them  they regretted not ordering them  i usually get the pork ones and love them  the food is cheap and filling  so i always leave satisfied  the service is not bad  i recommend this for anyone who loves chinese food or would like to try authentic chinese food!
not worth the hype  kung fu on main st  (close to 495)  is just as good  if not better  easier parking  better manner waiters  cleaner as well 
came here with a friend one evening as it was listed and suggested to be one of the best soup dumplings spots in queens and across nyc  the place was busy but being a party of 2  we got seated quickly  their staff gave us a tea pot  something most places don't do unless you ask  we ordered the soup dumplings and some noodles   the soup dumplings weren't as great as we thought they would be  the skin was weak and would break when we tried to lift it   soup spilling out  the noodles were good  no complaints overall  worth trying but not my favorite for soup dumplings  not impressed 
we had heard that there was a michelin approved restaurant in this neck of the woods    and a dumpling house at that  we left the hotel in the middle of the night checking our map and making sure everything was right  we guessed at to which way was which and were greeted with the red veneer but only several hops  skips and jumps away  and there was no line at the door    nothing but tables and chairs to host us for the meal to come  ok  enough of the feebly attempted xmas jingle    we ordered almost a bit of everything  we ordered several dumplings  a plate of folded pancakes and a bowl of pseudo spicy noodle soup  everything was solid food   though the ambiance and the service is somewhat lacking that of what you would expect for a michelin anything    but i'd still come back again!;d
love this spot! i am so grateful they expanded so much  because in the past  there was always a long wait to get in   but now you can easily be seated just about any time of day  the dumplings are freshly made and the noodles have a nice chewiness to it  i am thrilled with their vegetarian noodle soup   which has the most flavorful veg soup i've ever had  and the veg dumplings are also very well executed  this place gets that 5th star for doing vegetarians right and keeping the omnivores happy 
the nan xiang dumplings definitely can compete with joe's dumplings   it is juicy and tender in one bite   it is so cheap too  half the price of joe's   the wait  depending on group size  but for three people  less then 15 minutes   our bill came out to be less than 50 dollars for 4 trays of dumplings and three appetizers   overall  nan xiang is definitely cheap eats 
probably one of the best xiao long baos around the neighborhood  their portions are a bit smaller than their competitors at joe shanghai  their rice cake dishes are also very good  service is fast here  as it is in most places in flushing 
food is very yummy and proportions are very generous  came here for lunch  had a soup dumplings  scallion pancake with beef and pork chop soup noodle  the soup noodle in particular came out in a really huge bowl  their menu selection is limited but i like this place and will definitely be back  i would avoid friday and saturday because i see lines out the door during those hours  the food is good but i don't think it's so good that i stand in line for 45 minutes! just saying 
even with a crowd it was a short wait  alice was the nicest server we've had  dumplings are still the best as is the scallion pancake with beef  they made us spicy wontons without peanuts  very accommodating  $42 dinner for 4 with 2 beers  cannot be beat!!
just have the soup dumplings  they are amazing!  i don't even care about the rest of their menu  kinda busy  hole in the wall  they don't speak english  will seat you right next to another couple  but just eat their soup dumplings 
was the 1hr30 trip from brooklyn to flushing worth it? yep i came here with my friend  excited as ever  to have the soup dumplings  at 7pm ish on a sunday night  we were seated right away  we immediately ordered the following pickled cucumbers   refreshing and tangy  great side dish spicy beef & tripe (cold dish appetizer)   delicious! the tripe was chewy  the beef tender  the spicy level just perfect  it was almost sweet  yum pork & crab meat dumplings (6 pieces)   the star of the show  the dough was firm enough that it didn't break apart as you gently maneuvered the dumpling from basket to spoon with the tongs  the soupy goodness in them was enjoyable on its own  even before taking a bite of the meat  the vinegar helped bring the flavors out more pan fried pork dumpling (6 pieces)   although tasty  it wasn't spectacular  skip it and stick to the soup dumplings!service is slightly non existant but hey  as long as you bring me my dishes  i am happy i will be returning here   often 
soup dumplings is good compared to the ones i've had in manhattan  the scallion pancake with beef was a little too sweet for me  their soy bean milk is really fresh  noodles are good but not very much meat with it  i will go back and try other stuff on the menu and see how they are 
chicago is great for many many things when it comes to food  maybe i just don't know or tried any better    but awesome soup dumplings are hard to come around  nan xiang soup dumplings are pretty darn tasty! i have only tried soup dumplings in the east coast are from joe's shanghai and here so i suppose my experience is limited to these two places  the dumpling shell here is a bit thicker than the one at joe's but i actually like it that way  it adds a little more texture to the dumpling and goes well with the soy vinegar  the must haves here are  dumplings (duh) shanghai panfried udon scallion pankcake spicy tendon spicy tripe beefmy sister in law always gets the soy milk and says it's the best around! i love coming here when i visit and can't wait to come back with my family 
first time in flushing and as an abt (american born taiwanese)  i was in heaven  the selection of authentic asian food in this area is to die for  but then again  this is news to no one but me my sister is a huge fan of xiao long bao (soup dumplings)  actually  it is my firm belief that she is a huge fan of black vinegar and the dumplings are just an afterthought  we arrived at an odd time in they day (around 1pm) and we were seated right away  however  right after we were seated  a line formed at the door  devil's luck  i guess  anyways  the place is pretty small  it would probably sit 20 30 people at most  as it was  my sister and i were practically seated at the same table as two other couples  we had to literally stand up and move the table for them to get out  if i was more high maintenance  i would mind  but let's be honest  i'm just there to stuff my face when we were seated  the first thing they brought to the table was a small dish of vinegar and ginger  not a menu  vinegar and ginger  that's when you know you're at the right place  when they automatically assume you are ordering soup dumplings  we shared an order of pork soup dumplings and an order of shui jian bao  they're kind of like   big fried pork buns  i was overexcited when i reached for my first soup dumpling  tore it with the tongs and the soup escaped into the underlying napa leaf  no worries  devour napa leaf too  however  i must say that i was not terribly impressed with the soup dumplings  the shui jian bao on the other hand was amazing  the bun itself was "q"  a taiwanese term that describes the chewy consistency of boba  and just the right amount of crispiness on the edges  a little on the oily side  but doesn't that just mean it was cooked with extra love?rating breakdown 2  2 for taste   came here for the soup dumplings  not terribly impressed  but the shui jian bao compensated for my disappointment  0 5 1 for value   as an asian person  paying ~$1 per soup dumpling is akin to asking me to sacrifice my first born   which now that i think about it  sounds actually a lot easier  for that price  i better be blown away 0 5  1 for customer service   being a busy restaurant  the waiters were understandably rushed  which in asian restaurants means curt but speedy  we definitely got the curt  but not so much the speedy  the table next to us waited for a dish for twenty minutes  when they asked the manager  he just replied "it's coming" in chinese  eventually  they just asked to pay for what they had received and stormed out  no offers to comp their meal  no attempt to placate the angry customers  but then again  what am i saying  this is an chinese restaurant no bonus star  the food was good  the value was all right  but i don't see myself coming all the way out to flushing just to try this again  if in the area  i would probably choose to hit up white bear instead  mm  spicy wontons in the house!
a generally solid place for xiao long bao  they're really good and the broth inside isn't too fatty  crullers and sweet soy milk are always good too  as are the shanghai pan fried noodles  lost a star because they lack variety as to what they offer  but overall i've had no complaints about this place 
yes i'm a sucker for soup dumplings!  my friend took me here as it's one of her favorite places and it didn't disappoint  of course i burned my mouth on the first one as i'm never patient enough to let the steam out  we had a great meal for a great price and even snagged a parking spot (meter parking) out front  i'll definitely be back!!!
best dumplings i have ever had  amazing to have on a cold day  place can get pretty busy though but atleast you know the food is fresh!
most authentic soup dumplings i've ever had in north america! i grew up in shanghai eating soup dumplings all the time  this place had dumplings with so much soup that it surprised me! my boyfriend and i decided to try this place during our temporary stay in nyc and i'm so glad i discovered this gem  the only problem i had with it was its lack of space  our table was an inch away from the next and there was no sense of privacy  at least the food was good!
wow!!!!  what can i say  this place is amazing!  went here tonight with my wife  4 children  and uncles   everything was delicious  we left very full and satisfied   aside from the yummy flavors the food temp was perfect! the best soup dumplings everrrrr  crispy noodles yum! beef noodle soup!!
authentic cheap open late awesome possum
this place is amazing! every time someone visits me from out of town  i take them here  the soup dumplings are fantastic and i love their fresh soy milk (sweetened)  i've been lucky enough to come at times where there isn't a wait  but i've heard that the wait can get really long  the soup dumplings do take a while time to come out  so be sure to order something else to hold you over 
i love this place!my bf & i always crave the soup dumplings(both regular & crab flavored) once in awhile  i love to take a little bite piece off the edge of the dumpling and drink all the soup before i eat the actual meat & bun! oh and putting the vinegar sauce jst give dumplings more flavors!!! and the service improved a lot! i used to get upset over the bad service neglection  but they surely put some effort into it  we used to come in for breakfast  too  try the salty soy soup  i'm definitely going to try every single dish on the menu  so far i've only conquered 15% of their dishes hahaha
nan xiang is delicious and the price is reasonable  sometime u have to wait a while to be seated but it is definitely worth it! i love almost everything they have from soy bean drink to their famous xiao long bao  but u have to wait about 15 minutes for their xiao long bao because it is made on the spot  totally worth the wait!
i made a promise to myself a long time ago that i wouldn't live with the "i wish i did that" in the back of my head  i spent enough time in my life feeling that way  so that's done with  so i went to asia and traveled to all the places i always wanted to go to  and outside of seoul  my favorite place i visited was taiwan  because the weather was perfect (i went in march)  the people were friendly and unpretentious  and   the food was dope okay  so if you love tawianese food like i do  this place is a must soup dumplings  best in the 5 buroughs  it's doesn't touch din tai fung  but unless you want to pay for a $1000+ plane ticket to taipei  beggers can't be choosers  salty doughnut with warm soy milk  can't really distinguish between here and taipei night market  beef scallion pancake  damn that's good  beef noodle soup  i personally like the thick chunks of tender beef  thicker noodles  and pickled greens and cilantro   basically their interpretation is the antithesis of all of that   but hey  i still love it  )we are blessed to live in nyc because every neighborhood has the potential to transport you to another world   meet new people  experience new cultures  and yeah    eat f*cking amazing food with stories to tell  so if you miss taiwanese food or want to see what the fuss is all about  i say get your ass on the 7 train and hit up nan xiang 
there is always a wait  but it's quick and you're seated and eating before hunger sets in  it's so much tastier than joe's shanghai which i haven't been to in many  many years  i always get the xiao long bao  scallion pancakes  and rice cakes  their noodles and cold appetizers are really good  can't really go wrong with anything you order 
pork and crabmeat dumplings are great   all the fun sides are tasty and adventurous
this is the best place for dumplings   be prepared to wait for a table no matter what time you go   their specialty is soup dumplings which you should order as soon as you sit down as those are made fresh and takes time to steam   theres a full staff that makes fresh dumplings nonstop during the day   their fried dumplings  steamed buns and scallion pancakes are delicious also   there's a selection of cold appetizers if you want to be adventurous   i like the wine chicken and the fish   their pork chop noodle soup is a favorite of ours  come hungry and enjoy the wide selection on the menu 
best soup dumplings in nyc  knocking down two stars because that's all i like at nan xiang  everything else is mediocre imo  our waiter forgot to give our order to the kitchen so we waited 30+ minutes for our food  _   i don't recommend ordering the scallion pancakes scallion pancakes with beef    its just a huge deep fried piece of dough with hardly any scallions and 1 slice of beef  boo 
i wasn't hungry when i arrived there  it wasn't busy yet so we were seated promptly  i shared the beef scallion pancake   it was deep fried so it felt heavy  they didn't evenly spread the hoisan sauce  it was overpowering  the pan fried udon noodles tasted good  it was oily though  and the minced beef was so thin and tiny you would have thought it didn't come with beef  finally the crab and pork soup dumplings  it was okay! not bad but not great  it tasted more like fast food  cash only and beware of long wait during peak time 
the necessities pork soup dumplings   well because that's what they're known for!scallion pancake with beef   great crunchy texture combination with the soft soup dumplingscucumber & garlic   acts as a cooling agent and cuts through all the oil and fattinesscheap  delicious  authentic and filling! it doesn't get any better 
i've been here a couple of times but my review will be about the last visit not too long ago and was truly disappointed with their service came here with the family after having some time to enjoy a quick meal with some good shanghainese food   it was a rainy day but luckily we were able to get a seat rather quickly since this place is always packed to the bone!ordered some soup dumplings (which the waittress said it would be a 25 min wait due to the backorders they have to fulfill)  scallion pancakes with sliced beef  spicy wontons and a shanghai seafood noodle dish   the best dish was probably  yep you guessed it  the shanghai seafood noodle dish   were you expecting it to be the soup dumplings?  i couldn't tell you because we waited almost 50 mins and they still never came   after asking the waiter many times for an update  he just said "ok" as if he was concerned but instead he didn't want to deal with us bc others at different tables didn't get their orders as well   we ended up telling them to cancel our order since we had to go disappointing when you come here for the primary reason to eat soup dumplings  yet you have to wait forever to get it?  trust me  from the few times i've ate in the past  it's really not worth the wait 
nan xiang refers to a small sub district in shanghai known for its mantou and in more recent years  its xiao long bao  in china  visitors to the area will most definitely pick up some 'nan xiang xiao long' to mark their visit  akin to cheese steak in philly nan xiang dumpling house by name alone catches everyone's attention  can it be? is the authentic nan xiang xiao long here in our very soil? all hail immigration  bitches! if you hate long reviews   i'd say you should stop reading and give them a try  if you want to hear more rants about xiao long bao  here's my take below compared to joe's shanghai  nan xiang's xiao long bao is less salty  less fatty  and less soupy  it is closer to the "real" nan xiang xiao long but in no way does that mean its better  the skin is slightly thinner  which is a testament to their skill  but unfortunately they also break apart more often (proof of their inexperience?)  they also offer crabmeat option here  joe's shanghai is more daring with their xlb  it's extremely soupy and delivers a more savory taste that's more popular with the western audiences  nan xiang is slightly more tame and delivers a blander taste more welcomed by chinese eaters (chinese people who eat  not demons who eat chinese people ) i do admit that joe's shanghai goes overboard with the oil and fat in their other dishes too  so if i am craving rice cakes  nan xiang will be my go to  for xlb alone  i'll recommend joe's shanghai over nan xiang because they go big on taste and is overall more unique but for shanghainese cuisine in general  nan xiang comes out on top 
excellent dumplings  soup dumplings  noodles  scallion pancakes  even the cucumbers were great   hot tea is served throughout the whole meal so make sure you order a soda or something   service is very fast paced   sit  eat  get out   place is packed so expect to wait for a table   other than that  i'll be back here again 
packed as hell most of the time  so try to come here on a weekday  or when the weather is shit  their xiao long bao is pretty good  it has a thicker skin (which is my favorite part of this food  to be honest) and a pretty big chunk of pork inside)  however  my favorite dish at this restaurant is the shanghai rice cakes  oh my god    i've never had such "q" and chewy stir fried rice cake in my life  even compared to the mecca of shanghainese food  din tai fung  the rice cakes are smaller  but packed with 2x more flavor  their soy milk is also great! my dinner companions and i all ordered sweet soy milk  which came in giant bowls  our table became pretty packed  the soy milk will fill you up more than the food  i think this is how they get you  the quantity is not very big for the price you pay  but you fill up fast from drinking that giant bowl of soy milk!
i recently went here  the food was incredible and the service was wonderful as well  they didn't hover around you or make those fake conversations  we ordered a lot of food and the bill was less than we expected  and the food came out so fast!! we recommend the beef and chili pepper noodle soup and the udon!!
first time here with friends and family and they prefer the pork soup dumplings drunken chicken and so much more  service is okay great pricesgreat soy milkyou know what try everything because you're in for a treat  bon appetite
i have been a longtime customer of this establishment  i have been frequenting this restaurant long before it expanded   i was around when it just opened up and had about 6 tables altogether for seating  after today's visit  i am not coming back here ever again  i strongly believe that the quality of the food is slowly going down  that's usually what happens when a restaurant becomes more well known and expands to accommodate more customers  now  don't get me wrong  from what i know (according to my family)  the xlb and dumplings are still better what's offered in nearby restaurants  however  everything else on the menu is worse than average  we also ordered vegetarian steamed dumplings and a udon noodle stir fry  the noodles were the saltiest  greasiest  most disgusting thing that i have ever tried to date  it felt like i was sticking my tongue into a salt shaker   that's how salty it was! as for the vegetarian steamed dumplings  they tasted all right  what completely ruined the dining experience for me was the service  the service was absolutely horrible  in the past  when i would visit this restaurant with my boyfriend (who looks western)  the waitresses would ignore us and tend to the other customers who look clearly asian and can speak chinese fluently  they ignored us even if we would politely try to flag them down as they passed our table  but they were forgiven and their actions quickly forgotten because the food was still pretty good  until   today  one of the waitresses had the gall to yell at my mother  we ordered an extra dish near the end of our meal because we were still hungry  a tall looking waitress with glasses barely acknowledged our order  and we weren't sure if it was added  so we tried to confirm  our efforts were met with a rude temper from her and a second shorter waitress with a raspy voice  we were kind of annoyed  but let it go  when our order finally came  the second waitress tried to figure out whose table it belonged to  and so we tried to grab her attention for a good five minutes  the waitress not only ignored us  but she also proceeded to yell at my mother for trying to tell her  not only that  but she also went around the other tables complaining to other customers about our attitude  that was the breaking point for us we tried to complain to the cashier  but she denied that the waitress do something that terrible  so we paid our bill  gave them the tip that they deserved (which was zilch)  and left the restaurant forever  never to ever return again 
there are much better places with better service and prices in the neighborhood  they aren't the only choice anymore  service here has become obnoxious  conceited and deplorable  and the portions have becomr much less than before  such a shame 
every time when i don't have any other plans i get to really really enjoy good times with my twin sistah (aka elle p ) back in the days there was only one or two shanghainese restaurants that served xiao lung bao (aka soup dumplings)  scallion pancakes  warm soy milk  noodle soup with grilled pork   i used to love joe's shanghai  but now i've found my new love of soup dumplings! one night she asked me out (always last minute) and i always end up meeting up with her   she chose this place (and had been on my bookmark list for over a year!)   finally was able to try it out   it was packed on a saturday night  you approach to the hostess (by the cashier) to get your number assigned and wait outside (because it's really small inside  and it won't take long if it's a small group)   so get ready to be sandwiched when you sit at a small table ordered the cold appetizer which was fried bean gluten  yummy but a tad cold  for drinks  my twin had tea  and i had a cold soy milk (sweet)   i was able to taste the soy flavor  and it wasn't super sweet (which i like!)*  then we had a scallion pancake with sliced beef wrapped around   the scallion pancake is thick and fluffy  freshly hot  but like my twin says they put a lot of hoisin sauce that i couldn't even taste anything than just the sauce third order was the steamed wonton with hot sauce in a bowl (comes in 8 pieces)   my twin sistah kept asking me questions about this particular order (why there's peanut sauce in it?  why they didn't mention in the menu  some people might be allergic   who invented this?  it's not hot at all   i "kinda" ignored her cause i was too busy eating **last order was the pork and crab soup dumplings (warning  takes more than 15 minutes to make this  if you want this  order ahead of time!)   the skin is good enough to hold the soup (not super thick)   chunks of crab in every dumpling   and another question from my twin was "where's the soup dumpling?" and i said  inside***   and i gave her couple of options to eat the soup dumplings  my favorite is to poke a hole in the skin  pour the soup in the spoon  then put couple of drops of vinegar sauce around  the dumpling and wait for couple of minutes to cool it off   then eat it all!   at the end i slurp the soup from the  spoon and voila!****at the end we left the place happy   ps                                           cash only!                                                                                            * = actually it tasted pretty fresh  like they just made it!** = i didn't ignored her  took me couple of minutes to answer her!   *** = i did not yell at her fyi  i'm always gentle to her **** = apparently the soup fills up the spoon  also not greasy  but soupy flavor! 
couldn't even stay to eat  once we walked in the hostess eating behind the counter didn't even ask us if we wanted to eat  and the waiter who i tried to ask a question too  didn't acknowledge me the first time and the second time gave me the hand! needless to say i walked out! thanks to your horrible staff you lost 2 customers!
good food   we got the crab and pork xlbs (yes there was a small crab shell in one of my dumplings) and the rice cake dish   both very good  but the best thing was the green onion pancake + beef that everyone else has mentioned on yelp  veryyyy goooood   ) also  iced soy milk   tastes like taiwan   )
very authentic chinese breakfast place  love their xiaolongbao and shumai  their xiaolongbao is relatively bigger than the usual ones  but the taste is pretty good  there is a wait usually on weekends but it's not terrible and definitely worth it  the service is pretty quick and nice  i would want to come back another weekend to try their shengjianbao 
the best soup dumpling spot in queens  freshly made and so delicious  the pan fried udon is probably one of the greatest things i've ever eaten  there will definitely be a wait to be seated  but its not too long and its certainly worth the wait 
nan shian dumpling house is a tiny restaurant that can accommodate only about 30 people and serves delicious soup dumplings  sitting elbow to elbow with strangers  and sharing your table with other parties is to be expected  once you get past the cramped surroundings  this place isn't bad at all a lot of comparisons have been made between nan shian and joe's shanghai  i must say that i thought their soup dumplings tasted very much alike  and the competition is just too close to call  but  in any place that serves soup dumplings  there is always an unpleasant odor in the air  i'm not sure why  it's just how it is  at joe's shanghai  it hits you in the face suffocating you and killing your appetite slightly this wasn't the case here  and for that reason alone  i prefer it i ordered the seafood noodle soup  which was definitely better than js  they use different noodles  thin white ones that melt in your mouth as opposed to the thick udon used at other places  they were a little cheap with the scallops  but at only $6 95 for a heaping bowl  i couldn't complain  my mom ordered the pan fried seafood udon  which was greasy and delicious  again  they were cheap with the seafood  but the prices are so low you really can't complain three of us ate here  stuffing our faces until we were full and satisfied  and the bill came out to only $39 
great steamed pork buns  and very friend staff  most of the clientel is mainly chinese  but they have menues in english  its very clean and the place has great prices  the scalion pancake is good too 
xiao long bao 3 5spicy beef noodle soup 4 5rice cake with sea food 3 5scallion pancake with beef 2 5service was fast and decent  but the xiao long bao was just not as amazing as i wish they were!! =( everything else was pretty pare  and the scallion pancake was way too greasy 
came here for a quick snack and had the pork+crab soup dumplings and the chilled jellyfish with radish  the dumplings weren't the best i've ever had but it satisfied my cravings  unfortunately the jellyfish and radish was really oily and bland 
i hate going to flushing  but nan xiang makes it worthwhile  nan xiang has changed over the years  from a small restaurant with the capacity fill for maybe 40  to acquiring the space next door  and then expanding even bigger  but one thing hasn't changed  and it is the quality of their food  whenever i'm here  i always order the same things  the pork soup dumplings or the crab ones (depending on who i'm with) and the pork w  preserved veggies noodle soup  both never fails to satisfy me  the soup juice from the dumplings is very clean and love the fatty bits that the filling adds to it  the filling itself is very flavorful  the noodles always taste fresh   is it freshly pulled? wish i had some dumplings and noodles right now 
the quality of the food here has gone down significantly since last time i came here  worst of all  the service is horrible  the waiter and waitresses try their hardest to ignore all he customers i noticed   my wife and i used to love the soup dumplings here  we used to get 2 to 3 orders  now i feel like we're going to eliminate this place as a must go restaurant when we're in flushing  also the last few times we've been here  we always had to wait  the line used to go all the way out the door  now the place is maybe half full    we won't be back for a while 
we're not sure what the hype was about this place  the crab soup dumplings barely had crab in there and we found a couple of them with crab cartilage and crab shells  it tasted more like pork soup dumplings! we have definitely had better soup dumplings from other places in chinatown  the service wasn't great at all  the cashier in the front seemed like she didn't want to work and when we went up to her to try to be seated  she told us with a nasty attitude to go in the back  the waiters and waitresses seemed like they were pissed to be working  the waitress seemed mad when we wanted to change the meat in the noodle dish  we wanted chicken instead of pork and she seemed all pissed over it  we did not think it was such a big deal  other places do it for us all the time without any complaints  she needs to learn to calm down and chill   our hot sweet soy milk came in a bowl that was hard to drink from  they could have just given us a tall cup  they are not considerate at all  the cold soy milk seems to be popular here though  i don't think we will be coming back  it's definitely not what we expected it to be after we saw all the great reviews  what a disappointment!
we went late at night   and the restaurant was not too busy  we were seated right away  parking is available for $5   it is impossible to park in that area compared to din tai fung  their dumplings are huge  they were flavorful and juicy  we also ordered noodles with black sauce with chili oil  they were fantastic! we ordered two orders of soup dumplings (8)  an order of fried dumplings  and noodles  it came out to be $40  not bad  the dumplings were a little doughy for me   and i prefer din tai fung because of thinness of the dough 
i fly from san francisco for these soup dumplings  we don't have anything close to the quality (looking at you  kingdom of dumplings)  the broth is not a joke or passing fad here and whenever i come to visit my family  i beg to go here   (ugly baby bird gaping kind of beg ) i'm not such a huge fan of crab  but i'm probably just a weird person or fail asian  this spot is way better than joe's shanghai  all locations   the broth is smooth and clear  yet incredibly flavorful  the skin is very thin  but will hold up if you eat it quick and don't let it sit too long  so you're not getting a mouthful of fat  chewy dough at all  i hate it when soup dumpling shops have thick skins and little or flavorless broth  it's a huge part of the harmony that takes place in your mouth!!! yes    even in your mouth if you hurry up and get your butt there  the other dishes are pretty good  though i only eat them because my dragon mother glares at me something fierce if i only eat the dumplings    yea  yea  variety smahriety  i actually really love the sliced jellyfish and radish  though like a true chinese  i ate it without knowing what it was and liked it despite finding out it was a wiggly nasty stinging monster of the sea   i like watching the jellies dance in the aquarium  but didn't really consider seeing them on my plate   but anyway  delicious! maybe i'm not a fail asian after all  i feel this must be the most legit spot outside of shanghai  complete with the somewhat aloof and brusk service  but hey  feed me and i have no complaints  feed me slowly  then that's a different story  wait lines are insane sometimes  arrive when you are not starving  otherwise  arrive with an open mind to eat whatever is placed in front of you  napkin included  (don't judge  it happens )
yes yes yes! this is definitely the go to spot for soup dumplings in flushing  the quality at joe shanghai has definitely went down since they opened but this place has constantly provided great tasting dumplings  they also have a better variety of little tapas style food that you can order around your dumplings to make a great meal  price is also very good 
omg this place is phenomenal defiantly recommend anybody that would love a morning hearty breakfast
absolutely delicious this is definitely one of the places that i'd want to go to whenever i'm in the tri state area and i very well may make it a point to hang around in flushing for a bit if i'm simply 'going through 'the skin was a little thck to be absolutely freaking awesome super duper i must come here all the freaking time  but the shear amount of soup that was in these guys put it over into the realm of 5 stars for me i typically don't like the crab version of xlb that much as they tend to have too much of a "xing wei" to me   however  these guys were quite mild and delicious   i preferred them over the plain pork ones for sure when you visit a place at 11 30pm at night and there's still a wait  you know you up for some good grub   my cousins  looking over the menu  asked me if i wanted this or that and i simply asked them "is there a place better for that dish?"  typically the answer would be "yeah this place down the street has better " "we're going there next  then "
crowded  rushed place   i don't know  another place that was overhyped for me perhaps   i thought the soup dumplings would impress me more than they did   my date loved them  said they are the best you can get   better than at joe's i found them a bit bland    all we ordered were the crab pork soup dumplings   so i can't speak on the other dishes   would try back for a second shot on a really cold winter day  i like to have hope   maybe then i'll see what all the hype is about?
i prefer coming here instead of joe's shanghai  they recently expanded this place  and now there are three rooms of seating  i love their soup dumplings with pork (i'm not a fan of the ones with crab)  their scallion pancake with beef is probably the next best thing on the menu  the pan fried udon noodles and the rice cake dishes are good too  but sometimes they add a little too much oil there are many food options in flushing  but this restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots 
this place has pretty good xiao long bao (pork soup dumplings)  but i really like their pig ear  jellyfish salad  spicy beef tendon  spicy beef & tripe  shanghai wonton  and their drunken chicken  youtiao (chinese doughnut) and du jiang also good 
if you have not been here it is a must!!!!! best food around!everyone must try the scallion pancake with beef    life changing!!!!!!!!!!!!
even though i am shanghainese  i don't get to eat xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) nearly as much as i would like  in fact  i used to visit the joe's shanghai (in chinatown)  before being introduced to nan xiang through yelp  now  this is the place i go to for some xlb i recently came here (from the city too!)  to eat dinner with my bf and maybe catch the knicks game somewhere  as it was a chilly day in nyc  i suggested nan xiang for some soup dumplings  we arrived shortly before 7 and were seated immediately  we settled on one order of the pork dumplings (6 to an order)  and the shredded pork rice cake (nian gao  another shanghai staple)  the dumplings were very good  as were the nian gao  albeit a little harder than i'm used to (that's what she said?)  even though i wasn't particularly hungry (7 is still a little early for dinner for me!)  my bf and i demolished all the food  i definitely recommend the pork dumplings  any of the rice cakes and the fried bean gluten  the food isn't terribly expensive  so i do plan on coming back and trying the other things on the menu!they take cash only  so make sure you have some on hand 
i've been here two days in a row! the food is absolutely delicious! the steamed pork and crab buns and fish w  salt cabbage noodle soup are my favorites so far  i will be trying the sweet soy bean milk and fried dough today as well! this place is a must if you enjoy authentic chinese cuisine 
i love to try new things  of all the places i've eaten scene my stay in new york  this place is one of the best places i have ever eaten  i never had a shanghai dumplings before  but i can say that this is the closest dumplings to the real deal 
very satisfied with the food here  we had the pork chop noodles  dumplings  scallion pancake and the pork buns  truly satisfying! one downside though  they don't take cash 
this place is legit! i have never had soup dumplings before my first visit here and boy was i missing out  the soup dumplings were so fresh and tasty  thinking about them is making me salivate and want to drive to get some right now  the spicy bamboo was also very very good  i had a noodle soup which was just ok which is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5  if i only had soup dumplings it would be a 10!
my most recent visit here was abit disappointing because  i always get the soup dumplings  i usually get two serving of it  one pork and one with crab  but this time when i ordered a pork and crab soup dumpling  i notice more than half of them didn't have crab in them  i  wanted to ask one of the staffs' there but decided not to cause i knew it wouldn't matter  how will i prove it  it has the golden bits of crab on top of the dumplings but not inside  didn't want to leave a tip but saw one of the waiters ran after another customer down and ask them for it  last thing i want  the skin of the dumplings were ok but a few of them broke when i picked it up  i do like their hot plain soy milk  they are a busy place and popular but that does not mean they should neglict their food service and food quality 
this is my go to place for soup dumplings! much better then joe shanghai in my opinion  it is usually always packed but i never had to wait long for a seat  took away one star because it takes a while for the dumplings to be served  usually all the other food comes first and we would finish pretty much everything before the dumplings are served and by that time we are already full  we had to cancel the dumpling orders on two difference occasions because it took so long and we were too full even though we went there for the dumplings  however it is still very much worth it when i'm in a soup dumpling mode  my favorite are the crab xiao long bap and the regular pork one  the shanghai pan fried udon noodles are very good as well and my boyfriend enjoys the spicy beef tripe  writing this review makes me hungry 
great soup dumplings  beef pancake and stir fried rice cakes  pretty consistent  always enjoy my food here 
love love this place  dined in with my sister and brother the other night  they are always packed!! but when you order to pick up they prepare the food quickly  great service every time  their pan fried noodles are great  i always get that when i come  their veggie dumplings are also great  i tried their cucumber salad  was ok   too much garlic for me  if you're in flushing definitely pass by this restaurant and try their dumplings and pan fried noodles 
this shanghai style dumpling house sits on prince street  which is full of delicious chinese restaurants  nan xiang manages to stand out from the rest with a solid offering of shanghai cuisine  including what i consider to be the best xiao long bao (soup dumplings) in nyc!their menu is very focused  with a great core selection of dishes including various dumplings like their shanghai shao mai  which is filled with a sticky rice mixture  their noodle soups are also very delicious  with a great  clean tasting broth and a generous heap of toppings and noodles on my last trip  we ordered two baskets of xiao long bao  one with crab and one with pork  an order of the shao mai  a salty sticky rice roll  and a pork and cabbage noodle soup  we arrived at around 8 30 on a sunday morning  and we had no wait the noodle soup and sticky rice roll arrived first  the noodle soup was a great breakfast  the soup was very savory and clean tasting  and the pork and cabbage were seasoned very well  the noodles were of the perfect thickness and were cooked to perfection as well  the sticky rice roll arrived in the shape of a banana  wrapped in plastic and cut in half  the filling was salty and complimented the sweet ish rice perfectly the shao mai came out next  these are different compared to most shao mai around the area  instead of a meat mixture filling the dumplings  it is filled with a sticky rice mixture  it has a very interesting texture  and with the soup it was delicious  but perhaps a bit dryish on its own the highlight of meals here is always the xiao long bao  i've been to a few joints around the city  and i believe that this is the best i've had so far  both the crab and pork dumplings were seasoned very well  with a perfect amount of the flavorful yet clean finish broth filling the skins the service was standard flushing chinese service  and was effective go here for soup dumplings! grab a noodle soup as well if you're hungry 
if you love dumplings like i do  this is a must visit  as someone who is not korean and not terribly familiar with the food  i went with the server's recommendations and a few personal selections  everything was delicious and i filled myself up  wonderful service and we got a seat with no problem  classic mistake  we didn't use the spoons provided to eat the dumplings  so we lost a lot of the tasty juices  amateurs! i'll try to remember next time 
i had a horrible experience with my boyfriend where our soup dumplings tasted like dish washing liquid  the employee admitted that the utensils may not have been cleaned properly but the entire batch of soup dumplings reeked of soap  aside from this instance  most of the time the food is good but the service is always terrible  i'm always rushed for my order or ignored by my waiter  on multiple occasions they've forgotten part of my order and refuse to deal with me if i ask what's taking so long  however  this place still remains my go to spot for soup dumplings in flushing 
i had soup dumplings in taiwan and these were even better! awesome soup dumplings!! cash only! great prices  fast service! i get what all the hype is about! i only gave 4 stars due to the informal ambiance but we will be back!
great soup dumplings (my family always orders the pork and the pork & crab)  garlicky seawood and savory sliced pig ears  i like the soup dumplings better than joe's shanghai  they have a little area where you can see the women making the soup dumplings and they're always hard at work  i'd skip the noodles; i've tried several (beef and chili pepper noodle soup  panfried seafood noodles  shredded pork panfried noodles) and wasn't impressed by any of them  scallion pancake was also disappointing  a little too thick  not enough scallion and not flaky enough  the service is typical flushing service  no frills  it's a good place to eat a satisfying meal  warning about the soup dumplings  be careful how you eat it because it's steaming hot inside  it might not be the best place to eat if you're starving because if you eat them too quickly  you'll burn your tongue edit  went there again tonight and they use real crab meat  i was always a little skeptical but we found little pieces of crab shells in some our soup dumplings tonight  yum   
i would pick this place over joe shanghai any day  the soup dumplings are def made fresher   i actually feel like its more flavorful too  i love the rice cake nooodles! and their cold appetizers one thing i dislike is the service  way to slow  
the churro like dessert donut with soy milk isn't that great but their xiao long bao is the best tasting and the best priced in the city  you will not find another spot that tastes as good and as cheap as nan xiang  worth the trip into queens 
came here with some friends  some familiar with chinese "brunch" and some who only know of americanized chinese food  needless to say  everyone loved it here  the xiaolongbao were pretty darn good  although still not sure if it's worth the trek we also ordered scallion pancakes with beef  and salty sweet soy milk  can't beat $1 sweet soy milk  especially in new york  we also ordered some less adventurous dishes  like dumplings and rice cakes  my white friends were all kind of reluctant at first  but once they tried it all  they were hooked the check came out to less than $10 a person  and we were all pretty stuffed from all the food we ordered  i live in manhattan  so i wish it was a little closer  but definitely next time when i'm feeling a trip to flushing  i'll definitely go here over joe's shanghai 
this is the worst restaurant i have met  the waitress is so bad  serving is so slowing like turtle running  dumplings is like shit! fucking chinese things  the  fucking son of bitch  waitress attitude is so arrogant 
the best soup dumplings in nyc period  i dot wanna hear any shit about joe shanghais so just stop  also try the shanghai noodles 
we have been here many times but this is my first time leaving a review  the soup dumplings are the main reason you come here but they also have other things on their menu which should be ordered  we always get the crab soup dumplings  scallion pancake with beef  spicy beef with tripe  and a rice cake dish  why only 4 and not 5 stars? their service is spotty  there is one girl that has been there for a long time and is always on point but there are others that shouldn't be working there at all  we wanted to order the spicy beef and tripe the last time we were there and she told us they were out  few minutes later 2 tables had their orders placed on their table  keep in mind this is a cold dish and does not need any prep at all from the kitchen  we asked again and she never came back to our table 
i've had a handful of soup dumplings (mostly mediocre) from various places in nyc  so  i'm confident enough to say that nan xiang and joe's shanghai stand out the most  i can't really pinpoint which is better unless i eat them at the same time but nan xiang's soup dumplings are above standard (meaty inside  flavorful broth  and thin skin)  here are 2 things i can compare between the two restaurants  you can either order 6 pork dumplings for $5 50 and or 6 crab & pork dumplings for $6 50 at nan xiang while you can get 8 dumplings for similar prices at joe's  also  nan xiang has less items on its menu (2 pages) compared to joe's  another winner dish at nan xiang was the scallion pancake with sliced beef  out of this world! crispy on the outside and chewy oily in the inside with a piece of marinated beef covered in lots of sweet hoisin sauce  i do wish there were more scallion pieces in the pancake to enhance the dish  i could eat 2 of this myself and i will next time now onto the bad stuff (you knew it was coming)    the sitting situation is a little awkward depending on your luck  these people will stuff you in any table available  we had the worst luck having to sit in a one of the three tables connected together in a row with 2 other groups  as for the service  you'll be treated the same like most chinese restaurants   i saw the host "politely" telling one of the patrons to get his own chopsticks    oh  this may be irrelevant but they also had 6 workers cramped up into a small corner with glass walls making made to order soup dumplings  is this really necessary?fyi   we had no troubles getting in at 4pm since we got there before the rush  there was a line out the door around 5pm 
came in 4pm on weekend in the hope to avoid the crowd and taste the famous crab meat xiao long bao  yet waited for 30+ min and still waiting  waitress felt sorry too but what's wrong with the operation 
we love their soup dumplings  price is very reasonable  just the wait is a little  long  
this is the among most authentic xiaochi (snacks) you can find in the us  do not go here expecting traditional "cantonese" dim sum    best xiaolongbao (pork soup dumplings) i've tasted in america  quality surpasses joe's (thanks to thin skins) and approaches ding tai feng    spicy cucumbers are mild but fresh and tasty  xiandoujiang (salty soy milk) was a fully seasoned and delicious  though i would have preferred to add the vinegar myself  steamed veggie dumplings  bland and lifeless everywhere else  were fully flavored  wonderful!  sweet stuffed sticky rice was a little to sugary for my taste   everything is inexpensive! service was pleasant enough though slow and inaccurate  washrooms should be kept cleaner   if these problems can be resolved  nan xiang would rate a full 5 stars in my book bottom line  nan xiang is a rare  treasure   ivery few places in us are similar  except the few a&j restaurants in wash dc and california 
maybe the best xlb outside of asia   nian gao was on point as well   everything here was top notch quality and well worth the long wait 
great soup dumplings (pork buns)  expect a huge lunch crowd  all three dining rooms are full and the line is almost out the door  the crispy noodle dishes are good  cash only 
this place is good  not great  the soup dumplings yielded excellent savory juices but the filling itself and the skin just didn't impress me  also  the scallion pancake was way too breaded and deep fried (it's not usually treated like a fritter) but i did like the authentic gingery dip they provided  the pork and vegetable wonton soup was fine  but the broth didn't have a lot of depth  what pleasantly surprised me was the rice cake with shredded pork  full and flavorful  but not heavy  with generous helpings of rice cake  pork  shittake mushroom  cabbage  and carrots 
i have had many  many soup dumplings  and these are some of the best  if not the best   similar to joe's  but with even thinner dough   really  really good   the other items were awesome too  and everything was super cheap   on top of that  you don't get the brusque service you get in chinatown (at least we didn't)  easily worth the trip to flushing cash only   
being vegetarian  it was a little hard to order from here  the meals that are "non meat" are pretty simple and loaded with carbs  after eating  we realized that we ate nothing but "bread"  however  the food was good  wish the fried noodle and rice dish had more veggies in it    but the scallion pancakes were on point  the staff was friendly & the service was quick  it'd probably be a better fit for those who do eat meat though 
small little place with a huge crowd and some decent xlbs  pretty authentic if you ask me   i couldn't even read the outdoor sign!xlbs had thin skin and burning hot soup  took a while to get  but i suppose that just means it's super fresh!spicy beef and tendon   spicy and full of flavorgreen onion pancakes  really chewy on the inside  poofy fried crispiness on the outside beef roll (green onion pancake with beef)  not much beef  sauce  or flavor on the inside   sick with the classics people!overall  food's pretty good  and the prices ain't too shabby either!
came here while wrapping up an extensive food tour of flushing with friends  everyone was stuffed so we just ordered the signature dish here  xiao long bao  both crab and pork  probably the best version i've had of this dish  with dumplings filled to the brim with piping hot soup  liked the pork over the crab  will venture out here again to try other dishes 
4 5 stars (minus  5 for service)heard from locals to visit this dumpling house on prince street must orders   1) steamed crab meat & pork buns  beware of the juices! it bursts in your mouth (and on your spoon if you don't catch it in time)  pairs well with the vinegar & shaved ginger sauce dipping sauce   i'm going to miss these flavors   2) pan fried dumplings   the dumpling is juicy on the inside and has a crispy seared outside!   oh so good!  (husband's favorite)3) shanghai pan fried u don is also a tasty    great savory flavors and slightly on the greasy side  hearty portion  if we had more room in our tummies  would've ordered green onion pancakes  next time for sure!service they took our orders quickly   language barriers caused some pointing for clarifications   a lady wait staff threw one of our dishes  causing some food items to fall off the plate = minus  5 stars    other than the minor service boo boo  dumplings were juicy and excellent 
the food is not as good as many people claim them to be and the service is soooooooooo bad  we came here 5 minutes after it opens  and it took the waitress 10 minutes to get the menu  when we made the order  the waitress didn't bother to write it done and then conveniently forgot one of our order  we had to wait for 30 minutes and talked to the waitress twice to get the things figured out everyone came after us got their orders and was eating while we stared at our empty table  and when they serve the soymilk  the waitress was so sloppy that the milk got spilled all over the tray  and the waitress is really rude whenever we tried to talk to them  i got so angry at this place and decided to reflect my bad experience on the tips  and before we exited from the front the door  the waitress literally yelled at us and saying that we didn't leave them enough tips  srsly????? i refused to give more tips and simply told them their bad service and rude attitude didnt deserve any tips
my grandma and my fiancée are both from shanghai so i've had a lot of great soup dumplings there  i'd give a 4 5 for nan xiang's soup dumplings  they are kind of too large and the skin a little bit thicker  but the filling is very tasty and juicy  besides dumplings other dishes here did not impress me  but i think people come here for dumplings 
my car was looking so bad and queens finest collision fixed my car she looks like a princess again i was so happy for the work that they did on my car the manager ryan was very courteous and very helpful i recommend all my family and friend to go there if they need there car to be done my baby is ready for the summer i'm so happy and satisfied 
decor   3service   3presentation   3taste   3when this place first opened  i loved it! but that was many years ago now  every time i go  all i taste is the msg in all the kitchen cooked food  i  should have learn after the first 2 times  but for some reason all my friends think this place is really good   don't get me wrong the taste is average  but just way too much msg for me  dishes i recommend soup dumplingsbeef noodle stir fry
great xiao long bao place  i would've preferred the skin to be a bit thinner  but nonetheless  the broth inside was rich and the stuffing inside was adequate and tasty 
their soup dumplings are so yummy   maybe the best in the city   prices are extremely reasonable  and while the wait isn't great  the crowds demonstrate what a great "cheap eats" joint this is   also try the crispy noodles and the beef scallion pancakes   the veggies were another pleasant surprise ( cucumbers  mushrooms)
dumplings were good  but not as good as joe's shanghai in chinatown  i haven't been to joe's in flushing  but yelp reviews are much better for the one in chinatown so i'm assuming they're not quite the same at joe's chinatown my taste buds were just excited with all the flavors  here at nah xiang it was something more like home made kind of good  something that i feel i can make in my kitchen by looking up a recipe online  at joe's it felt a bit more special than that the pork and salted cabbage soup was just outright bad  pork was as chewable as rubber  broth really boring  noodles stuck together and cabbage had a weird flavor  pretty disappointing  the portion was enough for 3 but i doubt even 1 out of 3 would want it  there are so many good noodle soup options in flushing that's it's not even worth a try at nah xiang's the scallion pancake with beef was good except for the sauce used on the beef  the taste of the sauce wasn't good and was so overpowering  the rest of the pancake was actually pretty good  i'd order one without beef next time   hopefully it doesn't have that black sauce on it as true for most spots in flushing  pricing was more than reasonable overall  i'd come back here for dumplings if i didn't want to wait in a 45min line outside of joe's shanghai in chinatown in the freezing cold 
okay  so  the best option at this spot are the crab xiao long bao  well  at least in my humble opinion   although i'm super openminded about foods  i never realized that buns could be made with crab as a filling   well  simply put  it's amazing  this stuff is really the salvation of humanity   asian foods to save the world with its variety   along with your crab xiao long bao  i also recommend that you add the scallion pancakes   they are not exactly pancakes but an open mind will thank you   scallions are awesome and so is this place   highly recommend 
its so far away from manhattan but its worth the trip  the food is cheap (price) and delicious  the xiao long bao is delicious with yummy soup  the scallion pancake with beef is also really good 
i am 100% shanghainess with a very hard to please culinary preference  first of all  i classify this as a dim sum shop and not a restaurant  so other than the steamed mini pork buns  don't bother with the dishes as they are all pretty much subpar   the steamed buns (and stop calling them dumplings  only round wrapped boiled things are called dumplings) come in two stuffed fillings  pork and pork crab meat crab yellow egg imo  the pork ones are the best in nyc (forget joe shanghai  not even close to authentic style with that much soy sauce added)  the crab meat ones are at a close second  only inches behind that one tiny shop in the food court of golden world shopping mall   service attitude is indifferent to bad  waiting gets longer and longer  but hey  their buns are tasty and if you are unhappy with the service  you could choose to cut back on the tip 
this is the only place i would go to when i crave xiao long baos   whenever i go there  we would always order 2 or more order of the delcious tiny things   they are the perfect size with their delicious nice touch of the broth and warming to the heart   i also love ordering their cold side dishes   the glutten with the mushroom is a must order! i would always order it and munch on them before my soup dumplings come   with my drink of choice hot unsweetened soy milk  the dumplings in the mixture of peanut butter sauce is fantastic as well   it is always crowded in the restaurant and there is always a wait  but its highly recommended and everyone else waiting knows it is good too   i recommend all my friends to come here for the best tummy warming xiao long bao they have ever had!  )
the food is not terrible  but definitely is not all that good either  joe's shanghai soup dumplings are far more superior  the crab soup dumplings does not have any crab flavor at all  i also ordered the beef and pepper noodle soup which was so very bland that i had to pour hot oil in it for it to taste somewhat better  my fiance ordered a fried noodle dish which never came well after 45 minutes (we asked the waitress to check for us too)  by then  we already finished the soup dumplings and my noodle soup and still nothing  a guy who sat in the table next to us ordered that same fried noodle dish the same time we did got his in like 10 minutes and by the time he was done eating  we were still waiting for ours  at least if the food was good  i would say it is worth the wait but it really is not  we ended up just canceling that order  they were not apologetic at all  no plans to return 
this shanghainese restaurant is really authentic  as a shanghainese now living in new york  i have tried many famous shanghainese restaurants in the city  but this one is always the closest to my 20+ years memory of classic shanghai cuisine  to be accurate  the menu provided by this restaurant only covers the food and drinks usually served as the breakfast in shanghainese culture  things like shaobing  youtiao  soy milk  shanghai shao mai  pan fried pork buns (or sheng jian bao in chinese) and salt soy bean curd (or xian dou hua in chinese) are my favorites i strongly recommend steamed pork buns (or xiao long bao in chinese)  steamed pork buns have various types in different regions in china  but the one from shanghai is one of the best  known as 'nan xiang xiao long bao'  nan xiang is a small town located in the suburban area of shanghai  which is famous for the best xiao long bao steamed crab meat & pork bun is usually considered as a premium variation  as crab meat in china is usually more expensive  i liked it as well  but steamed pork bun  to me  are always the no 1 because it is the most classic 
small place but the soup dumpling with crab meat are fantastic! would only go there for that 
the size of their shanghai pan fried noodles were just like an appetizer   other than that  we love especially the scallion pancake with sliced beef  so good!
the dumplings were not among the best but it is one of the good ones  you won't regret coming here and trying this out  i pretty much ordered all the dumplings in the menu because i was really hungry  i pretty much forgot the names but the pan fried are the best  i would skip the soy sauce that's on the table  made the mistake of putting that on the dumplings and ruined most of it  it's sour and not tasty at all  stay away  the most annoying part is that they do not take cards so have your cash ready or end up walking 2 blocks for the nearest atm  for the most part  the dumplings are doable  i didn't try the other items in the menu  i did get the spicy beef stripe  that was a really good food  the spice on it is really tangy and has that paprika sort of tongue vibrating ingredient which makes the meat really fun to eat  the only sad part is that it comes cold  i would really love to have that with some liquor  overall  love the dumplings  will be back for the other items with cash!!!
very authentic shanghai style food   the xiao long bao  or soup dumplings  are hot and we'll made so they don't break   the soup stays inside the dumpling ready to slurp 
i have to be fair the soup dumplings here were really good   skin was thin  soup was tasty  meat was tender   all the right qualities of soup dumplings the shanghai noodles was the disappointment   they were really hard to chew  sauce was bland  and not enough meat (i only saw a few strips of pork)   they do ask you to share the table with strangers during busy time  so be prepare to jump into other people's conversation and vice versa!
my husband and i dream of this place every few weeks  work up a craving strong enough to brave the ridiculous traffic on main street and when we make it  we order our usual  lots of pork soup dumplings  shanghai pan fried udon with extra shanghai bok choy  scallion pancake   sometimes the beef one   spicy cold tripe and beef (he eats the tripe  i eat the beef)   it has cilantro  pepper  celery  yummmm  today i saw an old man with lots of churros before him and  happening to crave a cronut this morning  asked what it was  one crispy dough without sugar or salt  just plain deep fried dough  yummmmmmm  one for $1 50 
the food is food  just a little wait  service is ok  i love the rice cake and the beef pancake 
worth  the  wait there's always a hugongo line outside    so just come during the off hours or when they first open! the expanded the place so seating is a lot more abundant and thus the wait isn't terrible  the xlb's are tdf (i ruv abrevs  d)  my mom & i come here a lot especially after i returned from studying abroad in shanghai and really wanted some authentic shanghai grub  i've had their rice cake w beef several times and it's good but nothing to rave about  def def def get their crab meat & pork xlb's & sesame cake w  sliced beef  they've always been out of the sticky rice rolls when i go there  but that's because it's more of a breakfast food  wah   (
soup dumplings were only ok   not enough crab flavor   i've had better   don't believe the hype   girl didn't like it either 
i've already been here twice in three days  first time  we had one order of xiao long bao  and the beef noodle soup  the xiao long bao was delicious  the skin was made really well  and it was extremely soupy  according to my friend  the xlbs come freshly steamed everytime someone orders it the second time we came back  i had one and a half order of xlbs to myself  boy was i satisfied  especially as it was snowing pretty heavily outside  if you're visiting the area and you've never been here  this place is definitely worth a try 
i love this restaurant! the food definitely is legitimate and super tasty! the prices are so reasonable for the portion sizes my party tried the pig's ear  jellyfish  scallion pancake and two orders of the soup dumplings  all of us were raving about it by the end of the meal  all for $27 the wait outside wasn't too long (approximately 15 minutes) but they are very efficient about getting people in and out  the soup dumplings can take a while to come out because it takes time to make a fresh batch! it is definitely worth the trek out to flushing from manhattan because it's cheaper faster than a flight to asia  )
their handmade steamed dumpling  fabulous  it was the right amount of doughy and crunchy for the skin  the meat juices inside was a little bit too oily for my taste  but the seasoning of it was on point  their wontons were probably my favorite  it was handmade  large (let me say it again  large)  perfectly seasoned  with skins at just the right thickness  the broth it came in was clear and refreshing  aside from that  i also had the roasted duck handpulled noodle soup  everything  from the duck to the noodles to the broth  was exactly perfect  i must go back for more!
authentic soup dumplings  soup is a little fattier than other places  the pork buns are unbelievably good  i've never had anything like it  they take a while to make but you realize why when you first bite in 
loved this place! food was great and not greasy  the steamed vegetable dumplings were my favorite  by far! warning   cash only!!
great dumpling and noodles!! michelin guide recommended!*this place is now reopen as of 1 18 2013!!**this place is currently under construction as of 1 8 2013*
i ate here with my family  we got 3 "longs" of xiao long bao  1  steamed crab and meat pork buns2  steamed pork bunshighly recommendedtheir appetizers the stuff in the front (all very good) spicy  salty  especially when you're really hungrywe got 3 different kinds of noodle soup1  pork chop noodle soup (kind of bland  btu that's because i'm used to the pork chop lunch box from the old lai lai restaurant on the corner) but the pork chops remind me of that place and it came with a ton of noodle and a little bit of baby bok choy2  fish and salt cabbage noodle soup   more flavor than the pork chop but both were still very good3  crispy noodle with beef  (any crispy noodle with any topping is awesome)overall the food is really good  the service is like you'd expect at any flushing restaurant haha crazy chinese people
food is always good when i go here! i usually get the xiao long bao and any one of the rice cake dishes  when i want to splurge  i also get the beef wrapped in scallion pancake  i've never tried any of the cold dishes though  would not recommend coming here with a big group and the waiters are prone to forgetting about you 
xlb sucks  skin super thick super hard super dry  do not understand why there's a line  shanghai fried noodles is not to the standard too  do not waste your time 
one of the best place for soup dumplings   it's better then joe shanghai  this small but always busy the soup dumplings are very tasty  but be careful when you eat ir because it is super hot ! if you come here try the beef pancake   it is a scallion pancake wrap in beef with a sweet sauce   the price is decent  fairly cheap  i always come here when i want soup dumplings  my favorite one is the crab soup dumplings 
seeing that nan xiang is michelin recommended i had high expectations decor  3 5service  2 5 5 we waited a good 15 20 minutes for 3 orders of steamed pork buns  that's just sillyfood  2 5  @ $5 50 for six steamed pork buns i expected these to blow away my taste buds  that wasn't the case  with gentle and adept hands  all the buns tore apart so easily ruining the soup dumpling experience   the dumplings ripped at the bottom so it definitely wasn't how they were handled with the tongs the dough was slightly thicker and "stickier" than shanghai cafe where my lips felt like they would stick to each other too easilyshanghai cafe  1  nan xiang  0
we came on a rainy night  which may have been why we only waited 10 minutes for a table for 5  i had called in advance to see if they served alcohol and they said they only served beer  i asked if i could bring my own wine and the woman on the phone agreed    the host and server both seemed a bit rude  but i think it may have just been the cultural and language barriers  after we had studied the menu for a bit  the waitress asked us  "what do you want?" at first  it sounded like a very rude way to ask us  but i then realized her english was quite broken and that may have been the only way she knew to ask the question  she was then  very helpful in explaining to us the menu items and answering any follow up questions we had     we got scallion pancakes  3 orders of soup dumplings  pan fried noodles and sipped on the wine we brought from home  the soup dumplings and scallion pancakes were delicious  the soup dumplings are hot  so you must bite a small hole into it and let the steam out for a minute or so   but once you've bitten into it  the hot soup soothes your soul and will leave you wanting more   the laughable part was after we feasted  for what seemed like hours   our bill of $47 came  we all laughed  $47 for 5 people is so cheap  we all thoroughly enjoyed our experience  from the food  to the helpful staff  eager to bring us more orders of dumplings     i went back the next day on my own  i ordered to go  an order of soup dumplings because i just had to taste them again 
i know this place is known for their soup dumplings  and i'm sure they are amazing  but i have never had them  i always get the veggie dumplings and they are good too! my aunt and i are vegetarians so we always get an order or two of these while my parents and uncle chow down on some chicken noodle dish and those damn good smelling and looking soup dumplings the service here is typical no nonsense no frills chinese restaurant service  quick  efficient  not unpleasant 
excellent soup dumplings   you can watch the three dumpling ladies make them fresh and steaming hot right to your table   paired with the shanghai pan fried udon or scallion pancake  you will definitely not go home hungry 
they literally just expanded this place again and now the space is even bigger what does that mean wait time to sit down is nothing now !!prossoup dumpling   originals or crabpan fried noodlesscallion pancakes original or meatfree tea !!cons you eat so much and then you see the bill it's not expensive but if you love to eat and have a deep stomach your going to spend 25 but you will have the best food ever !!!
great food  left satisfied
i loved this dumpling house  decent food  great traditional dishes 
what is soupy  tasty  meaty  and awesome   their dumplings!!!!   this place had amazing food   i went with ec and jay and we ordered up a storm   jay had the most amazing soup with meat and noodles and also the pan fried noodles he had were the bomb!!!!  ec and i had seafood udon noodles which were only okay   the fish was the best part   we also had turnip rolls and those dumplings   overall a really tasty experience   i will be going back!!!
omg their bun is the best ever! i love it love it love it! definitely recommend to anybody who wanna get some authentic chinese shanghai xiao long bun!
xiao long bao  xiaolong bao  xiaolong bao and spicy beef noodle soup  wish there were more dishes to order here but why mess with greatness?long waits  check  harried waitstaff  check  cash only  check  flushing parking  check net net  epic food at flushing prices  can't remember joe's shanghai  it's been so long since this place came into my life 
absolutely worth the wait  enjoyed lunch here with a large group of friends  soup dumplings  pancakes  dim sum  rice cakes  a variety of soups (among several others that we tried)  everything was cooked and spiced to perfection  the soup dumplings were a treat the seafood soup and the spicy beef dim sum were my two favorites  rich broth and tender noodles in the soup and a wonderful spicy peanut dressing on the dim sum the restaurant was packed on a saturday  and we had to wait about 15 minutes (as promised)  our wait staff was terrific and the many dishes we ordered delivered in nice succession allowing the meal to continue at a delicious pace would definitely come back when i'm in the neighborhood 
very authentic place for shanghai soup dumplings  get the beef noodle broth and taro fritters  what a gem in the heart of flushing  parking could e a problem so take public transportation 
cheap  delicious soup dumplings  it doesn't get any better than that  they offer two types of soup dumplings   regular pork and pork + crab  i say  get one of each and go to town  i usually order a cold dish appetizer (i'd recommend the seaweed or the fried gluten) and a rice cake dish to go along with the dumplings  all this for ~$10 a person if you're with 2 or 3 friends 
great food  low price  sometimes line can be long for big groups  one of the best xiaolongbao places in ny
i haven't been to this dumpling house for awhile   my cousin visiting from hk  naturally i want to take her to the best restaurant in the area   what a disappointment!  the services were just terrible   customers standing by the door with plenty of empty tables inside    staff can't be bother   it seems that they don't really need the business  waiters need to call for everything  extra tea  plates  chopsticks etc     many other choices in the area   will not be going back to this one 
the soup dumplings here are a must!  also try their noodle soups and the rice cake dishes 
i came for one thing and one thing only  their xiao long bao   i ordered two portions of xioa long bao since i am allergic to crab well the xiao long bao was good it wasn't super amazing that i would come here for these   they were not really a step above others one thing i notice is that each order comes with six baos instead of the usual eight which was a little of a bummer for me the reason why they got three stars was the horrible service   i finished my tea before they even bought my order   then two waitress bought food and none of them offer to refill my drink   then i asked for hot sauce and one of them claim they would be back   they never came back with my hot sauce 
i love soup dumplings   in particular  those from joe's shanghai (*note* the chinatown location is better and cheaper than the midtown west location)   however  i keep worrying that perhaps joe's shanghai is a tourist trap  which has led me to believe i need to investigate other options   so  on a cold saturday night  i ventured all the way out to flushing to try the pork and crab + pork soup dumplings at nan xiang dumpling house   although i was very concerned by the "c" rating from the health department on the front door  i (perhaps stupidly) decided to try them anyway   man  what a let down   joe's shanghai continues to rule supreme (for the dumplings  at least   i haven't tried any of the other items at either place)   the dumplings at nan xiang dumpling house are not hot enough  the skin is far too thick  and the flavor is just so so   everything about the dumplings at joe's shanghai is vastly superior   also  the hot tea at joe's shanghai is wonderful  whereas the tea here tasted so metallic that i felt as if it was numbing my throat   i definitely would not trek all the way here again; in fact  i don't think i'd eat here again even if i was in the area already 
pretty decent soup dumplings at wallet friendly prices! their zha ziang mian is pretty good too  would come back from more!
my husband who isnt asian    went with my father and i for lunch   he enjoyed his juicy buns and he enjoyed his apps    but this place i believe has expanded    ive been to this place both when it was tiny tiny and bigger and each time we had to wait   i guess juicy buns are in great demand!
my chinese immigrant ex gf introduced me to this place   it's heavily frequented by asians as their main clientele but the dumplings are to die for and are infinitely better than joe's shanghai   the soup dumplings are soo good that it was worth me taking 40 minutes to get there from midtown manhattan   the skin is delicate but the insides are juicy and until i learned how to properly eat them  i would make a mess   i miss this place since i live 700 miles away and have yet to find a place near me that makes it  so if you're on the fence  get here and order some goddamn soup dumplings 
very nice soup dumplings  but not worth making the trip from manhattan or brooklyn just for them   i think joe's shangai are probably just as delicious  and for me  closer 
having a bad day? no worries  just stop and get yourself here  there's food coma therapy  and then there's xiao long bao aka soup dumpling therapy  i was a long time believer that laughter is the best cure for any non physical ailment  after coming to nan xiang dumpling house  i stand corrected  these little mouthfuls of heaven must have been touched with some sort of divine healing elixir  back in my college days  there was more than one night  where a few friends and i would rent a car and come out here just for these dumplings  if you're coming here  expect a wait  if you're driving in  drop the passengers off first to grab a table  while you go find parking (you'll have plenty of time)  it's usually not too long; on average  it's usually a 25 minute wait for a table of 4  the place is designed for efficiency  nothing too fancy inside; you come here to eat  i tend to frequent this establishment with a certain snorlax like friend  our appetites combined   a force to be reckoned with  appetizer wise  our usual favorites are the scallion pancakes  spicy beef & tripe (my personal favorite)  and fried shanghainese udon noodles  then    we get to stackinggg! i usually aim for 3 steamed tray fulls (there's 6 in each tray)  if you're a light eater  i'd recommend anywhere from 6 12 (1 2 trays) soup dumplings  we usually get an even split of the crab flavored ones and the normal pork flavored ones  when i see our order of stacks being carried over by our waiter (so much respect for them  their faces are usually completely hidden by the stacked crates of soup dumplings  takes some real talent to know where they're walking)  my eyes light up like christmas lights  before we found this place  i used to go with my family to joe shanghai for soup dumplings  although they're not bad  the experience you have eating the ones here is completely different  every single dumpling tastes as good as the first one  they possibly even get better    you cannot explain that  it is sorcery  at most other places  the first 5 or so will be delicious  but i tend to get rather tired of it sooner or later  perhaps it's because these dumplings don't feel as heavy or taste as greasy? bleh  can't explain the inexplicable    the only thing that will stop you from eating a thousand of these is that your stomach is sadly too small to contain them just as the dumplings get better with each bite    so will your day  i guarantee it! quick tidbit  all the restaurants on this block are owned by the same owner  if you per chance visit any of his other establishments  you can kindly request for them to send over some soup dumplings as well  =]
best soup dumpling spot in flushing actually in nyc! other than that we really like the beef and chili peppers over noodles  it starts getting crowded before lunch especially on the weekends! best time to go is either really early am or weeknight for dinner 
the food here was heaven   not sure what else i can say about it   just be prepared for a busy  somewhat loud experience when you get here but don't fret  the food will make all that go away   )
"soup dumplings? on a cold day? gee willickers  that would rustle my jimmies!"i was foolish to think that just a steamed pork bun at a chinese bakery would stop my raging appetite post blood donation  to that end  it was time to consult the yelp app to see what places in flushing i needed to knock off my ever growing bookmarks list  and it seems half my friends have been here      and so  our brave hero came to nan xiang  promptly seated at a table with a few random asian teenagers and handed a cup of hot tea  an order of pork soup dumplings and a scallion pancake were ordered the scallion pancake was crispy and fluffy  not the best one i've had  but pretty good (i think it was just the plain one   didn't taste any beef in it)  the chili sauce on the table definitely helped  to be fair the soup dumplings are  as you've probably gathered from other reviews  fantastic  the dough has the perfect consistency   tough enough to not break instantly  yet soft enough so you can be a vampire and drain them of the delicious broth inside  the meat was tender and flavorful  i'm sure the teenagers next to me were bewildered by my tenacity at attacking the soup dumplings  you get 6 with your order  and they're pretty hefty too prices are alright   the whole meal cost $9 20  service was fairly fast  it seems that early afternoon on a weekday was the right time to go here  since it was busy but not packed are they the best soup dumplings? i'm not sure   i'll need to do more "gastronomic investigation" to decide   but nan xiang is definitely high on the list for me at this point 
this is one of those places that has gotten way too popular  i normally hate going to flushing or chinatown  but the xiao long bao here is just so good and everyone else likes it  the menu has typical shanghai food like scallion pancakes and soup dumplings  pretty much everyone i know will get these two along with something else  i normally only eat this and occasionally the deep fried buns  which are really good but also seem really unhealthy  i think that the food here is probably the best out of any shanghainese place in the city  and is priced fairly reasonably the main issue with this place is the wait  even though i know nyc places can get crowded once they become popular  this has to be something else  i expect expensive places to have crowds like this  not some fairly cheap place in flushing of all places  every time i've come here there's always been a wait of at least 20 minutes  normally i don't mind  but the space is so cramped that waiting for even small amounts of time is such a pain  with people constantly walking past you  if you can tolerate the wait  the food is definitely worth it  just be prepared to wait a long time  even in the mid afternoon at 2pm or so 
dump him  just dump him in the trash can and never look back  i know joe meant a lot  he meant a lot to me too  his little soup dumplings  prime chinatown location  celebrity on the wall fame    we had a good run  for a whole year i really thought he was the best in the area as well    but some things just aren't meant to be the soup dumplings are better here  especially the crab one  you really feel like you are eating crab  dumplings come a little bit slower    but i am ok with that  the appetizers are delicious  cucumber with gahh lic!! marinated perfectly  stir fried noodles were delicious  scallion pancakes were minimally oily  delicious  give yourself the strength to get to flushing and realize what you have been missing in your heart and your stomach this entire time  it's never too late  never too late 
don't get me wrong  the food is amazing here  the only eyesore and frustration is the (fugly b*tch) cashier named "fei" (saw this on the receipt  not sure if that's her real unfortunate name)  i'd never seen such horrendous service to a customer until tonight  she first told me in a rude tone to order everything at one time because she could only enter once; then she yelled at me for not using the "full name of the item" and for ordering things she already told me they ran out; then she asked me to enunciate each item (guess her hearing is compromised by her temper) and when i did she made fun of me  i don't live in flushing  so i was here just for the food; otherwise i would have stormed out immediately  i just wanna say  "i know you may hate your life  but treat your customers well  you can't survive in the restaurant service scene if you are a d ou che bag  period "
i have to agree with most reviews that this is the best xiao long bao place in nyc this place is definitely way better than joe shanghai's!been going for quite some time now and honestly the xlb are the only item on the menu that i actually really like but since this is what they are known for its gets them 4 stars in my book  all the other things i've tried are average and tend to be on the greasy side  they took over and renovated the adjoining restaurant some months ago so there is almost double the seating now so waiting isn't as long as before  still the restaurant feels really cramped since they squeeze in as many tables and chairs as possible  servers are often forgetful and unapologetic when you've asked for something for the 10th time 
after having a terrible craving for soup dumplings  i decided to trek to main street and try this place  i don't know why i was surprised to find that they only accepted cash but as usual i didn't have any on me and was forced to walk back a few blocks and use the atm  since my craving was strong  i didn't mind going back because i was sure that these dumplings were going to be worth it  cash in hand  i enter the restaurant and put in my order for sesame pancakes  veggie dumplings  pork dumplings  and the crispy chicken noodle  the pancake and noodles came out sporadically and they were both pretty good  the sesame pancake was phenomenal and on several occasions i've day dreamed about them  the noodles were decent but they were swimming in sauce  it was just way too much for me but i still enjoyed it  i paced myself with these items because i was still waiting for my dumplings  i waited and waited and waited and politely asked a few servers about the status of my order but nothing came  every table around me got their dumplings and all of them had arrived after me  finally after asking for the 1000th time  i got my order    cold  it was frustrating and disappointing  they waitress apologized and said the order got lost but to be honest  it was really a big let down  the "soup" part of the dumpling had already disappeared and i could only eat 1 and let the rest go  i really really wanted to love this place  i overlooked the cash only thing  the sporadic arrival of my food  and the long wait because i really wanted to savor the broth in the dumplings but i wasn't able to  this place was good over all but the bad experience has made it so i will not return 
this place's food is pretty good  totally recommended  but be aware!!!! since they're really busy their service might not be the best one you'll experience! but definitely go for the food!!!!!
first place i had ever been to in flushing  great place with very good pricing the food was so cheap and so tasty that our group ordered maybe 6 dishes for only 3 people we of course got the famous xiao long bao and it was delicious  we also had some beef wrapped in scallion pancakes which was also great  however for some it may be a bit too flavorful with the sauce but for me it was great service was pretty decent considering how cheap the food was  would def go again  top places in flushing 
i've never had soup dumplings before and i'm in love! i came here on a thursday night around 11pm  we placed an order for the dumplings and the spicy beef tendon  i'm not a great fan of cold meat dishes but i tried it and the flavor was good  the pork and crab dumplings will be on my list of top ten favorite things  i added a little vinegar and pepper and it was amazing! can't wait to bring my dad here when he comes to visit!!! there are michelin guide ratings in the window for good reason  coming here is a must!!!
when you see a line that is always a sure sign you find the place to be  combine this line with the rave reviews that total a four star average from 1200 yelper a and you start to set some expectations  i have to admit when we saw a "c" health inspection rating form the window  i was hesitant to continue waiting    i still had the latest news of violations that closed joe's still fresh on the brain  after hemming and hawing  we decided to risk it  our wait was probably a solid 49 minutes on a saturday  once we were seated we quickly ordered crispy noodles with chicken  the pork soup dumplings and sliced beef scallion pancake  everything was really really good  i wish there was a side of rice i could have ordered for the noodles as the sauce was a tad salty for me to eat alone but the flavors were really full and delicious  the pancake was crispy and we loved how the dumplings were so juicy! we also appreciated that they were so accommodating to our requests  i wish our server could have stopped by a few times  but thy were prompt to address is if we flagged them down  i totally agree the food is on par or even better than some really well known names and really appreciate the treasure this hole in the wall embodies  the touches were so cheap our bill for the three dishes came out to be about 29 bucks  and we were full  well worth the trip to queens and glad we got to try it  now if only their safetyinspection rating can get back up to an a    
best southern style noodles  fried dumplings  fried rice cakes place  they have most common southern style chinese breakfast  the xiao long bao is not the best in my opinion since i been to nan xiang and had xiao long bao there  it's pretty good but not authentic enough  the fried rice cake and fried dumplings are really good 
my absolute favorite place to get soup dumplings  i always get the pork over the crab (not a big fan of the crab flavor)  there is plenty of soup in each dumpling  which i enjoy  and though there isn't too much flavor in the pork  a little bit of soy sauce can fix that  after i am full  there is something about it that leaves me craving for more this place is cash only and does get very busy so unless you come at off peak hours  don't come on an empty stomach 
as different as this place is from the shanghai counterpart  the food  where it matters  is identical  i don't know if the nan xiang here is at all related to the tourist trap in shanghai that caters nearly exclusively to domestic and japanese tourists  everyone here seemed to be from new york  but it begs you to order its soup dumplings in the same way right in the middle of the dining area is the kitchen where they hand roll the skins and hand stuff the filling  assembly line style  the product is as good as you would expect fresh  made from scratch dumplings to taste  soup dumplings (xlb) are not my favorite food in the world  and i think maybe they're a bit over scrutinized  i visited joe's shanghai in chinatown in the same trip and i really couldn't tell the difference  i much prefer the no nonsense attitude here though  there's no pretending to be a restaurant going on; it's xlb and small dishes only 
i stumbled in this place after having walked around a nearby neighborhood and used yelp's nearby search for some decent chinese food  my only regret is that i came here with my kosher husband with whom i feel super guilty eating shellfish in front of  so i made the super  super stupid mistake of not ordering any dumplings  well  if they had a sole crab meat one  i could have  but almost all their dumplings had pork in them and i wasn't in the mood to go vegetarian  stop staring and give me hug  i need one  i gave up pork back in may  i'm still traumatized instead  he got a seafood noodle soup and i waited forever (and ever  and ever) for rice cake with beef shredded chicken (what kind of idiot orders a rice cake dish at a restaurant does dumplings?)  the rice cakes were a disappointment and by the time i finished  i wasn't hungry to try anything else  the 3 star rating is for their non dumpling food  but based on what i smelled and what everyone else ordered  i'm sure the star rating would go up if i'd ordered dumplings  service is as most people mentioned  pretty laissez faire   borderline rude we don't care about you  i hope to return 
a casual fast food house serving soup dumplings that are second to none   other food choices to satisfy your culinary desire for shanghai like delicacies are scallion pancakes and pan fried udon  try the cold dished fried bean gluten and give your palate a jolt with the spicy beef and tripe   come to eat but don't expect to be pampered   cash only 
my experience with soup dumplings is limited  it's pretty much just shangai cafe for me  which i happen to be very fond of  i'm almost never in flushing so i don't get to be treated to deliciousness like this too often i won some cool points with my friend for knowing how to eat these (and get them out of the steamer) without breaking them  it's not that hard  honestly  i don't know what i can say that hasn't already been said  they're wonderfully made  full of delicious soupy goodness  and worth every penny  the service could stand to be a bit more attentive  though  i've never seen staff so reluctant to take money  then  when my friend took some of the leftover dumplings to go  they were literally tossed on the table  not cool  it's 3 star service of 5 star dumplings  if i were in flushing  i'd grab some  but you won't find me trekking out here from brooklyn too often 
everything's made fresh to order! can't get any better than that! the food is amazingly delicious! can i be anymore excited about this place? no! it's that good  trust me  you have to go!!!!i had their xiao long bao and fresh made soy milk  let's just say i was in a really happy place after that  done note though  it gets crowded really fast so go early or during off times 
nice dumplings  but i wouldn't go out of my way to get it   their noodle dish was average   scallion pancakes were doughy and a bit greasy 
tasty  much better than joe's but i'm not sure it's worth the one hour wait (20 min to get seated  30+ min to cook the buns??)   the lady told us order fast and eat fast but she was nice in checking on my to go order   it is overwhelmingly inefficient in that place   there are three areas of seating but just a 10x10 kitchen!
after a surprisingly short wait (around 10 minutes) during the sunday lunch crunch  we were seated at a table for 2  immediately ordered +shanghai style noodles with seafood (yum   a large plate for $10)+scallion pancake with beef (the best thing we had   chewy  saucy  just the right amount of beef)+xlb pork+xlb pork & crab+warm soy milk bowl (what's not to like?)the xlb were ok  not great  not amazing  the skin is on the thicker side  and while there's a ton of soup in the dumplings  it isn't very flavorful   and neither is the meat  i usually scarf down a pan by myself before slowing down  but with the xlb here  i was done after just a few  i wouldn't go out of the way to have these  service is efficient but pleasant (and we did not speak any chinese)  parking's painful but there's a few garages a block or two away (apart from the small municipal lot) that are pretty inexpensive ($6 for 2 hours) 
3 5 the xlbs were good  but not the best i've had  sliced pig ear was mediocre   needed more seasoning  salted soy milk was actually really good  probably the thing i liked the most here overall  i'm not sure i would trek all the way out here again for this place 
the most stupid waiter & the slowest service i ever had in my whole life  the server even judged my bf & my behaviors?! are u kidding me? the quality of their soup dumplings are even getting worse and worse with every time i went there  u can also find very authentic and good soup dumplings in other places in this city anyway  why u still need to go to this place to tolerate the most arrogant waiter & the slowest service?!
most of the negative reviews here are from non asians!! come on really??? what do they know about chinese asian food?? nina r doesnt even know what shes talking about when it comes to soup dumplings! lol
very poor attitude  we went in and told them how many we have  they just said wait a bit  but actually it's all full and no table available the bitch at the front is so shit face the whole time  but the other side of the restaurant was all empty  maybe they're famous now so they don't mind not doing more business? opening another table is too troublesome? then that's fine  we don't need to go there anymore 
service was bad from the moment we walked in  they took about 5 minutes to clean off empty tables to seat us after the lunch rush  the waiter only filled 2 out of 3 cups  the waiter failed to write down our order and hence forgot half of it  i rarely give 0 tip  but this was one case that 0 was deserved even if basing the review on the food quality alone  i would rate it below average compare to equivalent restaurants that i have had in los angeles (my town)  the soy milk tasted a little bit more above warm water  there was no flavor in the soup of the siu long bao  not much flavor in the beef pancake either 
i came here and ordered 4 things salty soybean milki ordered the salty soybean milk to try it after reading the reviews on here  gross  i had no idea what was in it   i tried to eat it and it was okay  but i found something that looked like a hair   i asked the waitress to take a look and she said it was shrimp hair   she wouldn't take it back   i guess i should have done my research to know that the salty soy was listed under breakfast and would contain shrimp   i don't care what it is  but it killed my appetite   i should have known  most american restaurants would take stuff back even if it wasn't a human hair just as a gesture of good faith  but i had a waiter at another restaurant say that the worm found in my spinach was edible   this restaurant is no different  spicy wonton   this was like dumplings that sat in a bowl full of spicy sesame oil and peanut sauce   it was like satay sauce  okay  but it wasn't very appetizing pan friend udon   this was okay  but still not that good  soup dumplings   okay  but not as piping hot and good as joe shanghai'sjoe shanghai's is still king in my book 
i love soup dumpling  and raccomend to take scallion pancake you will not regret !!!!you will love
truly delicious soup dumplings  two people can pig out for a total of $20 + tip  if you're new to this world  eating here can get confusing  so a few suggestions   for starters  we went yesterday    saturday    and dreaded waiting on line  but we got there at about 3 30 and were seated within 15 minutes  by 4 p m   the tables were turning over at 5 minute intervals  remember  this place is cash only!now  the food    the soup dumplings are listed as "dim sum " the top picks are either  pork or pork and crabmeat  you don't need to taste both  one type is enough  if you're not allergic to shellfish  the crabmeat version has a little more flavor  and for two people  one order can be enough; there's tons of other stuff to eat here  the soy milk soups are hot broths that are slightly coagulated    on their way to becoming tofu but not that dense yet   we had one bowl of the salty savory version  which was great  next time  will try a sweet one the scallion pancakes are like none i've ever had  they're fried to a golden crispy crust; would be very tasty with a side dish  watching the chinese couple next to me  i know how i would eat here next time  for two people  i'd do a soy milk soup  the scallion pancakes  a noodle dish  one order of pork and crabmeat dumplings  at several tables filled with chinese diners  i noticed a certain sized bowl  when i asked the waitress what these people were having  she said it was the chicken soup  so we'll try that next time too 
apparently there is a east coast  west coast rivalry thing going on here between nan xiang and joe shanghai  i hate to say it but when it comes to soup dumplings  nan xiang wins it hands down in my opinion  the skin is thinner and the soup is lighter and much cleaner tasting  the only problem is    i did not enjoy anything else that i tried here  i came here a few times and got the items that i usually order at other restaurants and did not enjoy any of them  ugh! how i wish i could find something else that i really enjoy so that i can keep coming here and have more than just soup dumplings  but yeah that was not the case 
their dumplings are perfectly made  the dough is firm enough to hold the meat and juices but soft enough to just pierce and dump in the vinegar sauce beef noodle soup was absolutely wonderful! noodles were soft and chewy  broth was very flavorful!fresh soybean drink was smooth  it help cut the richness from the dumplings and beef noodle soup also had pickled cucumbers which were so delicious and refreshing!
juicy xiao long (don't you toss out a generic term for a specific food)  thin skin  relatively fast (despite barely minimum) service   xiao long is satisfying for the craving  although the flavor is not exactly what you would get in shanghai or wu xi due to the regulatory requirements for meat products be aware of the greasy soup in the xiao long in terms of temperature (burningly hot)  and calories (jan  is still the month to implement the new year resolution)   drink up the dipping sauce to off set the grease  and the slices of ginger is pretty tasty and healthy too!bon appetite~
the food is terrific  i absolutely love the lobster blt   so it pains me to complain but i felt compelled after my experience at madison square park eats   i made a beeline for the lobster pound stand and found the menu listing the blt at $12  up from the $10 it was just last fall  sucks but not the worst thing ever  prices rise   but once i was charged for it  the server said it was $13 06   that was ugly  the hidden charge for tax plus it being a crooked number added four dollars to the mental experience  since i was expecting it to be 10    the  06 essentially makes it 14 because who wants to carry 94 cents and what can you do with it anyway?  tell me what it costs and i'll pay  don't trick me which makes me feel you are trying to take advantage and pull a fast one over on me (and other customers)  the disingenuous nature of nickel and dime philosophy left the proverbial bad taste in my mouth   which doesn't supersede the great taste of the food however it definitely will preclude me from being a repeat customer and will mean when next time comes  i only get one adding to the unpleasant service was when i called the brooklyn location hoping to express my feedback  i got voicemail saying they'd love to speak with me but were too busy don't get too big for your britches there  lobster pound   you have begun driving away a huge fan 
authentic and satisfying good food at a fair price  comfortable seating when it is not crowded the food here meets my expectations of a traditional meal  give them a try 
i really  really  really wanted to love this place  i've heard so many good things about this place  so i came here expecting xiao long bao that would blow me out of my mind  but i was very disappointed  it wasn't that it was bad  but it wasn't anything really special either  heck  i think joe's shangai's xlb was better (back in the day    now it's just    bleh)  maybe it was just a bad day for them  maybe not  but i couldn't really see what the hype about this place was the service is anywhere from meh to none  what do you expect from a place run by chinese people? the waiter forgot to serve us tea until about 10 minutes after we ordered  i guess one good thing about this place is that i didn't feel rushed  even though there was a super long line outside the restaurant  anyways  the rest of the things we ordered were pretty decent  nothing mind blowing though  heck  i don't really see the difference between the food served here and other places in flushing  i might come back another time to try their xlb again  but it probably won't be soon 
i had another great meal here today  maybe the best yet  they've opened up another dining room to the right  so there's more space and less of a wait  we also got a good table with plenty of space  i didn't feel crammed like i sometimes do  it's also nice to get hot tea poured right away after coming in from the rainy cold the food was superb as usual  consistency is the major strength of this place  we ordered pork soup dumplings  shao mai  vegetable noodle soup  and beef and scallion pancake  the pork soup dumplings have a delicious  distinct salty and savory flavor  the shao mai are filled with a sticky rice mixture and are heartier than i expected  the vegetable noodle soup is probably the best soup you can get here because it's just chock full of vegetables like bok choy  several kinds of mushroom  sliced bean curd  etc  the beef and scallion pancake is crispy and flavorful  made complete with a mouthwatering  sweet and savory hoisin sauce the two factors keeping this place from a perfect score are the service and the cleanliness  though neither are so miserable to warrant a poor rating  the first thing you're likely to notice here is that your table is wet or sticky  or that there are crumbs or other little morsels hanging out on your table  i understand that it's a very popular restaurant  but i think most people wouldn't mind waiting another 10 seconds so that their tables can be properly cleaned before they're seated  this has been a problem every time i've gone  the other recurring problem is that it's hard to get the attention of the servers  especially when trying to get the check  by the time we were ready to leave today  the restaurant was half empty  and the servers were doing small tasks in the kitchen area  even when one of them came out to do something  they never even looked my way for almost 10 minutes  we also never got a tea refill the entire time until we asked for it with the check  i also get the impression that the servers are usually in a bad mood by the manner in which they talk to us and drop the plates on the table while looking elsewhere  improvements in these areas would make for a stellar restaurant  though i guess they have little incentive to improve since they're so popular and operating over capacity almost every day since the food is so cheap and consistently delicious  i'm likely to keep coming back here again and again when i go out to flushing  nan xiang is worth the trip 
the soup dumplings were above average and the house special rice cake tasted decent  the waiters speak extremely poor english (it was a point on the menu to order kind of situation)  restaurant is extremely dirty try joe shanghai down the block instead  will probably not be back 
extremely disappointed  i've been here a couple times over the years and it's always been good  however  i went here today for lunch  waited about 20 min for 2  we ordered garlic cucumber  seafood crispy noodle  2 crab meat soup dumplings and scallion pancakes  the garlic cucumber was limp and did not taste fresh  the seafood crispy noodle was not crispy and looked severely undercooked compared to our neighbors which came out at the same time  the scallion pancakes were good i guess but missing sauce  i've been waiting for the past hour for soup dumpling  we finished all our food and we are full  but we came here for soup dumplings  i cancelled 1 order and got an attitude from the waitress about it  there was very poor communication involved (not language barrier related) they keep telling us it's almost done  but we have been here for over an hour  i'm used to my soup dumplings i guess i'll just go to joe's shanghai next time  tldr; soup dumplings took over an hour to come out and now i'm full and sad and full of sadness
wow  they've engulfed their neighbors' storefronts and have now tripled their original capacity  and yet you're still gonna wait for your soup dumplings  do it  it's worth the wait i like to show up before 10am on saturdays and order my soup dumplings before the waitress can ask  they take some time but due to the expected turnover  it isn't "made to order" per se  on a real busy day  you may wait about 15 minutes for your dumplings  but if you catch them early enough  you'll snag yours in 5 what else is good here? well  everything else is circumstancial  but done right   you'll enjoy their potsticker dumplings and their scallion pancakes 
great food !!!! huge portions and so inexpensive  parking sucks since it is in flushing but it's worth it  i will definitely be going back soon 
well  i finally went back but this time around  food was just ok   we got scallion pancake with beef  shu mai  vegetable dumplings which i didn't care for at all  we also got soup dumpling as last time and cucumber abs garlic  i love the latter dish  in fact  that was the best of all  i think i overrated this place last time!
overrated place   the xiaolongbao isn't from shanghai the wonton soup is used to be good but now it's average 3 star fair   if you ever had the real wonton and xiaolongbao  you may rate it two 
best in town  home taste  especially the salt soya milk  totally reminds me of shanghai 
i have come here about three times now  twice for take out and once to dine in  every time has been awesome  staff is really friendly  food is great  the scallion pancakes should come with a different sauce though  it normally (everywhere else i've been) has come with a little sweeter sauce or something not the same sauce for the buns  also parking is a bit difficult but all in all great place! glad i found them!
the soup dumpling is still pretty good  we always order the regular one  and the vegetable one is good too  we tried their noodles  was ok; the breakfast menu is more tasty  salty soy milk  and beef pancake is good 
great xiao long bao  as everyone else has noted  they are definitely larger than usual  and don't fall apart too easily  the soup is also very very soothing and the meat is soft and flavorful  the skin isn't hard and tough like it can be in other xiao long bao i've had  the other stuff is okay too  i've had the scallion pancake and the soup noodles there  the pancake was kind of dry  though i might have just felt that because i really wasn't very hungry that day and didn't feel like eating  the vegetable soup noodles were good  although the soup was on the oily side there also weren't that many noodles (mostly soup  which i barely touched)  service is very good  they actually filled up my tea! a bit pricey for flushing   expect to spend more than 10 dollars for lunch  not including tip  and they even charge tax! i guess you could just do one order of xiao long bao for a meal (6 pieces)  which  in retrospect probably isn't a bad idea since i was pretty satisfied already by the time i was done with those   they really are pretty big  i've seen people just order that and some soy milk as a meal 
not a fan  the cook wasn't from shanghai  really lots of people  i have very mediocre service    the server kind of pushed me and my friend  the food was ok  won't come back  a taste of shanghai right situated the sheraton hotel was way better than this 
delicious  spicy beef tendon  spicy beef tripe  sweet hot soy milk  udon stir fry  crab meat soup dumplings reign over the pork soup dumplings   good value 
this is one of my favorite restaurants in flushing  i have no complaints about this place  it's small but we never have to wait for a table woot! their shanghai dumplings are amazingly good! i think you only get 6 pieces when most places serve 8  so i advise you to order x2! it comes out steamy hot be careful  how to handle the shanghai dumplings 1  using the tongs gently place a dumpling on a spoon 2  poke it with your chopsticks  fork  whatever you can find to avoid burning yourself 3  allow the soup to flow onto the spoon 4  blow to cool and drink soup 5  add vinegar using the tiny spoon that comes with the vinegar to the dumpling 6  now enjoy the remainder of the dumpling also  their beef pancakes are delicious! take my word and try it! the way they make the pancake is very different from most places  not the thick flour type of bread you get  and rather it is thinner and crispy  the soymilk is great here too  very refreshing  i've tried many of their noodles and rice cake dishes and it was always consistently good  i really like their pan fried noodles  you really can't go wrong with any item on the menu 
all the food was great  especially the soup dumplings! the people there were polite and there wasn't much to complain about  would definally recommend going there if you havent already!
they must have had an off day when i went cuz i did not enjoy my meal or the service we ordered 5 xlb  3 of which were placed in front of me hubby and a friend at a table  we had a bunch of kids with us so needless to say we were distracted  i see the tall waiter check each holder then grab all three bamboo holders and leave  i asked the guys if we finished all of them and they said no so about 3 min later  we see the waiter casually stroll back out with an order of xlb  offering it to another table? they shook their heads and my friend went up to him and called him out in front of the entire rest saying that the full order that was completely untouched was ours  what a shady mofo   not sure what he was trying to do  we also ordered jellyfish (its different than your avg jellyfish so i liked it   one star for that)  spicy beef tripe which i heard was good and scallion pancake which was also just ok  one of the kids thought it was a cheese sandwich! lolwe also got seafood fried noodles (the one at joe's is def more legit than the plate i was presented with)  their noodles (in canto  "leurng meen wong") isn't supposed to be the same noodles as pan fried noodles  it should look like fried longevity noodles  also  their seafood only consisted of fish and shrimp  where the squid and scallops at man? cheapos! their chicken rice cakes were also just ok  i was scrounging around for the chicken pieces to feed my son and probably only found 5 at most  and they were the size of mini cheez doodles  sad we also ordered a shanghai noodle but i guess i can't comment on that since my order wasn't placed and food never arrived  blah =o 
you know you can't be asian and not love dumplings "with soup "  when i realized how  close we were to this dumpling house from new york hall of science i got very excited  we were on a mission to get here  and we arrived hungry  cold  and famished  we were very happy to be promptly served with hot tea  very welcomed on a cold  windy day!!!  next  i couldn't resist and basically ordered one of everything  my son remarked how much we were ordering and i said  "no fear  it will be consumed!"  and we did!!! we had between the three of us 1 order of pork dumpling w soup  1 order of crab pork dumpling  vegetable dumpling  vegetable noodle soup  wonton vegetable soup  scallion pancakes and an order of edamame tofu mustard greens  it was all mouth watering delicious  all the dishes were memorable  although i do want to especially mention the vegetable noodle soup which for $5 95 i was not expecting much  what came was a giant bowl of filled with noodles  vegetables  and the stock flavorful  tasting like mushroom  that in itself was plenty as a meal  needless to say we walked away as happy customers and i'm pretty sure a few pounds heavier from all the good eating!!!
god  has this place come a long way  i've been coming here for years  and the transformation has been astounding the soup dumplings are of course the star  they're far better than the ones at joe shanghai  and are made fresh right in front of the store  the noodles aren't bad here either  and the portion is generous nan xiang is as famous for its soup dumplings as it is for its service  before its expansion  the service was rushed and rude  it's gotten better since then  with less stress resulting form the larger restaurant  however  waiters are still hard to flag down for orders  waters  napkins  and whatever else  however  i'd still choose this spot for soup dumplings every day of the week 
our go to food place for late hours    specifically when driving here late from the woodbury outlets  opening late is a plus  food is quite good and yes it is still definitely worth all the way here just for this food 
comparatively one of the best soup dumpling restaurants in flushing since the declining authenticity of the once favored joe's shanghai  these handmade soup dumplings are flavorful and taste very fresh  service is mediocre but the quality of food makes up for that downside  overall  a restaurant that is reliable in taste 
the soup dumpling was good  i was not satisfied with the service there was only like 12 customers in the store but they didn't seat us and so we seated ourselves and after we sat down the wait staff told us to move down  the price was reasonable 
most stuff are greasy and make you gain weight easily  if you don't want to get acid reflux  try to avoid this place 
this place is rather popular  my friends and i had to wait 20 minutes to be seated  it's like trying to get into an elite club in vegas  but the wait was well worth it  we started off with the cucumber salad  it was so refreshing and perfect for the summer  i like how it had tons of garlic and cilantro  it's actually my favorite diet food  the stir fried udon with beef was full of "wok hei (fire from the wok) " although a bit too greasy  it took a while for them to bring out the soup dumplings  so we ordered some beef and tripe to curb our hunger  one of my friend's had no clue what tripe was  so i told her to try it first before i revealed the truth to her  she loved it so much that she forgot to ask what it was  i guess there was no need for me to say anything  the dish spoke for itself  then finally the soup dumplings arrived  omg! they were pipping hot from the steamer and full of juiciness  these dumplings are much better than joe's shanghai  joe's dumplings are way too salty and nan xiang's is just more flavorful and sweet  i'm giving this place 4 stars because i've been spoiled by the real soup dumplings in shanghai  but these are the best that i've tried in the us so far  there is definitely some room for improvement  the skin needs to be more thin and translucent  also  the dumplings need to be served much quicker  but for a total of $43 and a party of five  this place is the best bang for your buck!
after reading all of the yelp reviews and the long lines hype surrounding their dumplings  i have to say i was extremely disappointed  we stopped in for a late brunch saturday afternoon around 2pm  there was still a wait of approx 5 10 mins for a party of 2  that being said  the soup dumplings themselves were the most disappointing  even though  admittedly  they do have more soup than any other soup dumplings i've had including joe's shanghai  that does not necessarily qualify them as better in my opinion  the soup was honestly a bit too much for my liking  the over abundance of soup mixed with the too thin wrapping left most of the soup gone to waste as it spilled out of my spoon  the flavor of the meat filling also lacked taste  the crab ones at least had the upside of real crab meat which improved the taste slightly  but the plain pork ones were just awful i would rather go to joe's shanghai or my absolute favorite (shanghai café)  definitely not worth the hassle of trecking out to flushing for this 
a bit of a wait  but the soup dumplings are worth it!
xlb was very good  not as fatty or salty as the place in jersey where i usually get my fix  we also had the scallion pancake with sliced beef  and though it was very good  i think the beef gave it a sweetness that i wasn't ready for  i prefer my scallion pancake the americanized way  with a salty  vinegary dipping sauce  finally  the fried noodles with chicken were excellent  i really enjoyed the texture  as typical chinese noodles (lo mein  mei fun  etc) are too soft as a dish  i would order this in place of my usual noodle dish if it was available at the local chinese joint  but it's not only downside  it's in flushing  going to have to wait for long pauses in asian food and convince my husband to come here on our way to the beach!
nan shian is that restaurant in flushing that always seems to be packed  whether you pass by during lunchtime on a saturday or dinner time on a wednesday  there always seems to be a group of people waiting outside for a table  just taking a quick glance in the window  you can see that this restaurant is the place to be and lucky for all of us  they've finally expanded into two dining rooms! more soup dumpling goodness to go around  nan shian has the best xiao long bao (soup dumplings) in all of flushing  trust me  i've tried a fair number of places that serve this delicious shanghainese staple and nan shian does it best  the soup dumplings are plump and full of the wonderfully savory  rich  flavorful  fatty soup  they're best eaten hot so dig in once the server places the bamboo steamer in front of you  be careful not to burn yo'self! also  service is a bit slow here so the best thing to do is check out the menu while you're waiting for a table and order once you sit down so you won't delay soup dumpling satisfaction any longer than you have to  the scallion pancakes are very good as well as the beef wrapped scallion pancake  yum! i've also had the rice cakes here  but i didn't enjoy it that much because the rice cakes were a bit undercooked  (though i'm a bit biased    my momma makes the best rice cakes)  you'll get the most for your money at nan shian  come with an empty stomach and be ready to feast!
came on a saturday around 1pm  i think we waited for about 20 minutes for a party of 3  totally worth it  here's what we had worth mentioning and what you should order  steamed pork buns (6) for $6 50  turnip puff (4) for $3 50  and bean curd and minced vegetables cold dish appetizer for $4 50 the steamed pork buns are essentially xiao long baos aka xlb  however  the xl should really stand for xtra large  these babies are so large  they spill over your soup spoon (not unlike a muffin top)  the skin is so soft and completely cooked through  there was so much delicious soup inside  i needed two sips to keep any of it from spilling out!i'm also a sucker for pastries  and the turnip puff was perfectly golden on the outside  cripsy and flaky  what i wouldn't have given to try the red bean puff too!the bean curd and minced vegetables appetizer is refreshing against the hot and steamy bun  don't get the seaweed  too salty  (
awesome xiao long bao  excellent service   for me  its the best place to bring my family for sunday breakfast   come before 9 am on sunday though  it get packed   
maybe one of the best soup dumpling place in flushing   tried most of the cold dishes n it's pretty good  expect to wait along time for tables  
i recently took a soup dumpling tour of flushing  and nan xiang was my first stop  it's a relatively small place  but we were seated immediately  the staff was very helpful and friendly and our order came out promptly  they certainly know why people come there! we got an order of the regular pork xlb and the crabmeat and pork xlb  and of the two the regular pork had a much more flavorful broth and overall had more meat  the crabmeat was hardly noticeable under the flavor of the pork  but it was still tasty  nice portions  too  i think there were 6 dumplings per order  the prices were reasonable  and the atmosphere was casual  definitely worth a stop in!
this restaurant is always busy  and the quality of the food is always great  this is one of the greatest soup dumpling places that i have ever been to  and it's a great date place  none of the food there is overpriced 
this place did not disappoint   the soup dumplings are delicious  and i was impressed by everything else we ordered  too   the rice cake dishes are excellent and the scallion pancakes with beef was amazing 
ordered both kinds of xlb  pork only and crab and pork ones   both were amazing  flavorful  soupy with perfect dough texture and thickness  the noodle soups however  while not bad by any means  were just not up to par flavor wise as the xlb  the broth was a bit weak in depth i'll just stick to their steamed buns next time 
everyone that has been in flushing before knows about this spot   not only can you get the classics like hot soy bean milk and the doughnut at anytime   you also get creative unique dishes like the beef wrapped in scallion pancake drizzled with peking duck sauce     mmmmmm! the soup buns are amazing and come in either pork or half crab  half pork   the one thing that really stood out was the texture of the actual bun in the soup bun   it kept the soup nice and warm and never got soggy and flimsy   a must try for anyone!
ordered soup dumpling and pancake to go  heated in the microwave and it was still very tasty! love it! can't stop eating 
definitely one of the best soup dumplings spots in nyc   place gets very busy  very fast so come early or come when it's not the dinner lunch rush   they will prepare the dumplings as you order  so there will be a wait   you can see the ladies making the dumplings as you come in   order more than you think you want  because the wait would be too long for a second round 
soup dumplings????  yes please   i don't know what else they have there  but i do know that they make some real  amazing  soup dumplings   if your a fan and find yourself in the area i would wait on line and get yourself an order  or two  or even three!!
1 crab 1 pork please! j and i do not share our soup dumplings! they have a much cleaner tasting  sweeter   soup dumplings than joes shanghai but  they give you 2 less   but i have no where else to go to curb my frequent soup dumpling cravings now that joes shanghai and i said our fare wells  my only complaint is that you really have be careful when placing those delicate dumplings on the spoon   they pop so easily here!they have less variety of food to order from than other chinese restaurants but we always order the same thing anyway  4 stars just for  the dumplings and crispy noodle! make sure you ask for crispy noodle   we asked for pan fried noodles out of habit  and ended up with pan fried udon noodles  it was good  just not what we were expecting  i feel like there isn't enough food to choose from or it's just not that great    the noodle soup that everyone in the restaurant seems to order is not good   the soup is not flavorful  beef tendon& tripe was nice and spicy but left a weird bitter numbing  tingly after taste in the mouth  maybe it was just that day or maybe its normal?   but i'm afraid to try it again  too bad    the flavors were good i'm glad they made the space bigger even though they still get packed   more tables to be turned! you know it   cash only
i highly recommend nan xiang dumpling house  the food and the service is great!
this place is always always busy   even at 10 30am! luckily  the wait was never long  they will give you a number and have you wait by the front or outside  just pay attention to what number you are  because the wait staff confuse each other  which is very funny  the waiters are super busy  place your order and if they come back make sure you ask for everything and anything you need  i've been here twice and the dishes are very good and very fresh  they are smaller than average dishes  you don't really get a plate's worth of food  and like most chinese cuisines  lots of stir fry & oil  the popular soup dumplings are very soupy  and imo  not as hot as other soup dumplings  the skin is a little thicker than how i would like it  but the meat is very good  the pan fried dumpling buns are also very tasty 
disappointed by their service and food quality   came here on a rainy day  greeted by waitresses that clearly don't like their job  had to switch tables twice bc she doesn't understand some people just don't like to be sitting next to others when there's an entire restaurant of empty tables  they slap the pot of tea down in misery and never came by to ask again if i would be interested in ordering something  i order the salted cabbage pork noodle soup  it came in with full bowl of oily soup broth  no parsley or scallion greens for garnish  noodle soup tasted full of msg  the two stars is for the handmade noodles that's it! dumplings was another disappointment  thick in skin and crab meat tasted crabby  nothing like a taste of shanghai  i would save my $ and drive 10 minutes down kissena blvd to yu garden for worthy service and food quality 
a chinese friend took me here because it's where her family used to go when she was small  we went about 8pm on a rainy sunday night and got parking in the municipal lot across the street   the restaurant was almost empty and we got seated immediately  they give you a pot of tea when you sit down i let her order everything (most of which i would not have ordered by myself)  and we had xiao long bao (which they call "steamed crabmeat and pork buns" on the menu)  and the fried bean gluten (which sounded absolutely awful but)  was  next to the dumplings  the most delicious dish we had  they didn't have any jelly fish that night  but we also ordered the scallion pancakes and a noodle scallion (noodle with scallion sauce??) dish that was in light brown oil   the noodles were too oily and not flavorful to me  the scallion pancake was also mild and not as flavorful as i had expected  it was more like an omelette than a pancake  i've found i often like new foods better the second time i try them so i would try this again now that i know what to expect   the xiao long bao were wonderful and i enjoyed the delicacy of the noodle wrapper and the delicious broth and meat inside  they serve them with shredded ginger in soy vinegar (? i think) sauce and we asked for more of the ginger soy condiment because we both liked them in the dumplings so much  it's quite an art to eat them and she laughingly said your skill at eating them shows by how little broth is on your dish at the end (instead of in your stomach)   at joe's shanghai they serve 8 per order and the dumpling wrapper looked much thicker so i have yet to try xiao long bao there   i loved these dumplings and will definitely go back for more 
after weeks of seeing lines out the door  i decided to go and check this place out   my brother and i got there at like 10am or something so there was zero wait (yay!)   i started with the soy bean milk (slightly burnt   boo!) and the fried dough stick (yum but oily)   we proceeded to have 2 orders of the pork and one order of the crab soupy dumplings   i like that they make the soupy dumpling skins there   fresh and a good compliment to the meat inside   the crab was not worth it (i think joe's shanghai is better)   the pork soupy dumpling's yummy so i think maybe it's worth the wait if you don't go during weird hours   not sure    i might say something different if i had to wait more than 15 min for a table in flushing 
their foods are ordinary and nothing is really special at all  honestly  nothing motivates me to go again   many people go there just because it has over a thousand reviews on yelp 
the best xiao long baos i have ever  eatenwhen it comes to soup dumplings nan xiangs is as good as it gets though a little on the expensive side compared to other soup dumpling restaurants it is well worth the price if quality is what you are looking for i ordered the crab with pork  pork soup dumplings  and the pan fried dumplings on my delightful excursion to this wonderful haven and i was not disapointed with any items ordered that  the soup dumplings were topnotch   the soup was light yet flavorful with enough fat and broth to get a full rich taste without the groggy feeling that one  would get eating  a heavy meal  the meat was soft and  literally melt in your mouth as you dove into and tasted these wonderful treasures  even  the vingar with ginger was  superb  for  they put a little bit of sugar  to give the dipping sauce a sweeter less sour taste  this  is  hands  down the best place for xiao long baos every little detail of this food item was perfect and no other restaurant to my knowledge can replicate the kind of excellence that they  have at nan xiangs lets hope they  stay in business for a long long time
this is one of my favorite places in ny  the price is amazing and their soup dumplings are on point    this place has an a sanitary inspection grade from the department of health and mental hygiene  nuff said there    their soup dumplings are soooooo gooooooooood  if you pick them up from the top slowly  they usually don't rip off from the bottom  still happens once in a while   my other favorite dish is the crispy noodle with shredded chicken  it's one of those addictive dishes that you always have a craving for    like right now   as you talk about it   you start to salivate    overall  i come here for the food  not for the decor (there's not much to say for that) and not for the service (which is pretty ho hum and dry)  i usually do a "dumpling run" around 9 during the week to this place  so i don't really deal with their lines 
this place has hands down the best (pork) soup dumplings i have ever had in my life! normally you'd find maybe one or two shrivel y ones  or ones with less soup  but not these bad boys! they are extra plump and one of the juiciest i've ever tried and i gotta say  i've been to quite a few places  5 stars for their soup dumplings!!despite having the best dumplings  i really hated their shanghai stir fried noodles   it's the worst i've ever had  ( normally this is my go to dish  but this place makes it so dry and bland  i prefer it to be a tad more saucy and am usually use to the darker color of the noodles smothered in sauce! 1 star for this particular dish  but i think i'll give it another go just for the dumplings  ) one can surely work around the noodles!
this review is dedicated to all you sillies who think joe's shanghai has the best soup dumplings in nyc  you are mistaken  very very mistaken  in fact i think that joe's is average joe compared to nan shian (probably more accurately translated as nan xiang?)  nan shian has some of the best soup dumplings i've had  second only to din tai fung in taiwan  if you like soup dumplings  make the trek to flushing and try this place  but prepare to wait  though they recently expanded and the restaurant is now twice as large as it was before  there is still an average 20 40 min wait for a table  after you are seated  make sure to order the soup dumplings right away  there's a 30 min wait for the dumplings to be steamed (from when you order it) but it's worth it! besides  there are plenty of other yummies on the menu to divert your attention for those 30 minutes  my favorite dishes at nan shian are       spicy beef and tripe slices (fu qi fei pian)    stir fried rice cakes with seafood (hai xian chao nian gao)    sliced beef wrapped in pancake (niu rou jia bing )and of course the star of the meal  the xlb featuring thin skins  tender pork  and rich flavorful soup   i've tried both the plain pork soup dumplings and the pork and crab ones  i prefer the pork and crab ones because the soup is a little thicker and i love the flavor that the crab adds  **it was brought to my attention that not everyone knows how to eat a soup dumpling without making a mess  so without further ado  i present to you the simple guide to eating a soup dumpling first use the provided tongs to pinch the top part of the soup dumpling and lift slowly and gently so that you don't rip the dumpling skin  once you have successfully transported your soup dumpling from the tray to your spoon  you can pat yourself on the back because the hard part is over  now  bite a small hole in the top of your soup dumpling and suck out the juices  if you're afraid of burning your tongue  you can dump out the juices into your spoon after biting a hole in the top  then  after enjoying the hot soup  drizzle a little sauce and ginger on top of the dumpling and eat up!
lovely dumpling  unfortunately their service is not so great  quite slow  unfortunately it is cash only  it is worth if you are in the area (flushing center)   i asked for water with ice and they didn't have the ice    so i asked for a beer       and they had only warm beer!!! crazy     at least the green tea (complimentary ) is good  and healty choice!!!! ah ah ah
you i came here on a double date after all the rumor  we waited a very long time to get a seat and we ordered our apps  after sitting down it took 20 min just to get some soy milk and something else  whatever  guess only one thing is prepped here and thats the soup dumplings  i had them and its       whatever  seriously what is the big deal? it wasn't that i think was affordable either considering what it is  me and my girl never went again  much better asian dishes out there and this is not one of them 
the food at this place is pretty good  most of them anyway  i'm not a pork person but their pork fried buns is one of my favorite  not much else i can say because it's a good place but just not that good  and on top of that their service here and their staff is only two star at the most  staff here is not that friendly and it always feels like they're trying to rush you out of the restaurant asap     but i think many people have already mentioned that here in the reviews before and i guess the restaurant just don't care
the sanitation score is kind of dismal and the wait is always long and it's a tiny  crowded space    but these are the tastiest soup dumplings in the entire new york area  the prices are reasonable and the service is always friendly  short walk from the 7 train  cash only 
the soup dumplings are good  but sometimes it's inconsistent  when it's good  it's really good  but they churn out so many of these dumplings (and all their other dumplings) in a day that surely they must just be steaming these all day long  i've found that if you sometimes go in too early for dinner on a slow day  you could be eating dumplings made a few hours ago and it just isn't as good  i've had some really mediocre tasting steamers of dumplings on a couple of occasions and some really awesome ones too  other than the soupy dumplings  they also make great steamed vegetable dumplings  the pickled cucumbers are too garlicky for my taste  the kao fu is really greasy but the seasoning is good  their noodle soups are really good and also a great value for a meal  overall  it's a great place to get your dumpling fix  it's worth going if you've never been and worth returning to in my opinion  definitely one of the better soup dumpling places in the city 
great place for xiao long bao  food and service is good 
i won't go anywhere else for soup dumpling after i ate at nan xiang dumpling house  you won't believe after the first bite of the dumpling  it is filled with juicy pork soap inside  i was never a soap dumpling fan  but this place makes the soap dumbling so irresistible only one thing is this place is always busy and you have to wait on the line  i waiting 15 to 20 minutes for my food to show up  if you are starving  you'll need to go somewhere with faster service all in all  this place is good for afternoon meal 
i went here with a bunch of my girlfriends when we were in flushing  my friend introduced me to something called soup dumplings  i was a bit skeptic at first but oh my god were they delicious  where the hell were these in my entire life?!? the crab and pork soup dumpling were so succulent and tasty  p  we also had the beef scallion pancake  woww  trust me this place is the bomb  only thing i didnt like was it was a bit dirty  the spoon they gave us had a stain  the spoon they used to scoop the sauce felt sticky 
this is the last time i come to this place  i understand that this is a busy restaurant and i have been here when it has been busier  but this time i was not the only customer that was irritated at the long wait times for the food arrival  went with my grandpa around 10 30 am  it was packed  but we got seated within minutes  ordered the soy bean milk (cold)  but got a hot order  ordered scallion pancake  and they brought us one with beef  it took another 15 minutes for them to bring the right order  ordered an order of the soup pork dumplings and this took the longest  as a soup dumpling restaurant this item should be one of the first items to arrive  not last  we also ordered the rice cake with shredded chicken  the first time it came out it was cold  hard and inedible  it took an additional 10 minutes for the food to arrive  the waitress' are not friendly and it is difficult to flag them down 
been a long time patron of this place and always loved the food here  saw that there were some complaints about the service but never had any issues before  today however was quite different  no one was being rude or anything but it took over 15 minutes for one order of our soup dumplings to be brought to our table  at the 15 minute mark i had brought it to the waiters attention that we're pretty much done eating everything else and have yet to see our dumplings  he just told us that there's a slight wait on it all the whole serving dumplings to other tables that sat after we did  finally 5 minutes later  i had to remind the same idiot again that we still don't see our food and it's been 20 minutes since the order was placed and he finally went to check on it just to come back to tell us that the order slip was lost and that there will be another 3 minutes before we get the soup dumplings  he did apologize but he could've avoided all of this if he just checked the first time i brought it up  we finally have our dumplings after close to 30 minutes after sitting down  everything else we've ordered is finished and was delicious but now my appetite has been ruined by this long wait for something that should've taken 5 minutes  going back to joe's   
authentic and delicious chinese food! big fan of the jellyfish salad 
these may be one of the best soup dumplings in nyc  i recently came back from a trip to taiwan  where everything tastes better  and i'm still impressed by how close nan xiang's dumplings are to the best  they do a good job of keeping the skin thin and the filling flavorful  i'm a scallion pancake lover  but i have to say that they butcher the taste by overfrying it  the small dishes and some breakfast foods are also delicious and resemble the homeland  i get my haircut in flushing once every 4 5 weeks or so and guess where i visit every time =d
nan xiang  i have shunted aside my love for shanghai cafe for you  o their soup dumplings are really quite spectacular   starting from the outside  and working our way in   the wrapper   thin  but not so thin as to jeopardize any sort of structural integrity   it won't explode if you look at it too hard   i found it pleasantly pliant  and slightly chewy   be careful though  they don't take too kindly to pinching or plucking with tongs or chopsticks the soup   liquid gold  my friends  liquid gold   upon piercing the side of the xiao long boa  rivulets of steaming hot soup come rushing out and into your spoon   admire the glossy sheen of pork fat  let it cool for a few seconds  and tip it back   it's velvety  voluptuous and savory   it tastes cleanly and straightforwardly of pork   not too fatty  and not too sweet   eat these things quickly  lest the soup cools and congeals to an unappealing gelatinous glob! the filling    if you eat your dumplings like me (i e  outside in)  then usually the filling is last   i liked this little nub of pork   it was tender  not gristly and juicy   dip it in a little bit of the black vinegar and you're good to go  i've also tried a few of their cold appetizer dishes   we had the spicy beef with tripe  spicy bamboo shoots  and cold gluten   the spicy beef with tripe was facking amazeballs   tender  chewy  bouncy tripe  slicked with blazingly hot chile oil   this will burn the lips off your face and is definitely not for the faint of heart   i actually found it to be quite nuanced   if you can stand it  and wait for the heat to ebb down a little  you'll get a bit of citrusy floral aftertaste from the szechuan peppercorns and chilies  accented with the fresh green crunch of chopped cilantro stems   deadly  but balanced   my favorite part of this dish was definitely the tripe  the slices of beef shin are good but forgettable my friends and i came around 4 00pm  missing both the lunch and dinner crowds  so there was no wait at all   i imagine during peak hours  the wait will be horrendous   but if you're fiending for xlb's  you can't do much better than this joint  did i mention it's mighty easy on the wallet? that should soften the wait  d
nothing better on a cold and shitty day than to hit flushing for some out of this world crab & pork soup buns  chicken rice cake  seafood soup and some delish appetizers  the soup buns in my opinion are fresher and more succulent than our family fav joe's shanghai  the appetizers such as spicy bamboo shoots  smoked bean curd w  vegetables  scallion pancake w  sliced beef and deep fried egg and chives 'empanada like' bun are out of this world! tip  come early w  cash b c no credit cards accepted 
a must   i tried the scallion pancake with sliced beef   the only complain was i wish it was bigger since it was so good  the pan fried dumpling were great even after i got a second degree burn     i kept eating it   they were that good   hey the waiter was very nice as he saw that the burning hot liquid in the dumpling burnt my hand which  led me to scream   he immediately got me a large ice pack   the steam dumpling were ok but i'm not a fan of pork   will def come back
good dumplings  just wear black if you don't want any of the soup stuff on your clothing  they need to expand  too small and crowded  very friendly   if you're looking someplace really clean  then this place not it  they use hot tea to clean the tables 
the xiao long bao was pretty okay but i tried some of the noodle dishes and it was filled with oily  the noodles were coated with oily 
well i finally made it to four and twenty blackbirds in brooklyn   the closed sign was on the door but there were people in there so i went in   i was extremely disappointed in the choice of pies they had  however i ended up buying two pieces   i tried the chamomile buttermilk and my husband tried the salted caramel apple   i give credit where it's due  the pie was delicious   they are very over priced   a very small piece of pie was $5 75 and then they have the nerve to charge  25 cents for the smallest amount of whipped cream i have ever seen!!!  needless to say i won't be going back there again 
this is a nice quaint little joint  the service is good  and food is awesome  my girlfriend and i downed 3 orders of the soup dumpling  a bowl of soy milk  seaweed and some tendon appetizer a must is the crab meat xiao long bao if you are here it eat only one item  it is very juicy  i am salivating as i am writing this review  damn it!!!
my go to spot for soup dumplings! great prices and great food  we usually order rice cakes with shredded chicken  scallion beef pancakes  and pork chop noodle soup  only complaint is that they are cash only 
service is slow  soup dumplings are ok 
great place to sit and kill some time with whomever  but the food inside great  mostly homemade  the soup dumplings are popular  try them  i like one of the soups too   my favorite is the pork chop go in the lunch time its better that way   mostly crowded and only takes cash!
just had been there one time  the food is not that good as i thought and i do not like the service there  will probably not go again!
i love this place! i've been here so many times   what i usually have +scallion pancake with sliced beef+soup dumplings+shanghai pan fried udoni've also tried other noodle dishes from this place and loved them   the pancake with sliced beef is my favorite here   i just really love the flavor it gives out   as for the soup dumplings  i love them but i also had better   this is why i'm giving it a 4 and not a 5   hehe  but overall  i think it's a great place for food 
so  first  this place gets a 3 5 5  yelp doesn't do decimals   we followed the advice of other yelpers and ordered  cucumber & garlic cold app  one order of pork dumplings  one order of pork crab dumplings  and the scallion pancake with beef  overall  the flavors were good but not we will dream about this for the rest of lives delicious  the dumplings in sf at yank sing are still our favorite  but they're way more costly so i guess you get what you pay for  for the cost  not bad  not bad at all  overall  good food but no wow factor 
still okay i guess but not somewhere i frequent anymore  quality of the soup dumplings has gone down significantly  the skin of the soup dumpling is so freaking thick now! practically almost eating huge baos or something   not cool 
ok  so it was my fault for losing the receipt but i called them up and told them and they said "no problem  we can look up the purchase"  i bought a viper car starter at best buy for a christmas gift and made an appt  with them to install it  they said because i have no receipt they can't do it  they said they cannot find my purchase on their computer  it was purchased in dec  and the appt  to install was feb  i called the main headquarters and they also said nope  it's the store policy  so i said "how about returning it?"  they said no refund  so even though the box says "geek squad"  which is only best buy  they won't budge  therefore  i'm stuck with it  i had one installed last year by them and guess what? it doesn't work because they had an idiot that installed it  best buy  trumbull  ct  will never see me back there 
i'm gonna have to say the soupy dumplings here beats out joe's shanghai's soupy dumplings   they have excellent appetizers   which are a bit spicy and that's how i like it   overall  the service is so so  which is way better than service at joe's shanghai   the decor is nothing special   the table i was sitting at was wobbling  which annoyed the sheet outta me   the food is where this place earns it's stars that's where it really matters 
the xiao long pao is really good! the fried dough is so so  the restaurant opens early  which is good for quick yummy breakfast  i gave 4 stars since the service was too slow  i ordered only 2 dishes and it took me almost an hour to complete my meal 
went here yesterday after the mets game  this place was packed with people from every walk of life    i was very optimistic to eat here and so was my dad   we are big fans of soup dumplings and usually eat at joes shanghai  we ordered what everyone recommended    the dumplings    obvi   and the scallion pancakes  everything was really tasty and good   the waiters were a little mean and rude and didn't want to give us more tea   i explained to my dad that you have to flag down waiters sometimes and it isn't considered rude  i really liked the dumplings   but not more than joes   i like the menu better at joes but would definitely eat there again      if i had to!
a nice local dumpling restaurant  but i was a bit disappointed at lack of service  we had soup dumplings for appetizer  they tasted great  seafood noodle soup was great too  but i didn't expect the kind of noodle; it was more like instant noodle  pork chop noodle soup? maybe a good try and tasted good too  but i don't want wet pork chop  bang for the buck? yes  good to be here!p s  no creditcard! bring cash!
pork xiao long bao  ftw!!!i absolutely love xlb's  they're fun  delicious and so filling! people have been telling me this is the place for xlb's and they were right!i didn't get the one with crab since i'm not a big crab fan  i went for the usual pork  and it was delicious! the skin wasn't too thick  and it was piping hot  just the way i like it!my xlb's took relatively long compared to joe's shanghai or shanghai cafe  i must admit  it looked like they were making them to order  then again  it shouldn't have taken so long my friend got scallion pancakes   they were alright  nothing special  but the xlb's were definitely awesome!tip  order the cold soy milk! it's delicious!
can't really comment on all their other foods  i only tried the pork buns and shanghai noodles  their pork buns  delicious! you see the ladies working feverishly to make the little buns filled with pork goodness on the side  it does seem like it takes a while to come out but if it's freshly made i'm not going to complain! i went around 6pm on saturday and it wasn't that packed  but by the time i got out  there was definitely a wait! i love a good pork bun with lots of juice inside and good chewy texture on the bun  this place hit those marks  and not that bad on the price too! would come back    only if it was closer  cash only 
2 words my dulas  soup dumplings  i salivate thinking about the crab meat pause 
okay  first off  anyone who says joe's shanghai is a better dumpling house needs to get their taste buds burned off just kidding but really  number one most favorite dumpling house ever  ever  ever  i can't stress how much i love this place this is always my go to place for good food for a good price  there's absolutely no way anyone can walk into this restaurant and not order at least one pan of soup dumplings  that should be illegal i mean  i've gone to this place before as a party of two or three  and our bill has never exceeded $30  i always order two pans of soup dumplings  and the scallion pancake  which is absolutely amazing  i usually order noodles for an entree  often u don or panfried  both extremely good  and well worth it  personally  i feel that their entrees are served family style  so it's something you can share around the table  probably too much for one person  but that's just me  and if you go for breakfast  you should definitely try the chinese crullers (youtiao) dipped in hot soy milk  it was all i ever ate on sunday mornings  as a child the decor is very home y and cozy  the space is a bit tight  sometimes if they're really busy  they might end up seating you at the same table as another party  but it usually isn't a big deal  and remember to always try to catch them before rush hour! the line can get pretty long  but the wait usually isn't more than 30 minutes  the service is alright  but nothing to complain about  sometimes they might slack when it's busy  but it's understandable i come to this restaurant almost every time i'm in flushing  and it never fails to satisfy me  this is a restaurant that will guarantee a smile on your face by the time you walk out  my last trip here  the three of us left the restaurant smiling ear to ear  and never happier about completing our meal  and not one person  that i've introduced to this restaurant  has ever disliked their experience definitely a place i'd recommend for casual dining 
geeeeez  everything seems so much juicier and the xiao long bao skin just seems so much tighter  pork and crab xie here are delicious so don't hesitate  also i enjoyed the side dishes (re  everything but the soup dumplings) more than joe's  perhaps just my opinion but it was a great  great meal 
simply the best soup dumping ever made   pork chop soup was also very tasty this place is very clean and well organized   the owners clearly know how to run a restaurant   if you visit and there is a line out the door don't you dare leave   go inside take a number it's worth the wait 
the xiao long bao (soup dumpling) was subpar in my opinion  the skins were thick and the flavor just didn't do it for me  i prefer joes shanghai in chinatown  i found the pan fried udon noodles to be undercooked  salty and flavorless  the best part of the meal was the hot tea and the pancakes with sliced beef  i believe it was a black bean sauce in between the layers of the pancake and i was quite surprised how good that was 
the crab xiao lung baos are not great here  very bland and lacks crabby flavor like the shanghai garden restaurant or shanghai cafe in chinatown  what they do very well though is the spicy beef tendons and the dishes you see off to the side when y ou come into the restaurant  its a pretty large space and you'd be surprised at the empty tables so we didn't have to wait long on friday evening  make sure to get the sweet soy milk to relieve you from some of that spice!
i thought seattle's dim sum could not be beat  i was totally wrong  this is the place to get a lot of food and share with friends and family  i really enjoyed the vegetable dumplings with the horseradish  i will be visiting the next time i'm in new york!
i've been here multiple times and haven't been disappointed my staples include the amazing soup dumplings (crab pork or pork) and love ther scallion pancake with beef! the dumplings aren't as "fatty" as joe shanghai's but i personally like them better   also the crab dumpling isn't too fishy tasting like some other ones  noodles are pretty good here too!
i tried this place last week for the first time  because of the reviews  the service was ok  not the best  but the soup dumplings are amazing  big and juicy is how i'd describe them the scallion pancakes were fluffy and crispy  i will be visiting again and again 
this is one of my favorite chinese restaurants in flushing  they have high quality food at affordable prices  the place is big so most of the time you can get a table  and they have some of the best pork steamed buns anywhere ( i recommend pork steamed buns )  definitely try this place out  only bad thing is you may have to wait a little long for the food 
george was wonderful to work with   he took his time to find me just the right apartment   he went above and beyond working with management  etc   i highly recommend george if you ever need a real estate agent
the soup dumplings here are superb  maybe the best in flushing   however there did not appear to be many other items on the menu that looked appetizing   joe shanghai has good soup dumplings and a much more varied menu 
this place has the best soup dumplings (xian long bao) ever! i ordered both crab and pork and  they are so ridiculously good!the "soup" seasoning is just perfection  the dumpling is delicate and just right  the pork (my favorite) is well cooked and it all just comes together so nicely umm umm good!also  the pork ears  bamboo shoots and crispy nooddles with chicken are alsopre tty good!if you're in the mood for a flushing outing ~ this is a must go!yep  you bet i'd recommend!
the food here is very consistent and top notch  the only drawback is the wait and the parking in the area  there's always a line  regardless of the time  it is usually a 15 20 minute wait  but on the weekends  it can take a while  the food is excellent and worth the trip if you're in the mood for soup dumplings or authentic shanghainese cuisines 
service is slow like everybody states  the easiest way to get a waiters attention is to stare hardcore at one of them till they feel you looking  then wave   once you do that they will run right over to you food is really good   we has the steamed dim sum which was filled with yummy soup and meat   we also had the scallion pancake with beef which was sooooooo so good   after i had my first bite i automatically had to order another one  and its a pretty good size appetizer for a party of 2   finally we had the fish with salty cabbage soup which came out not too hot but was also really good next time in flushing i will come back here if anything just for the scallion pancake with beef  yes  it was that good reminder  they only take cash
just like their name states  they make delicious soup dumpling fresh and on the spot  this is my preferred place to go for soup dumpling in nyc (both their pork and seafood dumpling are homeruns)  on the weekends the lines could be long as they don't take reservations  everything else on the menu is on par with the rest of flushing  service could be better and the old guy with glasses always looks mad  cheer up old man your making money!!!
food coma and a half! this place is non stop busy even at 4pm on a sunday  i ordered the beef scallion pancake which was pretty good  i didn't expect it to be fried and preferred it if it wasn't  the sauce in it was a bit on the salty side  i also tried the crab and pork soup dumplings which were really good  the steamed vegetable dumplings were also really good 
we only had the xlb as we were just passing through for a snack  but they were certainly better than anything we've tried in manhattan  glad to see other reviewers mentioning din tai fung   certainly a good baseline for comparison (don't get me started on joe's)  are they as good? no  but if din tai fung is a 9 10 then these would only be a point behind my only gripe is that these can take a good while to come out  but you kind of have to accept that at any good xlb house 
yummy soup dumplings! best so far compared to those in chinatown ny or boston   they have 2 flavors   crab and pork  both are tasty  gobble them up as soon as they arrive 
i loved it here!!!! authentic tasty shanghai food! if you are looking for some tasty shanghai food in flushing you should try this one out! i always come here whenever i crave for shanghai food  the soup dumplings here might take while to wait for but is all worthy  their cold plates are also very tasty  me and my family love the crispy cucumbers and spicy bamboo shred  also their scallion pancake is not bad either not the best one but not bad  compared to other shanghai cuisine restaurants in main street this is by far the best one!!! i would recommend it for anyone out there p s some food might be spicy so you should tell them to lower down the spiciness if you don't eat spicy food 
the best soup dumplings!!! i used to go to joe's shanghai near the municipal parking lot  but  when i found this place  i never went back to joe's  i've been going to this place for 3 years  i always order the pork & crab soup dumplings  pork cabbage noodle soup  and sticky rice with seafood  the soup dumplings are very delicate  you have to be very steady to lift the dumplings onto your spoon because you don't want to spill the precious soup inside the dumplings so be careful!also  they have cold dishes on the menu  my friends always order the spicy jelly fish and bamboo  they are both spicy and delicious although they burn my tongue a little  warning  this place is always crowded  my friends and i waited for 30 min or longer to get a table  i recommend you to get here around 5pm or 6pm for a dinner  if you come here around 7pm or later  dan dan dan    you might wait longer and starve yourself for a long time from watching people eating the soup dumplings 
best shanghai dumplings so far  they assume you want a basket and they assume right  the skin is thin but just thick enough to hold the meaty goodness and the juices that could cause a third degree burn  delicious burn
that annoying female host on travel channel's "food wars" should do a pork soup dumpling challenge between nan shian dumpling house and joe's shanghai in a blind taste test  i bet i would choose nan shian 10 out of 10 times over joe's shanghai  oh wait  nevermind  that show don't do asian food  only american heart attack food buffalo wing war chicago italian beef war   kansas fried chicken war    lockhart  texas bbq war    minneapolis juicy lucy war
the best veggie dumplings in flushing this place is cheap and gets very busy   i recommend calling in and picking your food up other recommendations  vegetable noodle soup  bean curd and mixed vegetable  and steamed pork dumplings (for meat eaters) 
my favorites are the crab dumplings and their cold appetizers!
this place is small but their food is delicious  they are famous for their steam pork buns (　　　小　龍　包)  one order comes with 6 tiny buns  watch out because they have juice inside the bun that are boiling hot 
i have to agree that these are the best soup dumplings ever! the place does get super crowded after 11am on the weekend  so get there early or prepare to wait a very long time food  5 5as stated before  best soup dumplings (xia long bao) ever! i also recommend the udon noodles and rice cakes  their soy milk and sweet tofu dessert was also very good  service  3 5service was pretty quick  though it isn't super friendly  i did feel like i was being rushed to leave because the place was packed  atmosphere  1 5the place is loud  like most asian places  and because it is packed  it is more of a eat and get out of there place 
i love this place! been going here since i moved to nyc  don't be scared away by the sanitation rating  the food is great and i've never had any issues  soup dumplings here are the best in flushing 
whenever i visit flushing  i would always go to nan xiang with my family   even though they expanded the store  there is still sometimes a wait during lunch  dinner time   the line is quick and it is well worth it though!  the xiao long bao (soup dumplings) there are amazing!  the broth is flavorful and not too oily and the wrapper is thin and good chewy   they also make very delicious veggie dumplings that kind of look like cute green mice   they're opaque and filled with green veggies and vermicelli   so delish!  i love the cold appetizers  especially the gluten pieces with bamboo shoots and mushrooms (i don't know what it is called in english so it might not sound appetizing but please trust me  it is really good) and the spicy beef and tripe   they have traditional shanghai breakfast like scallion pancakes  shaobing (sesame flatbread)  youtiao (chinese crullers)  soy milk  etc  in the mornings (some of it is on the all day menu as well)  perfect for an awesome brunch 
great tasting dumplings  especially the crab and pork dumplings  these dumplings have some broth in them which makes it different than most other dumplings  the shanghai udon noodles very were good too and has bits of steak in it  also had scallion pancakes which are hard to mess up  overall food was good and so was the service 
amazing dumplings  hold crap  and i don't have to go all the way to chinatown in the city 
shen jiang bao and xiao long bao  great xia long bao  fresh and tasty  the shen jiang bao were disappointing   they were cold  still tasty but not what they could've been  we were there saturday at 8 or 9 pm  so this was prime time and the food was flying  good service  etc   etc 
i had the yummy yummy soup dumplings here and the scallion pancake as well   we tried the pork dumplings and the pork & crab dumplings (just a note    they're called "buns" on the menu) and both were sooo good!  the meat was well seasoned  not overcooked  and the soup was flavorful and steamy   some of our dumplings tore when we pulled them out of the bamboo box because they weren't sitting on the cabbage and the skin got stuck to the bamboo  but that was the only downside to this place!the scallion pancake had beef inside and some sort of oyster or hoisin sauce  and it was all sorts of tasty greasy goodness this is apparently the place to go for soup dumplings (buns) in flushing  so check it out if you're a fan!
i think this place's soup dumplings are **almost** as good as din tai fung's (whose are really the ultimate perfection)  but still 5 star worthy and one of the best on the east coast of the us  the bountiful soup that comes pouring out of the little packets of deliciousness is flavorful and the meat inside is very tender  if i'm going to be picky  i would just say din tai fung's soup dumplings are a little smaller (the smaller the better  because more difficult to make) and the meat could be chopped just a little bit finer  but again  i'm just making very picky comparisons  put in your soup dumpling orders as soon as you sit down  because they make and steam them on the spot  so they will take longer to come out than your other dishes  then  get settled in and choose your accompanying dishes from the small menu  and you're off to a special and memorable meal!
waited quite a while for a seat  the place was packed until i went to the bathroom i noticed there were at least 5 tables empty yet tons of people waiting outside  thought that was strange  tried the crab soup dumplings  they were alright  but i still think joes shanghai is better  but the beef wrapped in scallion pancake was bomb! best i ever had  very oily however  the shredded beef and chili over noodle was delicious but very very very much drenched in oil 
nan xiang or joe's shanghai  nan xiang or joe's nan xiang    yeah nan xiang wins! they both tied for the soup dumplings  joe's the soup is fattier  nan xiang thinner broth  softer wrapper scallion pancakes  joe's are good but all grease  nan xiang wrapped around thin sliced beef with hoisen sauce  no grease  winner!noodle dishes joe's greasy  nan xiang fresh noodles  no grease winner! also nan xiangs kitchen is open  clean actually the spotless  the cooks are women and they make the dumplings right in front of you  now if only nan xiang served sliced oranges when they gave you the bill  joe's wins on that one     
i always come here ready to feast   usually with a group of 4 or 6  we order stacks upon stacks of xiao long bao (soup dumplings)   the dumplings are full of juicy deliciousness!  it's also funny when everyone gasps and shares in the sadness of watching you accidentally poke a hole in a dumpling & all the soup gushes out   it's quite the art to successfully pick one up from the steamed bamboo trays!pairing the xiao long baos with their cold apps is a good idea   i love their spicy beef & tripe and jellyfish   only thing is that so does everyone else which means they often run out if you're too late   it's the saddest thing when the server looks over to where they display them & shakes his head no   ahh why must you run out??  also get their scallion pancakes with sliced beef it's often crowded but they turn over tables quickly so most def wait!!  also i recently came during a down time & watched them rigorously scrub down the floors so two thumbs for caring about cleanliness 
let me preclude this by the fact that i lived in beijing and hong kong for four years  so i know what a proper xiao long bao tastes like  it's virtually a work of art  i wasn't super wowed by these xiao long bao  but they were satisfactory and hit the spot  i'm also getting the feeling that this may be as good as it gets in ny the only thing i got was the xiao long bao since i was eating by myself  it's about $6 for 6  which is fairness  is pretty reasonable  they're also a lot bigger than your typical xlb  but maybe that's an american thing (portion sizes) that is  while some people probably love this  it actually contributes to some of the xlb's major flaws  other than that  the flavor of the broth and pork were totally spot on  i was a bit disappointed to see that the wrapper was a bit grainy instead of the smooth textured xlb that i'm guessing you can even find in los angeles (din tai fung)  these monsters are definitely sturdy little ones  and in that way  its fairly easy to pick up the dumpling without the skin breaking soup spilling before you dip it into the ginger & vinegar  the wrapper can be a bit thick and chewy (in some spots) to accommodate for how much soup is in each xlb  though i've definitely had worse think of great xlbs like extremely delicate and strong ballerinas  some people complain that the skin will break more easily as a result  but the truth is an especially skilled chef can achieve both  these are definitely aren't dainty like the highly refined xlbs i've had in years past  but given the price point and various other options  they're definitely not too shabby  best xlb ever? nah  did it hit the spot? definitely 
this place is the joint! prices are great and the soups  dumplings  and entrees are satisfying and tasty  i've been a regular for years  parking is the pits  and it's always crowded and cramped  but the food is consistently terrific i've had nearly everything on the menu  even the spicy beef & tripe  and have never been disappointed authentic asian at it's best heron is my favorite server 
the food here is amazing  i've been coming here for many years now  the xiao long bao here are to die for  it's freshly made in front of the shop  there was about 4 to 6 chefs in a tiny space with clear windows wrapping the individual dumplings  i would be giving this place a 5 star  however the wait was incredibly long  i came with 4 others and we had to wait nearly an hour till there was a table for us  nonetheless the food came out fairly quick  the waiter was very splendid  he memorized our order without using his pad   i am impressed 
thanks johnny j  for inviting me here! the soup dumplings were mad good yo 
1pm chinese breakfast of very affordable deliciousness  we even bought a few dishes to take home to a friend  he didn't get any soup dumplings 
i would give 3 5 stars if i could! i ordered the spicy beef with tripe as it was recommended by another yelper  unfortunately for me  it had a weird after taste  which i experienced another time at an asian restaurant  it's some asian spice i'm guessing that makes everything else taste weird   even my water! left an after taste for 15 minutes and kind of ruined my entire meal! i also had the scallion pancakes   they were delicious  and the pork crab soup dumplings   they were good but not anything i would order again! my girlfriend loved all of her dishes including tofu and udon noodles with vegetables    she couldn't stop raving and ate everything!
decent food but coming from la  i could only give it 3 stars  and i had to deduct a star because the crab xiao long bao was a rip off  don't get me wrong  it is tasty but there was no crab meat whatsoever  the waitress said the little meat they add to the top of the dumplings is just a marker  not one of the 6 dumplings we got had a marker  uploaded pic  buyer beware 
amazing food served at communal tables  the atmosphere was a bit loud during sunday brunch hours and it definitely helps if you speak mandarin to make sure you get what you want inside the dumplings 
i'm hoping i can bring an outsider's perspective   i'm from seattle and a total fan of xlb   let me start by saying that if i'm giving this place 4 stars then dinesty in richmond bc gets a 6 or a 7 (no i don't work there)    but nan xiang is really good   i've discovered that there seem to be two "styles" to xlb   the delicate kind that din tai fung does (along with dinesty) and the more robust  thicker skin style that nan xiang represents   if i had to choose i'd go with delicate but about once out of every 4 times i think i'd want what nx delivers   it is so big and soupy!  in what they are  they are just right and    what is it with you people who think joe's is "it?"  i happily take the mta 7 pilgrimage   seriously good place 
my favorite place in queens  amazing shanghai dumplings 
i really enjoyed my dining experience here  we were whisked away to the only table empty   and how lucky we were  since a line of ~10 people formed after us   and quickly given tea  we ordered the garlic cucumbers  spicy bamboo shoots  vegetable dumplings  and  of course  the soup dumplings  to be honest  i have nothing to compare them too  but the pork flavoring was great  and the soup dumpling eating experience was fun  the skins of the dumplings were so tender  the vegetable dumplings  while not soup dumplings  were also very good and filling  the aforementioned side dishes were abundant and flavorful even if simple you'll feel a bit cramped but not totally invading your neighbors  tip  flip up the top of our tea pot when you want more tea  great flushing experience!
"dispute not with her  she is lunatic " william shakespeare  richard iiisome psychiatrists believe racism is a sign of mental illness  i agree  disguise it anyway you want to  say it's being old fashioned but  it is insane!i promised to upload pictures if we went back  here they are!my husband's mother who was chef at her own restaurants through out the 5 boros for many years went  she was appalled that her son would force her to go to a restaurant that didn't have the "right" kind of chinese people  she made my husband's brother order since she felt the staff was below her she is from china  then moved to hong kong then manhattan's china town then brooklyn and now flushing  but somehow she has not managed to understand that there are other people in nyc besides the "right' kind of chinese i don't know if  other born in china chinese people are this closed minded but she is extreme  his dad seems normal  my husband turned out normal too in spite of being raised by someone so sheltered and well   insane  we have a mandarin friend who she refused to let in her house to use the bathroom when we went by there because he is not cantonese  he doesn't make me deal with her  if i don't want to and as you can imagine me being not just a white devil but having  blond hair and blue eyes  i am not her favorite person  but in spite of  her display of insanity at the restaurant over the fact that the staff was not the "right" kind of chinese and there for probably dirty in her opinion she really did like the soup dumplings but not the rest of the food  soup dumplings are not cantonese so they can't really do it worse then her since it isn't  a part of her  usual cuisine  their entrees are just regular sloppily done not cut properly or wok seared as well as they should be just go for the soup dumplings the soup dumplings are good  and to the staff i apologize for her "keep mixing the races until we're all the same grayish color   then there'll be no more racism  once we're all the same shade  man  'hey  gray!' 'who you callin' gray  gray?' and then we'll actually be able to hate someone for the person that they are " tom rhodes
place gets very crowded  but the wait didn't seem too bad  i've had better but this place is good enough  pancake with beef  my favorite turnup cake soup dumplings  meh fred pork buns  not a fan nothing but dough
came around 5 pm on a monday and we were seated instantly   despite diners being outnumbered by waitresses and cooks  the service was slow   the soup dumplings were nice   what's not to like about soup dumplings?  i think i like the dumplings at joe's shanghai a bit better though would i wait in a line down the block for these?  probably not   but i certainly enjoyed them 
this place has very yummy dumplings  and that's why we trek all the way here from the southern tip of brooklyn   but on top of their dumplings  all the rest of the food we've tried here is not bad either   the service is decent  nothing to complain about  and it's relatively fast   the location is also comfortable  in new york  we are used to going to places with good food  but cramped space   this is not like that at all  i actually feel very comfy sitting here to eat   there's also a parking lot across the street   depending on when we go  there's sometimes parking   if you are in flushing  on a craving for good dumplings   this is definitely a place to try!
favorite xiao long bao joint  however it's gets very crowded  the xiao long bao's skin is a decent thickness  so that the soup isn't visible  the soup & meat is delish   i can do it with or without the sauce their turnip puffs are delicious  best i've ever had  the puffs are crisp and the turnip is shredded  typically can finish in one bite  but i try to savor it as long as i can  as it only comes 4 in a dish  i'd also recommend the sour cabbage & fish noodle soup  very tasty! downside for the noodles and rice cake dish is that it's super greasy but it never stopped me from coming back   3
they are basically famous for their xiao loong pau  this are hand made on the spot and you can still see the "sifu" making them as you ordered   always busy so be prepare for not so attentive service to the extend of being rushed and rude   and also sometimes the quality of the pau suffers too    i once ordered their beef rolled with scallion pancake but comes in just a few miserable pieces of beef and some kind of sauce and nothing else  the one in flushing mall served up a much better one with generous amount of beef  parsley and also crushed peanuts     at least something to chew on      their udon portion are on the small size so don't expect to share   all in all   i think there are better places out there with delicious xiao loong pau and a service with a smile 
it was meant to be  my friends and i didn't initially start out thinking we we're going to hit up this spot that day  but due to some schedule conflict  we took our train straight to flushing and ate to our hearts desire at nan xiang dumpling house the wait wasn't that long for a table of 5 on a saturday afternoon  service was quick! we ordered a bunch of things and some of which are listed below   scallion pancake w  beef   shiz was bananasssssssss! savory and delicious  it was a scallion pancake like no other being that it had a bit a fluff  aka   order it   wonton thingy in a peanut spicy sauce   the skin was a bit under cooked but the sauce was flavorful  my friends and i kept dipping other food into it  )  beef and tripe (spicy)  huge fan! it was nicely marinated in spicy sauce that made us want to pick it on it all day  flavorful and nicely cooked   sliced pig ears   really great! crunchy  )  rice cake stir fry was bombed! not too oily  enough flavor to keep you wanting more   steamed pork dumpling   soup   what a procedure to eat this! but once you handle it like a champ and you take that first bite   the flavor just bursts into your mouth  get ready to slurp the slurp!  pan fried dumplings   it was good  but not that fantastic compared to the other dishes  i prefer the steamed!  fresh soybean drink!   yesanyways   go here  cuz it's great   )
we went on a saturday so i thought it would be busy  it was  even the snowy bad weather didn't slow anyone down  lucky for us (party of 2) we got a seat the moment we walked in   we ordered (1) scallion pancake  it was good but it seemed it was deep fried not pan fried  a little too greasy for me but still good   (1) pork and cabbage noodle soup  this was a much bigger amount of noodles then i thought it would be  not too much pork but the noodles were good   (1) cucumber and garlic appetizer  seems like they gave us just about a whole cucumber sliced and cut into pieces not too heavy on the garlic   (1) pork and crab meat dumplings  this was easily the best dish we ordered that day  it was soup dumplings but they don't mention that  great surprise  very very tasty i would recommend this and probably the main reason i'd go back bathroom was unisex and almost always a line but no big deal  prices are reasonable  everything i mentioned here was under $22 with tax * also noted  they accept cash only! *
"why do we rely on  the food advice of a tire  also known as the michelin man?" that was the question posed to me as the trademark of the plump tire man depicted on michelin stickers outside nan xiang dumpling house became visible   before i had a chance to reply  we were already inside nan xiang   for a few minutes  we stood before the dumpling station  transfixed by the sight of one of  the cooks making xiao long bao   rolling out the dough  scooping the filling and pinching the dumpling close  although it was a mild winter day  the decided chill in the air and  the thought of slurping the soup out of the xiao long biao made us giddy with anticipation  as we sat down  we asked for the crab and pork xiao long bao and the scallion and beef pancakes   again  the michelin man became our topic of conversation especially since it was hardly four (4) hours since our last meal and we ourselves are probably turning into the michelin man   over a hundred years since the first publication of the michelin guide in 1900 to help drivers maintain their cars  find decent lodging  and eat well while touring france  bibendum (michelin man's name  taken from the latin phrase nunc est bibendum or now is the time to drink) graced the shores of new york in 2006   the integrity of its ratings stem from the fact that bib does not say when he is visiting  he pays for his dinner and does not accept gifts  and bib did not let us down   when the crab and pork xiao long bao was finally served  it didn't take long for us to slurp and savor the crab roe   it was not salty and the broth was sufficient in amount   we then turned our attention to the scallion and beef pancake   the pancake was thick and it was like a thick taco with thin slices of beef smeared with hoisin sauce   it was a bit salty and oily for me   nonetheless  we left satiated and glad that neither bib nor yelp let us down with its rating of the xiao long baos here 
holy guacamole is this place good! and this is coming from someone who's not even a fan of soup dumplings  which of course this place makes excellent  i'm a true fan for stuff that's not the dumplings  those greens with soybean side dish  and that beef pancake? top notch stuff  i came here expecting sub par other stuff with excellent dumplings  what i got was excellent dumplings with phenomenal other stuff 
word of advice  don't come here during lunchtime  there will be a long wait  i love this place  only negative thing i can say about them isthat there is always a long wait  you must order their steamed pork buns!we also order some cold appetizers and a stir fry udon noodle or crispy noodle with chicken is great too  prices are cheap  reasonable too 
my friend and i were so excited to try these famous soup dumplings that we raced here via subway from grand central  and two other friends trekked all the way from harlem and new jersey  which in retrospect is pretty damn dedicated for a tuesday night  thankfully  nan xiang lived up to the hype of being travel worthy! we followed yelp advice and ordered an array of soup dumplings (pork & crab  and pork alone)  along with some scallion pancakes (both beef and plain)  some pan fried dumplings  and the beef & rice cake dish  the food was absurdly cheap and superbly flavorful and delicious  the only complaint i have is that the pork & crab dumplings didn't taste at all different from the pork; i'm not sure if that's because they actually served us pork dumplings by accident or because the crab is just that flavorless  the soup dumplings were otherwise extremely flavorful and fun to eat to boot  with most of us having a pretty high broth in mouth success rate thanks to tips from other reviews  i'd say that the most important part of picking up the dumplings is to make sure not to poke or prod them too much with the tongs (surprise  surprise); it seems to help to use the spoon to pick them up  i highly recommend getting the fried scallion pancake  because there's nothing like broth and fried food to make you feel nice and satiated on a cold night  the pan fried dumplings were pretty standard  and the rice cake and beef was super tasty despite being a grease travaganza  that being said  nan xiang's dining area is extremely warm  so be prepared to strip like i did all in all  a fabulous dining experience at nan xiang  and if you're in the area you should probably get some bubble tea for dessert from any of the plethora of boba stands in the area 
i used to love this place  but ever since they expanded the food hasn't been what i remembered  and i think the staff has gotten worse (they were okay before compared to other local chinese restaurants)  and despite the extra space  it still feels ridiculously crowded  the crowding was almost cozy before expansion  especially in the winter (you need the extra body heat then)   it's a shame  because i have fond memories of eating here with my friends  i'm hesitant to recommend this place  but price wise i suppose it's worth trying 
i'm a newbie when it comes to the asian food mecca that is flushing  but the first thing you realize after a short stroll is that you could have a decent lunch for a little more than $5 almost anywhere  and out of all the offerings  nan xiang is a definitely a standout  you won't find the gummy and sticky skins in these dumplings  their iterations are absolutely perfect  never have i had a soup dumpling this delicate that actually held its form  if you've had a xiao long bao before  you'd know the hassle of picking it up without having split and tear on you  and when it's not doing that  it's too thick skinned and gummy  none of those problems appear here  aside from the dumplings  their scallion pancakes are great too  it was fried to a perfect golden brown  without it being drenched in oil  not only that  they've actually seasoned it  unlike the past three iterations i've had of it 
came here on a saturday night and there was no wait! as opposed to joe's shanghai where theres always a wait and you feel rushed  the soup dumplings were amazing! in my opinion the best ones i had in ny so far  love this place and wish i had a plate of their soup dumplings in front of me right now hahaa 
i recently attended claire's soup dumpling uye  despite growing up with chinese food every sunday (as the torah commands)  i am still getting exposed to new asian foods  and had never had xiao long bao  this meal was incredible from start to finish  my experiences were as follows   sitting next to amy s 3 bp blogspot com _yscit… was a real treat because she helped us order and explained how to eat everything  we started with a cucumber salad ferenc biz pictures boys… that had great sesame oil dressing  and a pressed tofu slaw images icanhascheezburge… that i loved we had some other delicious side dishes too (like a bowl of soy milk farm3 static flickr com … )  but the important thing is the soup dumplings  when they came out  they were steaming healthandphysicaleducati… and could barely be touched  amy jokingly told me to hold them like a breast medindia net afp images …   which made it hard to maintain control 3 bp blogspot com  6z9l5… of the tongs  but  i set out on my journey to food happiness blog tmcnet com blog ric… i've never had anything like xlb   it was like getting two meals in one earthlinggb files wordpr… first you get the soup  then the delicious pork or crab images cheezburger com c…as good as this meal was  it was especially nice to be able to eat with amy and elle  two people familiar with the cuisine filehurricane com viewer…i juddhandler com wp conte… would definitely come back here dlewis net nik archives … 
that's right  one star we went in and were immediately seated right next to the door  wonderful  since it was 20 something degrees outside  i figured it was because the restaurant was cramped and there were no other seats  so i dealt with it you'd think that a place known for their xiao long bao would mass produce those babies  especially on a friday night  but when we asked them  they said that we'd have to wait 20 minutes for an order  20 minutes! completely ludicrous  i'd rather just go to shanghai cafe and get some xiao long bao that are most likely better and come out 10 15 minutes sooner anyway  i went in search of the bathroom because i'd had almost nothing but water and juice the whole day  and when i was heading there  lo and behold  there was another room with plenty of empty tables  wow  how considerate of them on a side note  the bathroom was beyond cold  i don't like freezing over when i pee we all basically went "screw it" and got the hell outta there  sentosa received three more customers that night 
first  let's get the obvious xiao long bao comparison with joe's shanghai out of the way i believe the title of "best xlb" is way too subjective but this definitely belongs with the best in ny conversation   compared to joe's  nan xiang's xlb have a subtler  less fatty broth while the dumpling skin is softer and ever so slightly thicker   on xlb alone  which place i'd visit on any given day would depend on which side of the heart attack taste scale i want to be on   (see barney stinson's crazy hot scale for reference)but where nan xiang wins hands down are the other dishes   for direct comparisons  the shanghai stir fry noodles  crispy noodles  and noodle soups at nan xiang are all far less greasy  more tasty than their counterparts at joe's   plus  the cold appetizers (especially the spicy jellyfish) are fantastic in execution  balancing textures and flavors masterfully   they even have soy milk of the sweet and savory varieties!  (iced soy milk is very effective in dousing the heat from spicy dishes)definitely a place to revisit in flushing!
i've been here countless times and have never been disappointed  i order the same dishes every time and the food is consistently good my staples here  pork soup dumplings (of course)  pork wrapped in scallion pancake  shanghai pan fried udon with pork  rice cakes with pork  and sometimes the cold sweetened soybean milk  i've also had the shredded pork and snow vegetable noodle soup and that was very good  pork all day  every day they've slowly expanded their empire from one of those narrow restaurants on the row of restaurants on that block of prince street to three  they're trying to keep up with demand  but it seems their kitchen is still the same size  this means that the wait for your food to come out has become longer i always tell people not to expect good service at chinese restaurants in flushing  but just a heads up    the male waiters are nicer than the female waiters  who either act like they didn't hear you when you asked for water or make you feel like you're asking the world of them  regardless  i will continue introducing co workers and bringing friends from out of town here to taste some of the best food there is in flushing 
believe me when i say that this is the best shanghainese restaurant in new york city  do you believe me? ok now go try it for yourself
i came here on a mission to try their pork soup dumplings   easily the best xlb i've ever had!! the skin was chewy and thin  yet it still encapsulated so much soup  the xlb are pretty big here  so one order was definitely enough to fill me up  be prepared to wait ~30 minutes  though   even though i was seated promptly at 4 30pm on a weekend  my dumplings didn't come for another 40 minutes  totally worth the wait though!
i don't think i've found a xlb (xiao long bao  aka  soup dumplings) that rivals those of shanghai   i may have found a contender i like a few in manhattan (shanghai cafe   shanghai he ping  to name a few) but none come close to the ones i had in nan xiang the skin of the dumpling is delicate and soft  so you have to be extra careful when picking them up  handle the dumplings with utmost care  like it's your newborn; it's cute to look at but bruises easily  yes  i just compared xlb to a newborn baby  sue me  or rather  please don't  i don't have money  i am the 99% though  the delicate skin does provide for a fun game night   forget board games   our table was poking the dumplings as if it was jenga   people were keeping score on who successfully carried out the task and got a perfect xlb with no punctures   others like me  occasionally had those faces and grunts of frustrations (with hands smacking my face) when i poked the xlb and soup starting running out  (think of the expression of losing a game of jenga) once successful  you are treated to a rich yet light and hearty soup broth   it warms your soul   see? winning has its rewards   eat it first without the vinegar to appreciate the burst of flavor   combination of delicate dumpling skin and flavorful broth is the success to a winning xlb another deal? their $1 made in house soy milk   order it hot and you are treated to a nice generous bowl (it's probably like 3 cups of soy milk!)   it has a hint of sweetness but you can taste the fresh soy milk  as if the soybeans were just grounded   the shanghai udon noodles is another good dish  it's plain (noodles and veggies  no meat) but less is more   while just a tad greasy  the noodles are cooked "al dente" and have a springiness to them   did i just use an italian term to describe a chinese dish? consider me multicultural!the  scallion pancakes were passable; it's basically fried dough   fried anything is good  right?  i was expecting more scallions however overall  i need to make more stops to flushings to get my daily dose of these perfect little dumplings   as a wise man (lil' wayne) once said  "i love you like a fat kid loves food "
i love this place  great service  the food doesn't take forever to be served and it's affordable 
we go to the one on broadway and 102nd street  it just opened in december 2014  this place is amazing because it's no bullshit  everything is under $8  they literally tell you that they do not deliver  nor do they guarantee the quality of their noodles ten minutes after it leaves the kitchen  it's special like that  so  dine in and be amazed at the quality 
i have only been here 3 times and the dumplings are awesome  they even give you healthy tea  you just have to watch what time you come here during the week lunch hour the line can get out the door but dinnertime i have always found a seat 
came by on a friday afternoon around 1pm  parked in the underground parking garage in the shopping plaza next door for $3 50 hr  got seated in about 10 minutes  we ordered the shanghai udon  chives egg pan fried cakes  and two orders for the steamed cage buns (xiao long bao)  noodles and pan fried chives cake came fairly quickly  no steam buns though  other tables mumbled about the long wait for their order of buns too and overheard a worker said that the steamer is broken and will take over an hour to fill the outstanding orders  most people cancelled their orders  was someone going to let me know the buns got delayed or what? i don't exactly have all day to wait  i asked for the check and requested the rest of the order cancelled  parked car is on the clock and i am not waiting over an hour for the buns  got the check for a total of $12 and i put on the tray a $20  after 15 minutes i still haven't gotten my change  finally flagged down someone on my change and i left without leaving a tip  waitress stopped my wife and asked no tip  are they really that clueless?
best soup dumpling place  i love their scallion pancakes and ka fu as well  i don't think i ordered anything else from there but why bother  thats certainly more than enough 
one of my favorite xiao long bao (soup dumplings) places in flushing  i go to this place more often than any other xlb places  besides  crab and meat xlb  i also had their fried dumplings  beef pancake  chicken soup  appetizers  and soy milk  they are all pretty good  the only small complain is   i wonder why the crab is so little in crab xiao long bao  it's mixed with meat so i don't taste the crab so much  also  the seating isn't very comfortable although they expanded the restaurant space  it is usually very crowded 
this place is amazing  there are very few food spots i go back to multiple times and this is one of them  their menu is simple  delicious and cheap  i don't think you can go wrong with anything on it  but of course the soup dumplings are phenomenal 
very good dim sum and shanghai style dishes  all very fresh with bright flavors  service quick and courteous  clientele is mostly locals (i e  chinese)  always a good sign  traditional soup dumplings were among the best we've had  and the beef noodle soup rang with star anise flavor  recommended among the zillion choices in the immediate area 
to sum it up  good food  shitty service   my gf and i ordered dumplings  pork buns  rice cakes with pork  and crispy noodles with seafood   we expected the buns and dumplings first but didn't receive them until the end of the meal when we were just about full   the rice cakes were great but barely any pork was served with them   the crispy noodles were delicious with lots of seafood   the dumplings and buns were tasty as well   flushing's chinatown is definitely an interesting and quirky little area  but the driving and parking is terrible!
my taste buds take it as a personal insult when people say joe's shanghai's soup dumplings are better than nan xiang's  that's outrageous!seriously  everything on the menu is amazing  it's places like these where i wish i had a second stomach that i could use to swap out my full stomach so i can continue to eat the cold dishes are great  cucumbers  jellyfish  sliced pig ears  delish!mm likes the crispy noodles with seafood  i prefer the rice cakes with beef i like their soy milk (sweet or salty) with fried crullers and scallion pancakes with beef and their soup dumplings  oh their soup dumplings! * * this is why people squeeze into that narrow entrance  packed like sardines in there on a cold rainy day    it is worth the wait 
great cheap place!! nice service  they asked me if i could wait 10 minutes so that they could get me a fresh batch of soup dumplings  they wanted me to have fresh dumplings and enjoy it rather than eat 30 minutes old ones  that sort of service is to be appreciated  restaurants usually try to finish stock i recommend the crab and pork soup dumplings 
good place for xiao long bao  sitting can be little tight at some spots but that's pretty much the same as other restaurant around prince street  lovely noodle and cold dishes  keep in mind they takes cash only 
update review   u r in chinese restaurant not for the service   but i ordered shuman this time   it was cold    well they reduce the item price and that's it   their soup is not special     i only like their soup bun  nothing else is special 
lovely food  busy place  get sliced pigs ears  beef scallion pancakes  hot soup dumplings are the best in town  beef tripe is awesome too 
tasty dumplings with a range of options  while not nyc's best  they are good  especially considering the neighborhood's few options  very accessible for those not as interested in a more authentic flushing dumpling experience 
i have been craving xiao long bao (soup dumplings) for months! finally  on a dreadful sunday afternoon  vh and i ventured to flushing and  among other things  wanted to try the soup dumplings at this placeas a starter we shared a salty soybean milk with chinese breadsticks (the breadsticks seemed a popular choice around the restaurant) and fermented veggies  which was perfect for the cold and rainy day (we added some hot sauce to it  though)  we then had a scallion pancake  the pancake came with beef (a mistake on their behalf  but they didn't charge us for the beef)  which was just ok  too much hoisin sauce  and the pancake itself was a bit too oily and heavy the xiao long bao with crab meat and pork are really delicious  the soup is very rich and flavorful  the meat tender and juicy  with a nice texture and perfect consistency  certainly the pork flavor overwhelms the crab (a bit more crab  please   )  but nonetheless this is a great  sinful  hearty soup dumpling the place is pretty small  very busy  and there is no waiting area  which means that if you have to wait for a table you may have to wait in the narrow corridor that connects the restaurant to the street  or in the street  for this reason  i wouldn't recommend for a party larger than 4 
try their food for the first time  try the pork and cabbage soup dumplings  pan fried pork dumplings  and vegetable noodle soup  the dumplings (both) were okay  but the noodle soup was not satisfying  it was too salty for my taste (think it tasted like msg?)
great pan fried pork buns!xiao long bao (soup dumplings) (steamed pork buns on their menu) have so much soup! went with two individuals that were born in china and they both loved it and agreed on the amount of soup  i think their soup dumplings are better than joes shanghai in chinatown braised bean curd is fantastic  has a fresh mozzarella texture  nice spice  the two i went with also really liked the spicy bamboo shoots 
great soup buns  puts joes shanghai to shame   secrets out though as non locals now frequent this place even though there's no english on the awning   least crowded for breakfast  cold soy milk here is my favorite 
found this place looking for a late night bite in flushing  very affordable  fantastic soup dumplings served with tangy fresh ginger seasoned ginger  my boyfriend ordered a dish with minced pork  cabbage  and chewy rice cakes that looked like korean tteokbokki and it was also super yummy  only $13 for our meal  this restaurant is conveniently located in flushing and i will return for sure  highly recommended 
best dim sum place to date! love the scallion pancakes  the rice cakes  and the dumplings! cash only though!
i decided to give this place a try again  originally  i was planning on trying "spicy and tasty" down the block  but they were already closed (and thankfully so because we wouldn't have noticed their c sanitary inspection rating otherwise!) xlb's  a little bland to me  pricey  especially given that they only come six in an order at a higher price than what you'd normally pay for eight elsewhere spicy beef noodle soup  i tried it again and i didn't like it  it was good  just not for me  not very spicy  but the broth did have flavor from the peppers scallion noodles  plain noodles seasoned with some sesame oil and soy sauce  plain and simple with good flavor vegetable dumplings  i didn't get to try these  but my girl who had them said they were good also note  there aren't many vegetarian options  vegetarians  you'll be limited to about three or four dishes at most 
its hard not to compare these dumplings to joe's  this place is good  yes but i like the soup in my dumplings to be big in flavor  and fattier  i really didnt think nan xiang did it for me   but      the other dishes on the menu are freaking amazing  the scallion pancake with the sliced beef is wonderful and so are the seafood pan fried noodles i really appreciate that they have only one misspelling on the menu! yay !
best soup dumplings ever  all the food is actually pretty good  but the dumplings is a must have  i come here all the time  the shanghai nice noodle is great the wait time used to be long because the place was pretty small now it has grown it took on to other stores next to it 
i'm downgrading nan xiang because of the crappy customer service  the last time i came  they were the ones who screwed up an order  they brought the wrong dish  i had taken a bite of the wonton or dumpling (don't remember)  and tasted saw it wasn't the dish we had ordered  then they had the audacity to still charge us for the dish since i had touched it  excuse me? how was i supposed to know that it was wrong without touching or taking a bite? since when does the customer need to pay when the company makes the error?now that they have a solid customer base  they just don't care anymore about keeping their patrons coming 
supposedly the best dumpling restaurant in ny and well  i can't say that i agree  i had  soup dumplings spicy won tons seafood fried noodles scallion pancake shao mai dumplings pot stickersthe vinagar soy sauce is meant for the soup dumplings and were paired well  i loved the seafood noodles and recommend anyone eating here to try it  even though it was pricier than back home at $9 95overall  just okay and not the best i've had 
hands down  best soup dumplings in the city but the rest of the food was a greasy soggy disappointment
nan xiang xiao long bao is well known in flushing as having some of the best little soup dumplings   if you come here after 9 30 a m   you will be waiting for a table   come early  'nuff said  for a short time  i had a small table to myself   as i waited for my food to arrive (about twenty minutes cooking time)  they let a party of two sit at my table   i wasn't sitting in the nicest of tables  closest to the bathroom and near the serving and inside counter  the waitresses were hustling back and forth  causing me not to relax   lots of loud  frantic energy as the ladies rushed around and also rushed you to finish   i saw lots of patrons enjoying noodle soups  rice cake  rice rolls  fried cruellers and dumplings all before 10 00 a m   the xiao long bao or steamed pork buns are freshly made and has thin skin  though i have seen thinner   they come six to an order and a small silver tong is included for $5 50 served on top of cabbage in a steamer   i used my chopsticks instead and tried to mobilize my dumpling but the first puncture happened and a lot of soupy goodness spilled on my plate and another time in the steamer   with only 2 small mishaps  i did pretty good    the thing to do is grab the dumpling gingerly and then place it on your soup spoon   bit a small hole and suck up some of the soupy loveliness  then if you like the black vinegar and ginger  add that and eat the remaining dumpling or you can put vinegar dip on the bottom of your soup spoon and then place the dumpling on top    the meat has nice flavor  i can taste pepper and the soup has a nice sweetness to it   don't let them cool down too much  as the skin tastes a lot better when it is warm   i also had the scallion pancake and it was nicely browned and heavier than i expected   after eating this meal  i wasn't hungry the rest of the day   on another yelping expedition  i had a bowl of soy milk  fried bun with chives and egg and the shanghai shui mai   the fried bun looked like a giant empanada   inside it was filled with chinese chives  small fried egg bits and rice sticks (cellophane noodles)   the filling was a bit on the greasy side and the giant empanada look too limp like it needed lots more filling    the shui mai had a thin wrapper and was stuffed with sticky rice and each shui mai had a pea on top   this one was very bland and dry  i would definitely not order this item again   the soy milk was a great accompaniment to this meal and help me wash it all down  so when a place such as nan xiang xiao long bao has xlb in its name  don't deviate   stick to the steamed soup dumplings   four stars for the xio long bao and soy milk  three stars for everything else and two stars for rushy service 
a word to the wise  if you get here  you're told your wait is 10 15 minutes  and you're handed #18 when they've just called #5   you're going to be waiting a bit longer than that  nan xiang is a popular joint on the weekends  and if there's a crowd  you can probably sneak away and grab a bubble tea or a snack from nearby and make it back before you're called  we made it back just as they called the number after us  but my girlfriend's chinese came in handy and got us seated just as they finished cleaning up a table  service is your typical chinese  although i don't even think the guy who served us had any working knowledge of english outside of the numbers used to sit people  i don't care as long as i get my food  though   this place is noted for their soup dumplings  but honestly   i could take them or leave them  i appreciate the thin skin and hearty amounts of broth that they come with  but i prefer the dumplings to be of thinner skin and to be smaller as well   similar to what's prevalent out in san francisco or some of the smaller joints in manhattan chinatown i've been to  it's also more expensive   you get 6 large ones for $6 50; you can definitely get more for less back on the island  the main reason to come here is the scallion pancake with sliced beef  forget about this place being called a dumpling house; this place knows how to make a freakin' tasty scallion pancake  the dough is much more pastry like in texture in that it's chewy and doesn't come off as overly greasy oily as other pancakes do  throw in tender sliced beef and a heapin' helpin' of hoisin (how do you like that for alliteration!) sauce  and you have yourself three slices of heaven for $3 95  so much win in this dish  and by far the best pancake i've had anywhere to date  the kau fu was standard but pretty good  while the fried pork buns were good  if not as sizeable and juicy as the ones i had at shanghai gourmet in manhattan be prepared to wait a little bit if you come here during prime lunch hours  but it is worth the wait  soup dumplings are good  but the epic win at nan xiang comes from the beef scallion pancake 
this place is cash only which i hate but it is a thing in most places in nyc  we just got the soup dumplings and i have to say that the service was quiet terrible  so i'm glad we didn't get more than one item 
reasonable price  great service  and great food   what more can i ask from a restaurant? their xiao long bao is out of this world   and they have this soy drink which has just the right amount of sweetness to finish off a great meal  definitely recommended 
i don't generally like chinese food (sorry!) but this place is amazing  when food is really done precisely and authentically  you really cannot go wrong it's usually very busy  but i've never had to wait longer than 15 minutes for a table   even when we once walked in with a group of 15 people on a saturday night  i'm still not sure how they were able to accommodate all of us   but they did! and it was great!the menu is straight forward and easy to understand   and pay for  prices are insanely inexpensive  i always get the scallion pancakes  the pork juice buns and the crispy noddles  my fiance (jon r ) does not like the crispy noodles but i am a fan! the texture of crispy  savory  and saucy really does it for me  and of course  don't forget the soup dumpling!forget chinatown  flushing is the real deal  if you want authentic  delicious and a great overall experience   nan xiang is all that and a bag of chips 
i was here on on wednesday 5 1 13 and was a bit disappointed  price is a bit steep now that i've had a chance to really pay attention to it but i suppose that comes along with being located in flushing  in general  things seem to be more expensive in flushing than the brooklyn or chinatown counterparts but you can't really be super picky about it when it comes to soup dumplings  they're kind of a rare commodity so choices are limited    beggars can't be choosers i ordered scallion pancakes which came out crispy (good)  but very greasy and bland  and severely lacking in the key ingredient  scallions!had one order of dumplings (6) which cost about $6 i think  which is not cheap when you compare to joe's shanghai  they came out piping hot and tasted good though also ordered shredded pork with rice cakes  they were extremely greasy (which i've come to expect from rice cakes in general) but the order was ridiculously small  it didn't even fill up the serving plate it came on  other than the grease  it was good service was okay   they came by and refiled my tea and cleared off the empty dumpling tray  what can i say? they did their job  it was the middle of the week  after all  and there was barely anyone in the restaurant total price was about $20 after tax+tip for the above meal which didn't really fill up me and my wife  this place has gone downhill a bit   
i have been here twice and the service sucked both times i went here that every time someone suggest that we go here i refuse to eat here  first time i went here we only ordered xiaolongbao and they even forgot our order so much so that the table who was seated after us had their dishes and xiaolongbao first  it took about an hour for it to come after we asked them what happened to our order which they said they forgot  second time i went here the same thing happened and i was with another person who wanted to try their xiaolongbao  even worst was this place wasn't even busy when they forgot our order  i don't see what's even great about their xiaolongbao  the pork and crab soup dumplings in joe shanghai is more flavorful in my opinion  i was going to give this place another try a few months ago with another person  we saw the rating they had and we went to joe shanghai instead because joe had a better clean rating 
this place is amazing!!! i thought i had the best taiwanese cuisine in la  aka the food mecca  but this beats anything i've ever had out there  the scallion beef pancake is so crunchy and fluffy and the meat used in the spicy beef noodle soup is soft! great price  great food    just     wow   )
i came here expecting a lot because of all the hype but came out slighly disappointed of course  having the name nan shian  you better pull your own weight in the xiaolongbao department and to be honest it wasn't bad   people have been telling me that it is one of the best in ny and if this is the best  then they best get out to la and have a little taste   price is reasonable for xiaolongbao   good juiciness from the meat and they give you the ginger soy sauce mix that cuts into the fatness of xiaolongbao   also tried to crab roe variation   not as strong as i expected but you can still taste the crab i did like their cold side dishes though   pig ear  "fuchifeipian"  and the seaweed were all very delicious   lots of chili oil but don't worry it is more of a mild spiciness   also had the green onion cake beef wrap   i think that was my favorite   braised slices of beef and sauce was good but the crispiness of the green onion cake really makes the dish stand out overall  still a nice spot in flushing for solid shanghainese chinese food but not something that's a "must" for me the next time i'm in ny 
very fresh and hot food  tastier than nyc chinatown and worth the trip from manhattan    the only thing lacking was attentive service  but the waitstaff was friendly when they did appear
great price and really good soup dumplings! got the green scallion pancake with shredded beef and found it to be overwhelming with the sauce  would stick with regular green scallion pancake next time! sweet hot soybean milk was almost as good as my momma's!  )
this is kind of all i day dream about when lunch time comes around and i am nowhere near flushing xlb and beef scallion pancakes were bomb!!i played it safe with these recommended dishes and i wasn't disappointed  there was no room left for dessert but maybe next time i'll go for it  suck it joe shanghai 
you're by roosevelt and main st thinking about what you should eat  asian food of course! i've been wanting dumplings for a while so this place was exactly what i needed  the pork dumplings  pork buns  and scallion pancakes were all pretty good  the portions are big and the prices are negligible  this is a great brunch lunch spot  i don't think i'd do dinner here unless it was to go  it doesn't have the ambiance for that unless maybe it's just you and a bunch of friends 
delicious dumping but terrible customer service!  really bad  may be this is new york standard 
i seriously love this place!   i don't visit as often as i would like to b c i hate the drive to flushing from brooklyn   but whenever i'm in queens it's a must stop for me xiao long bao & scallion pancake w beef are my must haves !   then i wash down all the food with a bowl of warm soy bean milk    yes i said bowl  it's served in a soup like bowl i always go during the late afternoon and never waited more than 10 mins for a table   as for service   it's the same for most restaurants in chinatown & flushing    they seat you  take your order  bring your food  bring your check  period 
food ======$5 50 6 pieces  xiao long baoimmediately  that soup dumpling tasted gooood  but i have no basis of comparison   as that was my first  unless of course i had it in a less extravagant setting (say the basement of the golden mall) for 12 pieces  $3 30  in which case    both were good in their different ways? kudos on their dipping sauce as well; always nice to see some julienne d ginger  decor=======chinese  wooden bamboo  all that goodnessservice======when it's crowded  not so much good service  but when they aren't so harried it's not too bad extra!======  complimentary hot tea
my boyfriend and i went to this place because our favorite chinese spot (lao dong bei) was closed  we were first sat at a table literally that less than a foot away from another couple (we might as well have been sitting at the same table as them)  there were at least 5 other tables open  so we asked to move to a different table  i'm not really sure who the server was  there were two different people helping us  the female server was very unpleasant and inattentive  she was slamming dishes around angrily and forgot one of the items we ordered  the food was alright  i liked the spicy pork wontons (not actually spicy though) and the pork soup dumplings (they are called steamed pork buns on the menu  which kind of confused me but whatever)  overall  i probably won't be back  try lao dong bei for great food and great service  they don't speak much english but you can make it work 
this review is waaaaaaaaay overdue considering the amount of times i've come here for me  this is my benchmark for comparing all other soup dumplings  unfortunately for me  no other soup dumpling place has ever come close to this benchmark so i end up coming here for my soup dumpling fix  if i lived closer  i would put this restaurant as my address because that's where you'd find me  this place is the real deal  ask me about anything else on this menu? don't kid yourself  if you come here and don't eat the soup dumplings  you've just wasted precious moments of your life look  to put it simply   they make their soup dumplings fresh  the broth is really clean unlike other places where they offer very murky tasting soup  their scallion pancake with beef is also really damned good  it can get a bit heavy so i highly suggest you use the red pepper flake hot oil to cut the heaviness  nan xiang dumpling house is just something that is irreplaceable to me  they have a wonderful balance of meat to broth that i have yet to find anywhere else pretty sure this place is cash only  their service is okay at best  their soup dumplings come out slow (because they're fresh) but their soup dumplings are bar none the best thing i've ever had!
the only thing i recommend is the crab pork dumpling  other than that  i tried the beed scallion pancake which had good reviews but it had an old beef and oily  taste  the vegetable dumpling is a waste of money  it was one of the worse dumplings i ever had in my life  i think joe shanghai is much better except for parking  this place is rated c and the restaurant is not the cleanest 
went there for xlb  found another favorite   pork and vegetable wonton in spicy sauce  the sauce is more savory than spicy; it is sesame & peanut oil with soy sauce  unsuspecting combinations of excellence 
don't get me wrong  i love this place  but that might be mostly due to nostalgia  nan xiang is a place i've been going to since i was a tiny tot (well i went to people's people's which sold the same food and was located in the same spot)  i love the food there  but it's definitely gone down hill significantly  here is the timeline of their slow descent  first they were tiny and had the single room which was almost always packed  you had to wait a long time  but the service was great and the food was great  totally worth the wait then they expanded and it was still good  but some recipes definitely changed  the beef wrapped in shao bing became scallion pancake wrapped instead  then the scallion pancake became deep fried and sort of tasteless  their service started going downhill because they have the same waitresses (literally the same)  but triple the number of customers  this meant sitting at a table for 30 min to get plates and tea  then 10 more min to get your order taken  the food still comes out pretty quick  but bland  the salty soy milk was bland  how does that work? the wait staff is  understandably  stressed and really unfriendly  you might have to ask 20 times to get some chili sauce  i might have reached the point where the wait is no longer worth it 
i got the chance to try nan xiang when my mom brought me there for lunch   a few years ago  the place was just the size of one store front  but now due to the popularity of the place  they expanded their seating area to the store next to them and the wait now is not as terrible as before   the restaurant is busy all hours of the day  but not to fret!  the turnover of this place is pretty quick   i think the longest i've wait was about 20 minutes  but it's worth it!!  when you are seated  the very first thing to do is order the xiao long baos!!  they serve 2 types  the original type  and the one with a crab meat mix   each order comes with 6 delicious  juicy dumplings!!  nan xiang's xlbs are definitely the best i've had   other dishes i also ordered (on this visit)  spicy beef and tripe  it's a cold appetizer and super spicy  but so delicious!   the fried pork buns  juicy pork wrapped inside the bun  panfried leaving a crispy bottom! scallion pancakes  light  airy  crispy fried pancakes that just melts in your mouth when you take a bite! rice cake with beef  a bit oily  but the rice cakes were dough and chewing  stir fried with strips of beef and vegetables like carrots and cabbage   a definite must have!i definitely recommend this place over joe's shanghai  cheaper and definitely tastier!!
i'm not saying only shanghainese people know how to make shanghainese food  on the contrary  my favorite place for shanghainese food proves  time after time  to be jade garden  a mammoth chain in shanghai owned by the taiwanese  the source of my favorite xlbs in the world are found in a taiwanese chain  din tai fung (overpriced etc etc  but the crab xlbs are the best anywhere and everywhere)  but all of the failed attempts at shanghainese food (and namely xiaolongbaos) in new york is a disgrace  this is a dump  the food served here (aside from the xlb) is fit for a migrant worker  seriously  this place makes my neighborhood xlb takeout spot in shanghai look like a palace  i ordered jellyfish and seaweed to start  which were the biggest and most offensive mistakes i have ever committed as a shanghainese person  i am trying not to think about what object was actually served in the jellyfish dish  and the seaweed dish was sent back before any damage was done  secondly  how is any of the flavoring in these dishes even remotely shanghainese??? never in my life  i feel like it's insulting that they would even serve this  this is your attempt at shanghainese? it's reduced to this? yeah it was cheap ($5 for jelly fish)  but i would've much rather paid more for a decent plate of jelly fish that isn't piled high like that  or how about you just don't?the xiaolongbaos came next  they were decent  to be fair  i have not had any great xlbs in new york and generally don't like xlbs  maybe from eating too much when i was a kid  the main issue  i think  is the meat  the pork in these dumplings are bland and clearly not fresh  the flavors in the broth owe a lot to the seasoning  which is pretty intense to be fair  but there's no   "xian" in the meat  the skin is on the thick side and the size of the xlbs are way too big? is this super size me? as far as nyc goes  i guess they're an ok option  finally  we ended the meal with pan fried noodles and rice cakes  i liked both of these dishes  but i'll be honest with you  this is one of those restaurants that no shanghainese person would go to if it were in shanghai 
we were on a business trip and friends of my co worker's brought us here   i'm from l a  and the best dumplings i had was at ding tai fung   i wouldn't say nan xiang was better than ding tai fung  but they both have the best dumplings!  we also had some appetizers (jellyfish  beef tripe) and fried noodles and they were good   the place looked clean but i only wish they had a nicer bathroom 
xiao long bao!!!! this is another xiao long bao place other than joe's shanghai   i love this place because they have smaller tables and you don't have to sit in a big round table with different groups of people   it's so hard to share in joe   so i ordered the normal xiao long bao and the crab xiao long bao   both are good   the skin of the dumpling is sooooo thin and you have to carefully grab it without spilling the soup in the dumpling   i don't think i know how to pick it up without failing   so i used my hand instead    p i only failed once out of 6    p my friend failed half of the time   aha    p we also ordered fried shredded chicken rice cake   it's really good and authentic   i am so hungry so i ate quite a lot    love love love it   and it's cheap too    ) can't believe i can get a meal in nyc without paying more than 15 bucks!!! wow!!!!
had high expectations for the shanghai dumplings at nan xiang  being located in flushing and all  but the pork filling had a strange taste that i wasn't quite used to  it just tasted a bit off  like there was a different seasoning or a different cut of pork used  not sure what it was  but i don't think i'd come back here for xiao long bao  you still need some skill to not break the skin when picking it up from the steamed bamboo trays  it's nice that you can see the chefs making the xlb right before your eyes since the dumpling folding station is opened to the eating area  the prices were also very reasonable  which was expected for a restaurant in flushing 
the best soup dumplings i have ever had! i've had it 2x before and 2 other restaurants which were all really good but this place is the best out of the 3 i've tried so far! i highly recommend the pork soup dumplings  it's the most flavorful of them all  we also got the sesame pancake that everybody raves about and it was really good too! all in all  this will now be my go to place for soup dumplings whenever i'm in ny 
best soup dumplings in queens  soup dumplings are new for me  being a white guy  "dumplings" are dumplings has been my pov  how wrong i am  the nan xiang soup dumplings are hand made by a crew in the small kitchen you pass going to your table  the dumpling cover is thin and not doughy like other dumplings  the meat filling is a great blend of "whatever" and tastes great with the flavorful broth inside the packet  the trick   which i have not fully mastered   is to eat your order of dumplings without leaving any soup on your plate  don't go here for the ambiance or to be fussed over by waitstaff  go for the amazing dumplings 
i've been here at least a dozen times and the soup dumplings have been consistently delicious!!!i've had soup dumplings at the famed din tai fung dumpling house (at the original la location) and nan xiang's are superior  they're also a million times better than the sucky ones served at the tourist american trap joe's shanghai  (my ranking  nan xiang   din tai fung  joe's shanghai lagging far behind) the dumplings here are larger than those served at other restaurants so they come 6 to an order instead of the usual 8  the dumpling skin is the perfect thickness (or should i say  thinness!) and hold a mouthful of yummy soup skip the rice cakes here   they're super oily  i'd recommend the appetizer dishes they keep in the front of the restaurant especially the cucumber with garlic and the spicy beef with tripe  end your meal with some hot soy milk and an order of red bean puffs 
wonton good but beware  they are vert skimpy with meat  beef chow fun  $9 95 had literally 6 piece of small cut of beef  the chicken hot pot $9 95 had the same amount of chicken with 5 broccoli and a hugh amount of rice   is never seen a restaurant that is so stingy  you will not get the value they overcharge  the food is okay  but you will feel like your eating vegetables and starch because of their stingyness   not a good value for your money  too bad 
this used to be my go to spot for xiao long baos  but ever since their renovation they've definitely gone downhill  not sure if i can provide an alternative    guess you could always go hang out with the tourists at joe shanghai 
delicious soup dumplings (xiao long bao) and fried soup dumplings (sheng jian bao)  average other food  in a small  clean restaurant with an efficient and friendly staff  i have tried almost all the other well known soup dumpling places and these were the juiciest and most flavorful (we had the pork ones   oops  there i go again rabbi   sorry!)  also take jin y's advice and get two orders because you do only get 6  not 8 pieces per order we also tried the scallion pancakes and pan fried dumplings  if you come here  come for soup dumplings or  fried soup dumplings  the flavor of both are amazing!
best soup dumplings in new york city hands down  besides the pork soup dumplings  i recommend the beef and tripe and or the cucumber cold appetizers  this place is cash only and usually there is a wait for tables  don't expect good or attentive service but do expect warm brothy perfect soup dumplings 
joe's shanghai takes a close second  these are the best i have had outside shaghai  worth the wait  but you dont have to if you get up early enough 
food is yummy as always but the waiters are just unacceptable  we came in and said hi and asked for a table for two  the lady said "in the back" and we walked to the back  another guy yelled at us for walking to the back    when we were finally seated and ready to order  the waitress asked what we would like  as i was talking  she was talking to another table! =___='
def worth the hype and its michelin stars as you can tell by the many reviews for this spot place is authentic  no question you come here get the crab pork soup dumplings  a lot of em price is very reasonable  great value here however  their noodle dishes (particularly cripsy noodles) are very delicious and fresh service can be worked on as are a majority of asian restaurants  but this place is always pretty busy and serving out delicious handmade soup dumplings   be careful they are very hot with lots of tasty steamy broth sauce inside   only neg  no booze if your looking for another appetizer & want to try something you wouldn't see at your normal take out try the spicy beef and tripe  or drunken chicken   cant go wrong here   o yeah remember cash only !
yes this place has the best soup dumplings in the area (and even past the flushing area for which a long while)  it is their specialty   they have 5 people alone making them in the back   if that's not dedication to some great soup dumplings then i don't know what is  if i go  i'll always get the cold appetizers they have in the front (so you can just point if you don't quite know what the menu says)  they are great to share or snack on  and the portions are quite good the pork cabbage noodle soup was surprisingly really good  it's a nice light dish with really nice textured noodles  i usually get this one one thing with the xiao long bao   eat them quickly  the skin will get hard   but be gentle because you do not want to break them otherwise the juice ( which is the point of these little baos) will flow out  they get 5 stars for the xiao long bao but 4 because there are certain dishes that are better elsewhere but   its no a big deal   because the other dishes aren't their specialty  it would be a problem if their specialty sucked  personally  northern chinese food has never really been mind blowing for me  their dishes are good for what they are i'll say that though  i'll always go here if i want xiao long bao but i'll never crave anything else on their menu  that is why its only 4 stars as opposed to 5 
enjoyed the food and service here over and over   great stinky tofu best rice and beef combos around   we got stuck in a rainstorm and stayed for about 3 hours   there is a warm and family feel to the place 
also known as nan xiang xiao long bao  this restaurant is always packed with lines going along the curb outside  why? i had no idea until i finally came here at 9pm on a week night when the crowds were almost non existent  along the strip of small restaurants along prince st   you wouldn't know about this hidden gem unless by word of mouth  situated in this small restaurant is about ~10 tables  with one large 8 10 person table the menu is fairly small so you won't spend a lot of time trying to decide what to order  for our party of 4  we ordered several dishes which the scallion pancakes came out in about 5 minutes  and the remaining dishes in another 5 minutes   scallion pancake with sliced beef ($3 75)   omg  this dish was delicious!! it tasted like pekking duck with the hoisin sauce (sweet bean sauce) but wrapped in indian nan bread  i definitely recommend getting this dish or possibly even two orders  as there are only 3 pieces per order   shanghai pan fried udon ($6 95)   noodles were thick and served al dente  with just the right amount of yummy greasiness   rice cake with beef ($6 95)   rice cakes were soft with a subtle firmness  none of them clumping sticking together  beef was tender and flavorful  this dish was perfect  the sauce not overly abundant  where at other restaurants you can find this dish drowning in sauce   steamed pork buns ($5 50) for 6   we ordered two dishes of trays of this  these small steam pork buns (dumplings) were very tasty with a good amount of juice inside  similar or possibly even better than joe shanghai  be sure when biting into this  to suck the juice out so it doesn't leak all over your dish  pour a little ginger soy sauce on top  and mmm  mmm yummy  and don't forget them as soon as they're served  steaming hot!mmmm  i'm definitely a big fan of this place and could understand why this place can get so crowded  if you do get a chance to check this place out  i definitely recommend getting the xiao long bao (steamed pork buns) and the scallion pancake with sliced beef  these are two dishes that will make your stomach and soul pleasantly happy 
great soup dumplings  scallion pancakes and everything! i especially liked the rice cake and beef  the rice cakes have a really interesting texture  not interesting weird  interesting tasty  and the dish had a lot of flavor  went with 5 people  got a ton of dishes and it was an even $15 each with tip 
i found this place thru youtube video  food was good but service was ehh  i was there with my boyfriend we didnt wait too long to be seated  we got soup dumplings  soy milk andcrispy dough  overall food tasted good  but besides being seated fast waiter wasnt friendly or nice  i would go back for the food for sure 
order the buns!!! order the buns!!! order the buns!!!i was a bit pessimistic about trying this place since i've been a joe's fan for quite some time  but let me tell you  these buns are just as good  if not  dare i say    better than joe's this place can get busy  but you have to talk to yourself and realize that sometimes    good things come to those who wait  you'll be glad you did their homemade soy milk for $1 comes in bowl  that may make you feel like a cat    but don't worry  just drink it! it's good!i ordered sliced pig ear  and it was all i hoped it to be! porky  chewy  soy y  spicy  ear y   if you're one of those people that loves to eat cartilage off the bone of a chicken wing  then you'll like the texture of the ears  fantastic the hot pepper and beef noodle soup is good  and seems like a very popular item  but order the pork or pork and crab buns along side  trust me  they're worth it!
the food are good  the price is reasonable  it is crowded most of time  but that proves this is a good place 
way better than joe shanghai  this place is legit  dumplings are large and savory  the side dishes(cucumber salad) is a perfect addition to the dumplings  if you're into noodles  try their house pork and vegetable noodles  great flavor!
this here is the best xiao long bao  or soup dumplings  in nyc   the lines may be long at times  but it's worth the wait   although i recommend going early in the evening  especially if you are trekking to flushing on the weekends  because the line will stay long for quite a few hours during dinner time   the soup dumplings here have me wondering why the hell anybody actually think joe's shanghai is so great   nan xiang puts joe's shanghai to shame i have been to this restaurant numerous times by now and their soup dumplings have never disappointed   they have two basic kinds   the regular soup dumplings with pork and the crab soup dumplings   the crab soup dumplings are not entirely made of crab  but a mixture of both crab and pork   the sign of good soup dumplings is that when you bite into one even with the slightest of pressure  the soup squirts out   it requires the thinnest of dumpling skins and the right amount of soup inside the dumplings   you will find that if you are not careful eating the soup dumplings at nan xiang  all the soup will fall into your spoon or bowl   what you want to do is bite the top ever so slightly and slurp up the soup everything being said  however  i do not really like the other dishes nan xiang has to offer   i really only go there for the soup dumplings 
totally fantastic soup dumplings!
great xlb  one of the better ones i try in nyc  food taste authentic  i would have 5 stars but my pan fried buns meat inside was not cooked all the way  glad my hubby caught it before my son and i eat it 
so glad there's an alternative in flushing for xlbs! we went for lunch and ordered both the pork and pork crabmeat xlbs  scallion pancake and vegetable noodle soup  the xlbs did not disappoint  i am still a fan of joe's but if the line is too long on any given day  i would highly recommend you check out nan xiang  the scallion pancake and soup were decent but nothing to write home about  bonus  there is a municipal lot right across the street which is convenient 
shanghai specialists    breakfast is crowded   lunch is busy   dinner is crowded  why? because its delicious
thinner skin than joes shanghai and more juice  best in city to me 
this place was a great find! would recommend to anyone craving authentic chinese dumplings and rice cake  my fiance and i got the soy milk  fried dough  pork soup dumplings  crab soup dumplings  and rice cake with veggies  all of it was excellent  fresh  and delicious  the only thing that could have been better was that the soy milk could have been served hotter  it was lukewarm  the price was great  the wait was about 10 minutes on a sunday around noon  the decor was meh  but does anyone go to this type of place expecting ambiance? i embrace the lack of decor as indicative of good  authentic chinese food 
love this place  this is the first place i ever had soup dumplings  about 5 years ago  after hearing about them  i decided to check yelp and find the best ones in the area  these pork soup dumplings are so flavorful and juicy  the best! i've tried them from other places  but these are better  the skin is nice and thin  has the perfect texture  every time i go back i decide to try something new as well  among my favorites are the scallion pancake with beef  the cold edamame salad with some tofu looking stuff  crispy fried noodles  vegetable dumplings  cucumbers  i don't speak chinese so i can't say what the real names are but  everything i've tried is good and tastes fresh  there are closer dumpling places where i live  but this place is worth the drive  compared to other places in the area  the service is good regardless of the language barrier  it also looks and smells cleaner than one of the other popular soup dumplings spots close by 
been to this place a couple of times already and won't stop coming  there is a reason why there's usually a (rather quick moving) line out the door on a typical weekend morning  the shanghai dumplings are delicate  hot soupy explosions in your mouth! our now usual order includes the steamed pork crab dumplings and scallion beef pancakes  tea is poured the minute you sit down with no water in sight  it's a lot of hotness going on and thank goodness they have air conditioning during these summer days or i would melt altogether  4 stars only is for the service which isn't the greatest   in fact actually a bit rude (a server quickly reached over another table to get our check payment)  the tables are very close together and servers are running around and look verrrry busy so it may seem a little overwhelming at first  but the restaurant is popular and man those soup dumplings   are too darn good to miss 
it's a good place to eat and the price has always been good   i discovered this place years before it became popular with other borough people and suburbanites   i sort of wish it was 15 years ago when i didn't have to wait 30 minutes for a seat on saturdays   the dumplings are excellent and i love the scallion pancakes   the service  on the other hand  is not so good   the waitstaff pretty much just hands you the menu  takes your order  then gives you the check   they never check up on you to how you're doing   i have never had one come over to my table and fill my cup with water tea unless i waved at him her   btw they don't speak english   there is one table where they should not seat patrons   it is the table that faces the front door   during the winter cold air constantly hits the patrons at that table as the door is opened and closed by customers 
great food  waiters are friendly  good come out fast  i love the bao here more than another one in flushing  i come here whenever i crave for soy milk and delicious cold appetizer dishes!
omfg  this place is the real deal  i have been to nanxiang long xiao bao twice now and each time did not disappoint  i left feeling full  with delicious authentic chinese food in my belly  and the price simply cannot be beat in new york the first time i went  we ordered pork juice bun  vegetable dumplings  and crispy noodles  all of the dumplings were superb and succulent  but the noodles were not so great  that's when we noticed no one around us had ordered the crispy noodles  and everyone had these thick udon like noodles  we asked the waiter what those were and ordered those instead  and it was divine! even with the added entree  the cost came out to only about $9 a person!the second time we went  we knew not to get the crispy noodles  we of course went for those udon noodles  and also got an appetizer of scallion pancake  the scallion pancake was superb! not too oily and greasy  as i've had it elsewhere  but very delicious  i highly recommend it  and nan xiang!
we were here for lunch around 2 in the afternoon & the place was pretty packed! we had to wait for about 10 minutes to be seated  we ordered the xiao long bao  pan fried dumplings  crispy noodles with chicken  & the beef noodle soup  the beef noodle soup were really good but everything else were just alright  the service were just alright  it was quite annoying when the staff kept on taking our hot sauce away 
4 stars for the food i don't usually eat more than one soup dumpling  but the dumplings here are so tasty  i devour all of them    the beef pancake(not sure if it's how they translate it) is fantastic  it's got a big portion of beef strips with a sweet sauce    the turnip cake is also very tasty when fresh  the turnip strips are in the center of a deep fried outer crust  it's fantastic  i highly recommend it  3 stars for the service  water tea has never been refilled by the waitresses  but the one waiter is highly attentive  no one is particularly friendly  but neither is anyone rudethe location is extremely inconveniencing  it's quite a walk away from main st in flushing  which requires an annoying commute  the few times that i have eaten here were before 10 am on a sunday  thus i didn't have to wait    without being driven here and without having to wait  i would not bother coming here  food isn't gonna make my migraine from the commute and the wait go away 
cheap and absolutely delicious  ordered the oan fried udon  pork and crab steamed dumplings and scallion pancakes with sliced beef  everything was delicious  the dumplings spewed yummy soup  the scallion pancake is porbably the best i have really had so far and the udon was tender and tasty with the right amount of flavor  my meal included 2 ting tsao's and the bill was $25  for 2 peoplr with a grade in flushing  i will be back 
if you know joe's shanghai  then you know there is always a huge line and you'll always feels rushed when you actually are seated   this is by far the best alternative to joe's   the menu is a little more limited than joe's  but really you are going for the xiao long baos (soup dumplings)  for starters  this place has a much friendlier atmosphere the joe's i have been too   oftern times there is a wait  but no longer than 30 mins   tables are also pretty accommodating for groups up to ~8 people   there are all different varieties of people  varying in race and age   to me  that's a sign of a place with a reputation for good food  staff is very helpful and nice   there english is up to par so there is never really any confusion   choices for soup dumpings are pork or crab pork   they come in sets of 6   while joe's come in sets of 8   if you are new to eating xlb's  make sure you ask someone nearby how it's done or you won't get the full effect of the deliciousness that is the xiao long bao  what i find to be the best about these dumplings is that the skin is thinner than joe's which allows you to eat more or feel less full  there are other delicious foods as well  i recommend the scallion and beef pancake   very tasty   my personal favorite and the reason for me going is their spicy tripe and beef   if you like tripe and spicy  this is a flavor orgasm   it is the perfect amount of spicy   which is the reason for the soy bean drink  it helps kill the spice on your tongue 
i admit  the concept of soup and dumplings was tantalizing so i made the trek to flushing and was a bit disappointed  overall  i understand the hype but i just felt everything was a too oily greasy for my liking  i wasn't able to fully enjoy the scallion pancakes or the pan fried noodles or the xiaolongbao without it leaving the taste of oil towards the end of every bite 
awesome soup dumplings  beef scallion pancakes  soup dishes (had vegitarian noodle and pork and bok choy soups)  shanghai udon noodles  and rice cake with chicken  bean curd and soy bean salad 
it was legend     (wait for it)       dary!!! the train that thought he could  could! great chinese breakfast place in flushing  it has both great soup dumplings that rivals and in my book is better than joe's shanghai without all the touristy junk that you want to avoid   but my favorite thing to get here is the taiwanese style breakfast  oh so good! *drools* food so delish  you can't get better than this at least from what i've had and seen in my life in the states   it is so good and worth the wait   i've had everything on the breakfast menu almost but my favorite thing to get is the chinese style scallion pancakes with beef  some hot soybean milk soup and either some chinese fried donuts or the rice roll  anything will be good  i have yet to try their lunch and dinner items to the fullest but i've seen orders an they look as authentic as can be and smells great! we have ordered a dish of clams one time and it was full marks on taste   i can not get passed the breakfast items because they are just that good  you can see the cooks making the soup dumplings from scratch and if you get a peek inside the doors of the kitchen they are making many things from scratch adding more to the freshness and oh so goodness of this location service typical asian service  nothing great with a mix of attitude and wanting to rush you out the door for other customers   it's to be expected atmosphere  they actually have quite a bit of seating  they must have expanded as there is a partition wall dividing two spaces and its not as tight as other places  there is a comfortable divide between customers for the most part   it's clean and has a casual vibe to the restaurant   summary in my book  i will come here every time i can get the chance! the chinese breakfast is to die for and if you want to try something  go for the scallion pancake with beef  it will melt in your mouth with flavor and deliciousness 
always a must go when i'm anywhere near flushing  it's always easy to get a table and the service is quick and efficient  food wise  you can order just about anything here and be satisfied  the spicy beef and tripe is a great cold dish to start with (don't be scared)  as far as hot dishes  the crispy noodles  rice cakes  and u don noodles are all superb  and the scallion pancake with sliced beef might be my favorite thing on the menu  i'm not a huge fan of their shao mai  but the pork buns and fried dumplings are both fantastic  of course  we all know the real reason you're here  the soup dumps  make sure you get the crab and meat  they are among the best in the city  make sure to wash it all down with a tsingtao! the bill always ends up being less than you expect  which is never a bad thing 
very good soup dumplings  relatively large in size and filled with delicious soup   unfortunately  some of them might have been overfilled (or either too thinly constructed) as a couple of our dumplings stuck to the lettuce at the bottom of the basket and eventually fell apart   service is erratic at best and non existent at worst   we were quoted a 20 minute wait for a table for two  but it seemed to go well beyond that estimate   on the flip side  we were quoted a 40 minute wait for the aforementioned dumplings  but they arrived in no more than 15 minutes   i figure we either got someone else's order or they misquoted the time to discourage folks from ordering them   all in all  i can't complain too much when the final bill is $16 50 before tip for 12 very good soup dumplings and 2 bowls of soy bean milk soup (which were decent) 
over rated   nasty attitude like they dont need your business  over 30mins for a simple takeout   never coming back 
the dumplings were great! similar to shanghai joe's  i also enjoyed the side dishes of tofu  i would swear that one of them was chicken but it wasn't  i would  definitely go back 
was expecting much much more based on the raving reviews on yelp   trekked an hour into flushing with four other friends  and left feeling grossly full on grease 1  food  meat soup dumplings  scallion + beef pancakes  scallion pancakes  spicy wontons  taro puffs  red bean puffs  sweet soy  and one nod to healthy veggies  braised tofu + soy beans   definitely better dumplings at shanghai cafe in manhattan   the ones here were unexpectedly dryer and bland   the rest of the food was just greasy   no more cheating on shanghai cafe!2  service  we were seated without the entire party being present  which was cool   waitresses dropped menus  and scowled when we ordered or asked for drinks 3  atmosphere  like a factory   in  eat  out 
good dumping here! came here with my family on saturday  it was packed and people are eating the soup dumping  this place reminds of eating in street of china  remeber eat slowwwwwwly don't burn your upper month 
rude waitress to start with  i don't go to a restaurant to be treated like this  "go outside to wait  go out " when i ordered dumplings  i was told to wait for half an hour  after the wait  the dumplings were too sour and salty  totally not worth the waiting  i will never come back! never!
i went here because it was recommended by a doctor of mine and wow  what a treat  i got the pork dumplings to start   which after having these i fear all over dumplings may fall short  then i tried the beef with crunchy noodles as a main dish  i have never had anything from a chinese restaurant that tasted like this  i generally don't head out to flushing but may have to go back if all the food tastes as good as this!  they do not take credit cards! just a friendly tip   thanks for reading an enjoy 
the scallion noodles are full of greasy  flavorful  pan fried goodness and the pork crab xiao long bao here are good  although i personally prefer joe's more   the soup isn't as flavorful here but the skin is thinner and they are served steaming fresh and hot   get a quart of the fresh soymilk and you have yourself an authentic shanghainese brunchl  the wait can be pretty long on weekends but that's part of the charm of flushing   definitely worth a visit 
i go through periods of different food obsessions  right now  it's french macarons  pimientos de padron  and soup dumplings  i love soup dumplings because they're like presents waiting to be opened on my birthday  i see their beautiful wrappings and i try to gingerly open them with my teeth  but when i get a taste of what's waiting inside  i rip them apart to finally get to the soup and crab and pork treasure nan shain's soup dumplings are delicious  the creme of the crop  i crave them every night and i'm so disappointed they don't deliver to hell's kitchen! i love everything i've tried here   the scallion pancake  the noodles  the soups  it's my favorite chinese spot in flushing for those amazing soup dumplings  and it's totally worth the wait 
expected good crab flavor from the crab dumplings based on other yelp reviews   however  there was little to none  chicken pan fried noodles were tasty  not too oily  the scallion pancake with beef was somewhat thick   would prefer more crunch  overall  however  everything was tasty  so i can't complain (any more than i already have) 
food was amazing  everything as advertised in previous reviews
food is good  service is rude   typical i walked in the door wednesday before thanksgiving for lunch and was immediately yelled at to get out of the way  as i'm moving aside  the hostess raises her voice at me because i didn't immediately respond to her question about how many were in my party  i step closer to respond and i'm again yelled at to get out of the way by another server  they really like to yell here to make you feel welcome our actual waitress was sweet though and didn't rush us when ordering which was a refreshing change (it irks me that ordinary service standards become exceptional in chinese restaurants) we ordered some cold appetizers when we sat down  but the server who we ordered from forgot until halfway through the meal  when we said we still wanted it  she goes  "really?!" uh  right back atcha bonquiqui  rude food recs   sweet soy milk (or savory if you like accessories in your drinks)  scallion pancake with beef and bean paste sauussss  fried rice cakes   any of these are stellar but i especially like the one with winter cabbage and pork  pork xiao long bao  duh (i'm not as much a fan of the crab mix one)   skin is super thin and prone to breakage  so handle with care  finesse is the name of the game the chive flat buns (what are these called??) were deep fried instead of pan fried  so i'd skip these if you're about authenticity overall  would go back for the food as long as i keep out of people's way and immediately yell out my party number  two can play this yelling game ** bring cash 'cause cards aren't accepted ** may have to share tables with strangers  get friendly 
often times  chinese restaurants (the authentic ones) can be a cacophony of chaos  noise  grease and starch   even some of my favorite places in chinatown  such as big wongs or shanghai cafe will sacrifice customer service and quality for speed   profit = turning tables as soon as possible nan shian is relatively zen to its more expeditious brethren   the food comes slowly; really slowly  but the quality is remarkable case in point   the glorious xiao long bao or soup dumplings   nan shian takes these beautiful little dumplings seriously  almost to the point of religious reverence   they are hand made and steamed to order  ensuring a good 15 20 minute wait for your food   add this wait to the inevitable wait at the door  and you're committing yourself to a solid 1 hour+ for your dining experience is an hour wait worth it?  let's just say that i would burn cities to the ground for a half dozen basket of the juicy morsels   i would move mountains and conquer empires for just a taste of hot pork broth  wrapped in delicate dumpling dough   an hour's wait seems like a fair trade off to the alternative 
tried their pork xlb and honestly i didn't think that it was that much more exceptional then many other good places in flushing   the only possible difference is that this place might be a slight less oily  the savory soy bean milk was good but the scallion noodle was bland and unflavorful 
this is my favorite xlb place  i've been eating here for a few years and the xiao long baos never disappoint me  this place is way better than joe's shanghai for those who are deciding where to go for xiao long baos  this place serves other excellent dishes  i really like the rice cakes and and scallion pancakes  my favorite drink is the hot soy bean drink  it is a comfort drink  )the only slight problem with this place is the waiting  it really depends on the time and day of when you go  it is always pack at night which is pretty obvious  if you do not mind the waiting for good soup dumplings  i suggest going to nan xiang dumpling house 
the food is pretty good and pretty decent and it is open late! how can i complain  their soupy dumplings need a little more msg and a little more cocaine  but all in all  pretty good  just kidding about the msg and cocaine    i'm sure their food doesn't need any of that  i have never been disappointed by their food! it is also a really big place  so i never have to wait for seating  the prices are also very reasonable  i love this place!
worth driving out from manhattan for  we come out here about once every six weeks in my opinion much much better xiao long bao than joe's shanghai  and they haven't declined in quality since expanding cucumbers with garlic are refreshing  and the beef and tendon is delicious as well the scallion pancake is not my favorite however  chewy rather than flaky come here later (after 830) if you don't like waiting  and there's a conveniently located  but sometimes annoying public parking lot right across the street 
this is the best place the city has to offer for soup dumpling! (at least right now)  joe's shanghai can not compare  a close second would be shanghai cafe in chinatown  the pork buns are good  but the crab meat buns are the highlight  the other items on the menu are decent   they make good cold starters and a yummy chive box 
i've been to this place many times  sometimes it can get very busy so there may be a wait but most of those times its worth it  the soup dumplings arent the only thing thats good here  i also like the sliced been scallion pancake and the spicy pig ears  so good!
definitely my go to place for my crab meat dumplings with the bf! we always go to the chinatown ones in manhattan before we had a car and back then  those tasted really good  until my mom took me here a few years back and i fell in loooove lol  then i took him here and its always our go to place if we ever needed a soup dumpling fix things we usually order usually 2  3 orders of the crabmeat dumplings ( the waitress there was surpised that we finished it + other orders   the dumplings are like crack   we can never get enough =]  the soup lately has been super flavorful and more delicious than before for some reason  also the soup is very clear and not the fatty looking ones from other restaurants cold appetizer of the gluten and the vegetable mix   you can actually mix 2 of the apps in the plate and they only charge you for the price of one plate! which is good if you just want a smaller portion for yourself  you just need to tell them and they'll do itcabbage and pork noodle soup   i dont like cabbage but with the noodiles and the soup    i could eat it all daythe service is actually getting better ( maybe because we always know what we want to order before we even sit down)  and the wait isn't that bad when i was here twice this month  actually had seats once we came in 
overall the food was pretty good  i would recommend the crunchy noodles with chicken and scallion pancakes  very tasty!
soup dumpling place that is pretty good! comparable to joe's shanghai  some of my friends actually like it more than joe's shanghai  i feel like it's up to par  the broth is flavorsome  the pork and outer wrap is of quality  the soup dumplings are good  their other dishes  such as pancakes  and fried noodles aren't too bad either  it's your standard soup dumpling place  if you're craving it  and you're in the area  give it a try 
the food is amazing here! they have the best soup dumplings in all of flushing  i've been here twice and have tried their pork and pork & crab soup dumplings  both will hit the spot  i've also had their noodles in a black bean sauce with beef which is also really good  an order of soup dumplings and noodles is enough for two to share  also  there can be a line for this place majority of the time but it's so worth the wait 
great food at an excellent price  ordered the steamed pork dumplings  scallion pancakes with beef  beef and tripe  shanghai noodles  and seafood noodle soup  the dumplings  pancakes and shanghai noodles were fantastic  the seafood noodle soup came out dry with crispy noodles   something might have gotten mixed up in the kitchen   but i would not recommend this dish whatever it was  service was great  you won't find any americanized chinese food at this restaurant so almost all your choices will be delicious 
i discovered this place and have never returned to joe's shanghai since!best soup dumplings ever!  the bowls of fresh noodle soup are very good too  huge portion for a cheap price   soups and noodles are freshly made   i recommend the crab & pork soup dumplings  the fried chive & egg dumpling  and pork & fresh cabbage noodle soups   the cucumber & garlic appetizer is simple but refreshing as well   you can see the ladies working hard to make the fresh soup dumplings  they even have timers that continually go off (a little annoying)   this place is small and they take their time making the soup dumplings  they typically come out as the last dish of your meal   but well worth the wait!  what i really enjoy about it is that they don't make you dehydrated and  lips sticky because they don't use as much msg as joe's   they do use msg  just not as much   how do i know this?  i just know  chinese people can't not use msg   my stomach could do without it though 
their xiao long baos are good  and thats it
yes their soup dumpling is delicious but compared to joes shanghai it isn't the best in nyc in my opinion  for me it would have to be the one in chinatown green bo  however  i don't go to chinatown ever so often so this place is a great alternative  besides the soup dumpling they have mainly "appetizers"  small dishes for you to pick on  they also have soups and noodles  my boyfriend and i are into trying new stuff  well he is  whatever he orders i pick on it  he ordered jellyfish  yes sounds nasty but its delicious when cold  great place for lunch but not for dinner as i like my rice this is a great place to take close friends not dates in here because there is a certain way to eat these little bad boys without burning your tongue or getting it on your clothes  when entering this restaurant there is a display of cold foods and the hostess will seat u in another room  the decor and space is nice compare to joe shanghai which is located next to the garage and is a bit cramped  this place might be small but it is delicious and cheap!
so my elite friend turned me on to this place   yummy yummy yummy!! this place is very authentic  i never ordered my friend usually does  but the staff seems nice and will help you  if you are in a rush order the soup dumplings as soon as you sit  soup dumplings take a long time to come out but they are well worth the wait  you can actually watch the women making them in the front of the resturant  i like the turnip puffs  they are a simple little dessert or snack  the cucumber salad is a nice start  you can pig out and get the fried pork buns  which are one of my favs  i also get the crispy noodles with chicken  which i like because it a nice change from regular noodles 
ordered dumplings & was told that it would be a 15 20 minute wait   that seemed a little excessive  but i agreed and headed outside to wait   after 15 minutes  i came back inside and the cashier told me my order wasn't ready yet   i stood around awkwardly waiting  in full view of the cashier   some guy who ordered after me got his take out   then a family who had been sitting at a table for all of 10 minutes while i was sitting inside waiting got their dumplings   i went up to the cashier  who had made eye contact with me a least a half dozen times since telling me 20 minutes before that my food wasn't ready yet   she exclaimed  "maybe this is yours " and went in the back room to get a take out bag that had been sitting on the shelf   gee  thanks after all that  the vegetable dumplings tasted so overwhelmingly grassy that i only ate half the order   the other diners' food looked really tasty  but i'm so unhappy with waiting almost 40 minutes for some dumplings that i don't think i'll go back 
loved the dumplings!! way better than joe's  these dumplings actually taste fresh  you cant go wrong with the dumplings and scallion pancakes  during peak hours it does take a little while to be seated  but no longer than 15 to 20 minutes  you need to get the waiters attention if you want anything  service isnt very attentive  but in my case i like not being stalked every few minutes 
the most crucial ingredient to any soup dumpling is the skin  it's supposed to be thin but strong  so that you can pick it up easily without losing that precious  boiling hot juice inside  and when you eat it  it's the skin that provides the chewiness to counter the softness of the moist pork  you can imagine my disappointment when nearly all of the dumplings i ordered broke open  as i tried to move them onto my soup spoon  it was a clear sign that things were not the same anymore  that wonderful  pliable skin that i loved in my past review was gone as i sat at the table right next to the dumpling station  i watched the toil of the three most important people at nan xiang  the three women who make every single dumpling every day  i thought about how i've never seen their faces  only their backs  since they never seem to turn away from their work  and of course  i kept thinking about the dumplings 
nan xiang dumpling house is known for their soup dumplings   the skin of the nan xiang dumpling is slightly above average   for me  the skin of the soup dumplings is very important   it must be thin  so that it doesn't make the dumpling too doughy tasting   but it still must be strong enough to bear the weight of the soup inside and not break   it also needs to have a slightly elastic texture which does not get soaked and soggy  the skin here isn't super thin  nor does it hold very well   you'll probably break a few dumplings here  and soup will spill   if you let them get cold  the break rate will go up to like 50% because they will stick to the trays   the soup flavor is light  and not as greasy as most other places   whether or not this is "better" is subjective   some people like saltier and greasier   some don't   i like their plain pork dumplings  but their crab meat ones leave something to be desired  as there is barely a hint of any crab flavor   other things i like to order here are the red bean cake  spicy beef and tripe  cucumber and garlic as appetizer dessert   and usually crispy fried noodles as the main filler 
my friends and i were planning to eat in flushing before the mets game  and although we browsed the nearby food court (which had many vendors selling amazing food)  we ultimately decided to walk a few blocks to nan xiang  i wasn't sure what to expect since my experiences with chinese food on the east coast so far have been less than stellar   but everything turned out really really good  +` scallion pancakes   4 5   i typically like the bready flaky kind of scallion pancakes (not the deep fried kind)  but this had a very interesting exterior which i haven't tried before    really enjoyed it +` shanghai dumplings   5 5   there's a reason we got 2 orders of shanghai dumplings    they were bomb! for once  the dumplings did not break apart as you picked them up which means you get to slurp up that soupy interior before devouring the remaining dumpling!+` vegetarian dumplings   5 5   we also got 2 orders of this  and although i prefer dumplings with meat  these were still delicious and on par with the shanghai dumplings +` chive and egg bun   4 5   the exterior of this fried bun was very similar to that of the scallion pancakes  different from what i'm used to  but still deliciously crunchy  the interior chive and egg mixture was good  but i've had better   +` spicy beef noodle soup   3 5   noodles tasted really good with the hearty broth  but dood  where's the beef? i think we had a couple strands of beef here and there    you serious? why you holdin' back?overall  great food and price    i think we spent around 35 bucks (w o tip) for 3 people? now that is a freakin' deal 
if you a big fan of soup dumpling  i would highly recommend nan xiang  their dumplings are made fresh to order  usually the wait is about 15 minutes for it  the dumpling is tasteful and very soupy; so you'll need to be careful eating it since the soup might just get everywhere  everything else there are pretty good also  i love their cold appetizers like spicy beef and tripe and cold cucumber  also love stir fried noodles and rice cakes  delicious!however  don't have high expectations of the service  the waitress are rude  if you don't speak up they'll yell at you 
the flavor of the  is so good! you have to be really careful because the skin is so thin   don't waste the flavorful soup!  from what i hear  its virtual suicide to try to go on weekend cause lines will be ridiculously long 
4 5 stars!came here on a thursday for a late lunch and ordered their pork and cabbage noodle soup  i really wanted to order their "xiao long baos" too  but i would not have been able to finish all that food  therefore  i opted not to  next time for sure!long awaited  my lunch finally arrives  my first thought as i bite into the noodles was   soft  tender  smooth and quite   "perfect"! my experience so far has been a positive one so i will definitely come back when i'm in the area 
question of the week  is it better than joe's? answer  imo  it's close  but no why?i've heard many many reviews of this place boasting its superiority against joe's  friends  family  coworkers  finally i decided  why the heck not  the dumpling itself was smaller  and took longer to be served  the meaty portion inside was less  and can i just mention they break apart so insanely easily when you are trying to pick them up and onto your soup spoon  we ruined about four alltogether  and no  we are not soup dumplings noobs! the taste itself was great  very similar to joe's and had this delicious sweet zing to it  if i had never tasted joe's  i would say these are the best  but i will never betray joe's ever again! maybe one day i want to try shanghai cafe though   overall  joe's is bigger  meatier  and tastier also we ordered the seafood crispy noodles  it was okay  wish it came with brown sauce instead of this lobster sauce type of gravy  needed a generous dose of hot chili paste to keep it down 
good call on a rainy sunday evening  my friend and i ordered the scallion pancakes with beef  pork soup dumplings  and the beef with rice cakes  and seriously  everything was delicious  flavors were spot on  no blandness  no lack of anything  portions were good size  savory  tasty  i could go on  and it's cheap too  i would definitely go more often if i lived closer 
greatest soup dumplings in nyc! however  they lack in other food kinds  their regular dumplings are just mediocre  and if you have a peanut allergy    you may die 
this is one of the better places for soup dumplings in flushing   worth the wait   there's a line every night 
found it on the yelp app before a mets game trying to find a quick and good bite  so glad we did  had shanghai noodles with steamed pork buns and veggie dumplings  more than enough for two people  and with bottomless pots of tea too! it all came to less than $20  the noodles were out of this world awesome  i naively thought the pork buns would be like the doughy bbq esque filling i've had for dim sum brunches  but they were still good albeit a bit flimsy and most of the filling fell out if you tried to pick it up  but all in all  ill be going there again before a mets game when i'm in the area 
very good  i don't eat pork so the selection was a little slim  the veggie dumplings were amazing  i'm so full but i want more of the dumplings 
while not the best xiao long bao in ny   certainly one of the top  the skin was thin and insides flowing with soup   delicious food + good sized portions  the scallion pancakes were actually fluffy and not squished flat and full of grease  also i really enjoyed the cold cucumber dish with garlic  sesame oil and parsley  will have to make that at home   service is what you expect from a local asian restaurant but clean  casual and stuff your face for $12pp  what more can you ask?
definitely one of the better establishments in flushing's food scene  simple menu  clean  and good customer service 
with a breezy saturday afternoon (thank goodness the heat wave is gone) and a strong craving for warm soup dumplings  the devour ny team headed to flushing to try the famous soup dumplings from nan xiang dumpling house given its location in flushing  we were expecting a small  quaint dumpling shop  but instead we found a large eatery    they are definitely occupying at least three storefronts  and boy was business strong at twelve o'clock noon  people were waiting inside; people were waiting outside  but luckily with all the tables  turnover was quick  and we ended up waiting only ten minutes starving by the time we sat down and enchanted by the smell of all the food around us  we quickly ordered what we came here for  the soup dumplings  however  with such an extensive menu  we could not just stop there  we proceeded to order the rice cake with pork  wonton dumplings  and vegetable dumplings as well the soup dumplings were absolutely decadent  juicy  plump  and with a thin skin and proportionate meat  it was absolutely perfect  exactly what we hoped for  stick with the traditional kind    the variations are still good (i e  crab)  but nothing beats the original recipe of tastiness the rice cake with pork was fairly good as well  though i have probably had better elsewhere  while the rice cakes were cooked to tender chewiness  the sauce was a little too heavy  and too salty after a while normally vegetable dumplings are one of my favorite chinese dishes    however the ones at nan xiang dumpling house simply could not compete  the skin's texture was too thick and too rough  and the vegetable insides was dry and lacked overall flavor our final dish  the homemade wonton dumplings  faced similar disappointments as our vegetable dumplings  fortunately the hot soup helped to soften the skin  and the seaweed added some additional flavor  we did wish the meat inside was a little more tender    it was a bit too chewy 
the scallion beef pancakes  mwah  delicious  they have just the right amount of hoisin sauce inside the pancakes  haven't had anything like this anywhere else in nyc  the soup dumplings were pretty tasty as well  soup base is fresh tasting and light  staff was also friendly  oh  the soy bean milk was also really good  tastes of sweet childhood soy bean milk  homemade and loaded with deliciousness   definitely worth checking out!
the soup dumplings here beat joe shanghai's hands down! the crab ones actually taste like crab and are so good! while a little more pricey than joe (6 vs 8 pcs and a dollar ish more)  it's so much more worth it the pan fried dumplings here are really good too  fried perfectly golden brown unlike other places that sometimes serve them near burnt  although lines can go out the door during peak hours  the wait is usually not too terrible unless you have a big group with you  i appreciate how you're not rushed even when it's busy  allowing you to further enjoy your meal 
every time we come to flushing  this is the one of places we eat  soup dumpling  hands down  best i ever have in my life  i grow up in shanghai  i can not even find better soup dumpling in shanghai for every year i visit there 
i really only come here for the soup dumplings bc joe shanghai is always too pack  they always mess up our order   always  the dumplings tho are pretty good  if your super hungry and want hella carbs   this is the place for you!
overall their food is good  but prepare to wait for a long line when you visit for breakfast or dinner  it might tasted better for tourist  however i live around flushing so there are other alternatives for me when they are busy 
nice and clean  food is really close to original chinese style  5 stars!
great soup dumplings and scallion pancakes! the pricing is great  becareful when you bite into the buns because the soup can burn  sometimes when i pick up the buns the skin breaks and the soup is lost  the pancake is flakey and crispy and very yummy  it is cook just right and not too oily  there is a long wait time for dinner but it is worth it  i don't like how when you are seated they ask already what you want to order  the waiter was explaining how the buns are so popular that you have to order it the sec you get seated or else you will have to wait long  seating is very tight and i hate it when the tables are so close together  not recommended for a hangout place with friends while trying to catch up  it is good for a quick sit in for dinner or lunch then go 
dumpling mania  oh the warm delicious soup inside those thin skinned pork dumplings   so good there is so much soup in each dumpling that the spoon is not big enough which resulted in a rather tragic soup flood  the loss of the succulent broth really is unfortunate   i need to experiment with the menu  limited as it may be   who needs variety when you do what you do so well  loved the shanghai noodles  fried noodles and the scallion pancake with beef(slathered with hoisin)  i need to try the rice cake and some of the soups  there was a line the first time i went but it went really quickly 
great experience here  i wish there were more vegetarian fish options! highly recommend the fried bun with chives and egg  the vegetable dumplings were pretty much all scallion  i ordered the shao mai and it had ground meat (i was expecting the usual shrimp shumai  oops)  all dishes were good and i'd order them again! i loved that there was no rush to turn over the table  low prices and big tea cup 
best xiao long bao outside of shanghai best spicy beef tendon in ny (so far)noodles in scallion oil is mouthgasmic if you live with in a 1 hour trip of flushing  you have to go here 
yum!  i might be slightly biased since this restaurant serves some of my favorite foods ever and i can't get any of this in michigan  but this place made some really good renditions of these dishes   we had   xiao long bao (pork soup dumplings) with crab on top   so good   perfect amount of soup  and of course there was ginger and black vinegar on the side   for newbies  pour some black vinegar over the ginger slivers   carefully pick up a dumpling from the top with your chopsticks or the tongs  taking care not to break the dumpling skin  and put the dumpling inside your soup spoon   bring the soup spoon up to your mouth  break open the skin  and drink the soup   then put some vinegar soaked ginger on top of the dumpling and eat it   )  beef and scallion pancake   hell yes!  this is one of the most awesome sandwiches ever   the scallion pancake was pan fried perfectly  and the beef inside was tender   they added sauce as well   you tiao   i made the mistake of not eating this right when it arrived at the table  so it was cold  heavy  and greasy by the time i got to it   sweet soy milk (hot)   the best way to drink soy milk is a big bowl of this stuff   so comforting and warm with just a little bit of sweetness i wanted to order a lot of other things  but this was the first stop on my inaugural flushing food crawl  so we kept it pretty light   i want to go back!note  cash only 
the food is pretty good and the service is pretty quick as well   i recommend the soup dumplings (all of them are good) and the beef scallion pancake and some hot sweetened soy milk   my family is chinese and we've had a lot of chinese food  and this is definitely a good place to go to  the food is authentic and delicious this place is always busy  there is always a full house in here   sometimes you can just walk in and get a table  other times you might have to wait a little while the crowd also varies from your typical chinese restaurant  there are families  older folks  teenagers  college students   good mix the prices are very good as well  you really get your money's worth!
i think this may be the only  place in flushing (not including dim sum halls) that we have needed to wait for a table  i always have to order turnip cake if i see it on the menu; their turnip puffs were small  flavorful  and with much less grease than others i have eaten  really really great little bites  my family and i were nervous about trying the xiao long bao    joe's shanghai has been our soup dumpling stomping ground for over 10 years  we felt like we were having an affair  we came to the consensus that the crab version here is better than joe's but joe's pork dumpling is superior 
the best soup dumplings (xiao long baos) you can get in new york city! currently  at least  seriously though  i've been around the block and have seen places with good soup dumplings come and go (including j  shanghai)  this place is the best place to get them in nyc right now and it's been the best spot for several years now  aside from soup dumplings  they're other foods are all very well made and tasty  rice cakes  noodle soup  pancakes  etc are all good picks  you can't lose when you come here!
i stopped by nan shian with my parents and wanted to compare their xiao long bao with joe shanghai's   behind the register  along the side of the dining room  you can see two women toiling away wrapping xiao long bao   when we first arrived there was only 1 woman wrapping xiao long bao and i'm guessing that is why it took a long time for our orders to come out   i'm not sure how they keep up with the orders when the restaurant is hopping so how do the xiao long bao compare?  unfortunately  not well   maybe it was an off day  but i thought the taste was off   maybe too sweet   i couldn't really put my finger on what was wrong with it  but joe shanghai's is still the champion i do recommend getting the turnip cake   they are small  like a bite worth  but they are really good   much better than joe shanghai's   they should be a bit bigger  but i'll look past it since the shredded turnip inside was still moist and had a good strong flavor the scallion pancakes were not very good   there was no scallion flavor at all 
after i found out about this place  i told m and k we must come here to eat their soup dumplings k got the cold bean curd tofu dish   k thought this was really good  but m and i both thought it was to damn salty  od on the salt here!m and i got the crab and pork soup dumplings   the wrapping is super thin  which i love and appreciate  but the filling is not as good as joe's  i actually prefer joe's better than nan xiang  i didn't get to try the pork version  but so far the crab & pork version is better at joe's the wait for this place is crazy!
i so wish i could give nan xiang another star   i just loved the soup dumplings   but it took so long for them to arrive  the staff is a bit disorganized   they gave away my dumplings to the next table and several others were served before us as well  i understand there is a language barrier  but nothing arrived quite the way we ordered it  much to the disappointmnent of my vegetarian non shelfish eating friend who missed out on fried rice cakes (i ate plenty)  sweet soy milk i didnt really understand  and i regret not ordering the scallion pancakes  next time  i still loved it  the dumplings are as fun to eat as they are delicious  and i must say they held up as leftovers 
i've been to this place a few times  although i loved joe shanghai's soup dumplings growing up  i feel like it fell off since it got overhyped  so now  i definitely think this place rivals joe shanghai's soup dumplings this is a typical chinese restaurant  small  loud  and fast service  during busy hours  you might have to wait a bit depending on the size of your group  but wasn't that big of a deal of course the obvious thing to get is the soup dumplings (pork obviously)  and you order a noodle dish as an entree  i usually just order an entire order of soup dumplings for myself and a salted soy bean milk soup  the soup dumplings is definitely meets expectations  served hot and steaming  so heed caution when initially eating it  it was really juicy and the broth inside was orgasmic with fatty goodness  the usual vinegar w  ginger condiment compliments it well  there is so much i can say about how good the soup dumplings are  so go out there and order some now!
i ate here last week with my bf and his friends  the food was pretty mediocre and wasn't as flavorful as the last time i ate here  worst part was when my bf took a bite out of the fried gluten and spit out a hard object leaving a clanking sound on his plate  i asked him what that was and he said it looked like a screw  seriously a screw?! he could have cut his mouth or chipped his tooth if he wasn't too careful  told the waiter about it and he didn't even apologize for it  i am really disappointed at this place and do not understand why tourists are flocking here or why people claim this is better than joe's shanghai 
cheap  yummy  and filling! hit this up after spa castle   i loved the veggie dumplings  my fiance devoured the pork dumplings   we also ordered dumplings with brown rice and mushrooms  this place is all about the dumplings  we ordered the crispy beef noodles and they were huge  it made me scared to order the seafood noodles   the scallion pancake was good though a bit thicker  and chewier than what i usually get at grand sichuan on 7th avenue in the village   the taro buns were not my favorite  too much dough for me   the hot soy milk was a nice treat from the cold outside   it is huge and served in a big bowl  i felt like a cat until they gave us two laden spoons and two smaller bowls   i ordered the sweet bean curd and then realized that i was on soy overload all of that food and out for 30 bucks   plus some warm tea 
after watching bourdain's shanghai episode i got a re awakened hankering for some soup dumplings and found the motivation to travel all the way out to flushing from the les  i wouldn't do so again  the service was mediocre at best  which i guess is to be expected  it's tough to get the wait staff's attention  i'm not sure if they didn't see me or were just willfully ignoring me  the scallion pancake was cooked nice  as it was crispy  but it was thicker than i like  i also noticed that it didn't contain very many scallions  the xiao long bao soup dumplings were ok  but in my view these are not any better than those at joe's shanghai  i wanted half pork and half crab but they couldn't do that  so i got a full order of the crab ones  i had to pick quite a few bits of crab shell or cartilage out  which was not cool  i don't remember having that experience at joe's  yes  they were tasty  but they don't live up to the hype imo 
don't get too excited  better than a sharp stick in the eye  but pretty average by chinatown standards  soup dumplings are good  scallion pancake is delicious  avoid the seaweed salad 
i hate this place  on two different occasions  i have gone there and it has sucked  the customer service was terrible  after 50 mins of waiting  my friend and i were still didnt get out plate of steam buns  other tables that were there after us had finished eating already  we consistently asked them what was going on with all the waiting and the waiter didnt even bother to look our way  when one waiter finally came over  he kept telling us rudely "in one moment'  well i guess "one moment" turned into an hr before we had to rush back to work  i would rather go to joe's shanghai where the service is fast and efficient and the waiters actually listen to you  will never go back 
as good as din tai fung without the rush  great food  excellent prices  be ready to wait on line 
first time i've had soup dumplings outside of asia and it was pretty good  but they still can't beat din tai fung! my eating companion said joe's shanghai had better crab and pork dumplings because they include more crab meat though  i'll have to try and compare next time!we also got sweet soybean milk  dou hua (sweet tofu)  and beef wrapped in onion pancake with sweet hoisin sauce  all pretty standard fare  quite delicious  the beef in onion pancake seemed like a beef version of a peking duck wrap   9
such a limited menu but so delish  my favorite obviously is the steamed pork bun  though with its richness i usually can eat a max of 4  the other must get is the beef with chili soup noodle  the rich beefy brothy with a hit of kick from the green chili is a must get on a cold wintery night  other must is 'nian gao' with pork  not sure how they do it but has such a fragrant fried flavor that one can not replicate at home  such a simple dish but oh can be so fulfilling  their other little appetizer dishes are really quite flavorful and great complement to the meal   there are too many to list but i would try them all 
i love the soup dumplings!!  i used to go to joe's for soup dumplings a lot  but after i tried them at nan xiang  i stopped going to joe's   the soup dumplings here are better   in my opinion  it's a bit less salty  which is a plus for me   i've tried both the pork and crab pork  and the crab pork is my fave   the scallion pancakes with beef  pan fried beef & rice cake  and spicy wontons are really good here   i love the bowl of soy milk with fried dough   yum!!the place is small   seating is pretty limited; so  if it's busy  there can be a wait   and it can feel a bit cramped inside   the servers are not exactly friendly or unfriendly  but whenever i needed anything  they would get it for me immediately   the decor is simple  just like any other restaurant in flushing   because of these reasons  i would actually give this place a 3 5 stars  but since i can't give half stars and since the food is really good here  i couldn't give this place a 3   so  a 4 it is!!   )
i think i've found the best soup dumplings in flushing   the pork and crab meat is one of the best i've had in a long time there's also a smattering of other dishes that i'm a fan of  cucumbers in garlic  spicy beef tendon  shanghai stir fried u don   the fried buns i would not order again 
nan xiang is my "go to" place when i stay at the asiatic hotel around the corner and go to the u s  open  helen runs the place like a master conductor  she's a dear  don't miss their awesome crab pork dumplings  amazing!
for a dumpling house with michelin guide reviews  i expected more  more for my money  more for my tastebuds and just more in general  the scallion pancakes were great  but the soup dumplings at congee village in manhattan far surpass the ones here and i think they are cheaper too  the fact that this place is nestled in between so many restaurants and yet  it still has survived is perhaps a testament to the power of yelp and food guides to send people "off the beaten path" but to the same sub par location  that's why i ended up here and i probably won't do it again  this is not to say that this was the worst food ever  because it was totally sufficient  but i did expect more than sufficient 
i'm not used to authentic chinese but when you have here you're getting an experience  having never heard of the place but being open minded  i went to this place and i'm glad i did  the soup dumplings of crab meat and pork are amazing  especially when the liquid bursts creating the flavor and taste of the meat  i also had the tofu appetizer  which was enhanced by the red pepper seasoning  for the main course  i had the beef with crispy noodles and mushrooms i don't remember what it was called all in all  everything was good and out of the authentic chinese places i've been to  this was by far the best in terms of quality of food 
i showed up at 3pm for a late lunch early dinner to beat the weekend crowds  seated in 10 minutes? not bad    we ordered a ton of stuff  my favorites were   soup dumplings (the original one  not the crab meat)  cucumber garlic salad (this was really tasty and probably easy to replicate at home) and the scallion pancake with beef (really good but super fatty greasy) the crab soup dumplings  vegetarian chicken  fried dumplings  stir fry udon noodles were all just   ok    they weren't particularly good or bad the bad part of our visit was when the bus boy came over to pour us tea we and noticed one of the cups was dirty    we asked for another one  the bus boy seemed pretty pissed off about it    he brought another cup and then slammed it on the table to show us it was clean    it was much uncalled for    other members of the wait staff were very nice and friendly    just that one guy was a real jerk i also noticed that on the window of the restaurant there is a b rating and on the menu they show an a  2 stars because of the jerky bus boy
this is the new spot for xlb's i've been here a few times now and they aren't playing games at all  both the pork and the crab pork combo xlb's are amazing  they are better than joe's shanghai in manhattan  i love joe's shanghai  but i think this place does it better  the menu is much more contained than joe's so really i'm just coming here for the dumplings  i really like seeing the ladies assembling the dumplings by hand just like in the best places in shanghai  definitely adds to the experience they also have xjb's  which are good  but the one time i had them here they had no broth inside and were a bit doughy  the flavor was still good and i would bet that it's hit or miss from visit to visit on the xjb front  i've heard the soups are great and can't imagine that they wouldn't be given the quality of the soup dumplings some people are complaining about the wait  but the easy solution is to just go early  make sure you bring cash  i've had to spot my friends (pay for them) the last few times because they don't take card 
probably my favorite place to get xlb  the place is pretty big and service is fast  the dumplings imo are huge and loaded with juice! i hear that this place gets real busy  but everytime i've come  i've come during off peak hours and never had to wait longer than 5 minutes  the other items are the menu were ok  but i just come here and order the dumplings 
best soup dumplings in town  their menu in not huge but what they do  they do very well 
all you need to know is get the pork soup dumplings and scallion pancakes
sometimes they have the sweet potato fries  sometimes they don't   confusing!!!  great soup dumplings   appetizers are good as well 
good cheap eats   the two of us ate till we were stuffed for about $28 total   scallion pancake stuffed with beef   $2 75pork soup dumplings   $5 50pork and crab soup dumplings   $6 50rice cakes with pork  shrimp and fish   $9 95this was the first time i've been here   be prepared to sit super close to others   they try to maximize the small seating area   the menu is limited also  but their their thing is the soup dumplings i love soup dumplings   they're delicious and so much fun to eat!  i couldn't taste a difference between the crab and pork vs  just the pork dumplings so i don't think it's worth the extra buck for the crab version i was pleasantly surprised by the scallion pancake with beef in the middle along with hoisen sauce (i think) and it was yummy!the rice cakes were good  a little oily   i don't think it was worth getting the seafood version (vs  just beef or pork or chicken) for $3 extra   there wasn't enough fish or shrimp at all!  again  not the best i ever had  but def good cheap eats!  i'd go back again  )heads up   it's hard to park in flushing  but there's a municipal parking lot across the street if you're lucky enough to get spot   10 min for $0 25 is a rip off  but that's ny for ya 
i love this place  so so so much the soup dumplings are perfect and i could eat them all day  also excellent are the scallion pancakes with beef  and the shanghai pan fried udon  and the tripe (cold)  pretty much everything here is amazing every time i go here i walk out so pleased with my life choices and everyone i take also falls in love  i will be back here as often as possible
you would think that going on a sunday would be a horrible experience but i was surprised it turned out okay  parking around the area was not too bad as you can find parking here and there  mind you i went on easter sunday and when asians go to pay respects to family members who passed away  my wait for a table for two was quick about 5 minutes but the wait for the xiaolongbao was longer  they seemed to have forgot our order of the two different dumplings so we just dropped the crabmeat with pork dumpling  as we observed the area  there were a lot of vacant tables so i wondered why it took long for service  the waitress probably forgot the order because others who were seated before got the dumplings before us  but when the dumplings arrived i was a little disappointed  they were placed in the usual bamboo trays but they did not place the dumplings under lettuce but under the typical plastic wrap  the flavor of the pork was there and the soup inside was abundant but the taste compared to joe shanghai was different  i preferred their competitors  but i think i should give this another try 
they were solid soup dumplings  but considering the rave reviews  i had expected them to be much much better  i feel like i've had these quality dumplings at much less raved about places in the bay area  but perhaps it is not fair to judge nyc chinese food on bay area standards 
place order 30min and the server came over and asked "what did you order?"     bad service  order just went out the air!
came here on 9 6 after seeing a long line outside while looking for a place to eat  i was trying to see why there's a line for this restaurant  boy was i in for a disappointment waited 15 minutes to outside till i got in to eat  what i noticed is how some tables were empty and people were waiting outside  it was like they purposely were trying to create a wait once we were in  we ordered  steamed soup dumplings  shanghainese pan fried udon  and hunan dumplings with peanut butter sauce  we tried to order some of the cold specialties (like drunken chicken)  but all the stuff were supposedly "sold out"  we waited quite a bit for our food  another couple came in about 10 minutes after we came in and got their food at exactly the same time  was extremely angry  our steamed soup dumplings were warm (not steaming hot like it just came out) and highly mediocre  shanghainese pan fried udon was literally one just the noodles (one leaf of veggie  and maybe a fingernail of meat)  after we ate these two dishes  we were quite disappointed and began waiting for the easiest item of them all  the hunan dumplings with peanut butter  we asked them about it and they said it is coming real soon (it did not arrive until another 10 minutes   obviously they forgot the order and just told the kitchen to make it)  we thought it was going to come "real soon" so we tried to ask again  what happens? the waiter ignores us and we were just left there like idiots  when the dumpling arrived  it was probably the worst hunan dumplings i've tasted  the dumpling skin was overly thick  and dumplings were covered with peanut butter (lacked the red oil)  being overly covered with peanut butter made it probably the driest junk i've ever tasted  tip to others  don't order this from this restaurant  i would rather go to new world to get some that tastes better overall  highly disappointed  would not come again 
hands down the best soup dumplings in nyc!!! i took one star off because of the staffs  otherwise this is the place guys!!
food inspection  rate "a"  also restaurant guide rating  michelin rating! the place is tight  small tables  long long line outside  they do rotate the patrons rather quickly  not because of any of the staff rushing you out of the place but rather it is not a elaborate meal   the place is simple to the point and tasty   back to how small tight the place is  i ended up bumping my hand on the hot dish and pushing my green tea up in the air!!!! poor girl next to me ended up wearing some of the green tea   glad it was cold  ( totally my fault and well wish the restaurant would use bigger tables  now moving on to the food  after the tea was cleaned up it was down to business! we ordered dumplings and soups  plentiful portions and the order just kept on coming  eat slowww! maybe have a little snack before hand? just saying we ordered a lot and glad we were able to take some leftovers! overall parking is tricky  make sure to check out the parking garage in the corner  i paid $5 for less than 3 hours    there may be a line but it moves quick and you are served rather quickly 
stayed in flushing for work for a week  so i couldn't pass up getting chinese food   especially since i never get it in wi  that being said  i am no expert on soup dumplings  so if you're looking for the absolute best  i can't say if this is or not  but it's the best i've had we got soup dumplings  pan fried dumplings and rice cakes with beef (i will not even attempt what any of that is called in chinese)  soup dumplings were so big   i was expecting much smaller  but they were sooo good  everything else was really good too  i would definitely go back if i'm in town environment  very casual  very crowded  cash only  at least the menu is in english too   as i would not be able to order otherwise service  not friendly service (not rude either)  but pretty quick and i didn't need anything extra  totally felt judged for ordering in english though 
on to what many consider to be the best place to get soup dumplings in nyc  nan xiang  i am not a connoisseur of soup dumplings per say  but i am well versed in dumplings in general  i've never had a soup dumpling that made me go bonkers  however  the crab and pork soup dumplings at nan xiang more than surprised me for $6 50 you get six tennis ball sized buns  steamed and smelling quite savory  taking a bite into one is an interesting experience  first there is a thin  tender wonton wrapper; then the broth floods into your mouth and gives you an immersed feeling of warmth; finally your teeth sink into the combination of pork fat and crab meat that has perfect balances of salt  broth and meat we also had a noodle dish that was pretty good  but nothing as exciting as the soup buns  i honestly think that ordering nothing but the soup dumplings and the standard pork buns would be totally fine  get the best at the best place i say  more or less  everything on the menu is around $5  the place can get pretty crowded  but they seem to seat people very quickly nan xiang is only a couple blocks up from white bear on prince st  so you have a convenient dumpling path  you'd be a fool not to take up both places if you're in the area 
they got them boom boom baosjoe shanghai jockin' their stylesix to a steamer  that's swaggerorder some soup noodles nowexpanded since 2008now there's less of a waitbut still rockin' boom boom baosreigning champs of xiao long baoslet me get some now
really good dumpling and soups  every time i gotten noodles they have way to much oil in them  friendly staff  service take little longer and there is usually a long line to be seated  the food really cheap there for it make it on my favorite  local places 
those scallion pancakes with beef  wow  i wouldn't leave this place without trying them  great soup dumplings too  worth making a trip to flushing  plus it costs barely nothing  service is prompt and efficient  restaurant is located on a sidestreet and the writing on the front is in chinese so i stood in front for almost 2 minutes trying to figure out if i was at the right place  decor inside is simple  best tables seem to be by the window  will be coming back for sure 
i had the pork and shrimp dumplings  and the scallion pancake with beef   both were good  but not as flavorful as i was hoping for 
the soup dumplings are so delicious! especially for the price  the staff members were really friendly too 
these are the most authentic tasting soup dumplings spot in flushing (that i know of)  no! joe shanghai is not better  not in a long time! this spot is decent priced and the food is great! they have all the major types (crab  pork  etc ) of soup dumplings  but have a lot of other things  shanghainese cuisine is known for their "cold" dishes and there is a large variety they offer  all super tasty! their restaurant is very wide so there are a lot of seats  even at their busiest you wont be waiting longer than 10 15 (rarely) 20 minutes max  servers are always on point  super respectful and speak many different dialects of chinese; and yes they do speak english! this place is great for a group of people  that is  if you like to share food  which you should  cause its awesome and thats how chinese people like to eat  must come here for breakfast  sweet soy milk with fried sticks? (idk how to refer to those in english) so good  writing this review has made me hungry  im going to pay them a visit soon  1 star off because they only accept cash  idk how many times i had to run to the bank!
this place is always crowded every time i go there  make sure you get a number for seating  they fairly recently expanded their restaurant next door to accommodate the excess of  customers  they make one of the best soup dumplings that i have ever tasted  when i am there i usually get two orders of the soup dumplings  i don't order the ones with crab because there is barely any  crabs in it  the shanghai udon is really good too with a slight pepper taste with meat it taste great  lastly i usually order a side of scallion pancake  it is flaky and doughy in the middle just the way i like it  the wait service is always good but they won't talk to you since they are always running around like  word of advice  order the soup dumplings once you get seated since it takes some time for them to be cooked 
the most delicious scallion pancakes that you'll ever have   the sliced beef complimented by the sauce is literally to die for!!!!
whoa whoa  how surprising   for the first time  i didn't have to wait 30 min for a table!  but then again  they've expanded and took over the restaurant next door   this place literally makes the best soup dumplings   ever!  i know a lot of you people vouch for joe's shanghai or whatever  but this place has perfected soup dumpling   it's never a disappointment with the dumplings   always filled with soup and never dried out   two ways to eat it   most people just put the dumpling on the soup spoon and drink the soup first and eat the dumpling (which is fine   i guess)   me?  i put the whole thing in my mouth  and just let the soup explode while i chew!  yes  even when it's scalding hot!  (caution  those with small mouths shouldn't try it) i really don't eat anything else there   except the chicken soup   not yo mama's campbell's chicken soup!  chicken soup chinese style!  it's herbal and has a slight bitter taste to it but it warms you up in an instant 
overrated   i know this place is michelin recommended  but i think it is not much better than joe's shanghai   the broth is meh  and the skins came broken on several of the dumplings   the much praised scallion pancakes had little scallion or taste; you can get much better versions for $1 from the street vendors on main st   as for the restroom  i wish i had not stopped in to wash my hands prior to tje meal   it was just dirty enough to drain one's appetite 
these dumplings are awesome!!! every time i come here i always get the pork and crab steamed dumplings  they are out of this world  heaven on earth! what more can i say? i have also had the scallion pancake a few times  it is ok a little greasy or oily  but tasty  fried food tastes good  i had the seaweed salad last time and i didn't really care for it  i prefer seaweed salad in the japanese restaurant cause they use different seaweed and different dressing  the place is always busy and the service can be slow if you are not pushy like me  there is a parking lot right across the street  i highly recommend this place!
soup dumplings!!!!!!  i'm a sucker for some soup dumplings   and this place set the bar!we ordered pork crabmeat soup dumplings  green onion pie w  beef  pan fried pork bao  and some stir fried rice cakes w  pork this is going to be a place i come to every trip to ny 
perhaps joe's shanghai's greatest rival  the xiao long bao soup dumplings are one of the best in the city and you even get to see it get made! place gets packed even early on sunday morning as they also serve breakfast their dumpling skin is slightly more tender than joe's shanghai  but the pork and juice a little less tastier  still a great delight  after you poke a hole on top of the dumpling  suck out all the juice(or leave some behind) then put a tad of vingear into the hole  and for good measure add a piece of ginger on top  then just gulp it in  heaven  if you are into crab  you can also have the crab pork mix dumpling  like i mentioned  their 'meat' is a little less tastier  perhaps a tad more 'filling' was added to dilute save cost  but just a tad  remember when you order multiple batches of dumplings keep them on top of each other  if you let cold air in   it will stick and you will miss the juicy fun  their homemade soy bean milk was great  a must mix when eating your xiao long bao  had the appetizer of sticky rice with a piece of fried dough cruller dry shredded pork embedded inside was not bad  very plain but very fulling  it's probably best to come when it's not as crazy like a weekday  because you will probably get a fresher batch of dumplings  it gets hectic  and the customer service decreases a bit  overall  a great experience and perhaps the best xiao long bao in flushing 
the dumplings and noodles  cold dishes are the best!
tried the xiao long bao  not as good as i expected  and definitely not very authentic 
the famous shanghai soup dumplings are a must have  and arguably the best in the city   the shanghainese cold dishes are pretty good too  i particularly like the kaufu   all other foods are good but down to the typical level   expect long wait times because this is a popular spot and relatively small dine in area   seating also feels cramped bottom line  even the restaurant knows that people come specifically for the soup dumplings   when they prepare the tables  they already put vinegar dishes on them 
i've been at this restaurant several times and after each time i dislike it more than the last  i got food poisoned the last time i was here  the service has alwaysss been bad here which isn't anything surprising  they always forget to put your order in and then make you wait forever without an apology (happened 2 out 2 times this past month)  the soup dumpling has gone down the hill too  i don't think i'll ever come back after getting food poisoned  sticking to joe's shanghai 
emperor ferdinand i once said  "i am the emperor  and i want dumplings "i understood what he meant as i stood in line at the very popular nan xiang soup dumpling house in flushing  new york this michelin guide recommended restaurant serves up piping hot bamboo baskets of signature xiao long bao ($5 50)  pillow soft dumplings filled with meat in aspic  which melts into broth as the dumplings are steamed nanxiang is a suburb of shanghai  china  where they were invented  and is still known for having the best xiao long bao anywhere in the very small open kitchen  three women stand around the counter like the fates  measuring out the delectable soup mixture and folding it into freshly made dumpling skins   in fact  you'll notice that there are only women in the kitchen  head chef huang jian ping will tell you that women are simply better at folding dumplings carefully peel a hot dumpling off the bed of cabbage without puncturing it  and dip it into a sauce of shredded ginger in seasoned black vinegar   some like to take a nibble off the top  and some like to bite off the side   whichever method you prefer  you'll be hit with the intense flavors of velvety minced crab  pork  and flavorful broth in a soft skin 
i dont see what the big fuss is about  the pork buns are not good they were soggy and had way too much msg  i will not be back 
i biked out here from brooklyn today and it was well worth the trek  the place was buzzing with people so we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table  once seated they brought us hot tea  lovely on brisk fall day   ordered the pork soup dumplings (which take the longest to make so they arrived last)  the shanghai veggie udon  beef and pepper noodle soup  and seaweed garlic side  the dumplings come six to an order and you eat them with this amazing dark vinegar fresh ginger condiment   all the dishes were fresh  full of flavor  and filling  the portions are large  two entrees easily serve four  to top it all off  our bill was under $30   this place is a winner and i will totally be back 
best soup dumplings in town  been coming here since they opened with one store front and now expanded to three stores  i would recommend everyone to try the crab meat soup dumplings  scallion noodles and scallion pancake (all 3 i always get every time i go plus more) 
heard this place by coworker  xiao long bao didn't tasted as what i expected  but still taste better than many places
very good  but honestly hard to believe that they have been michelin recommended for so many years  first off  after a short wait we were seated but then blatantly ignored by all the servers  i swear it was because we aren't asian  they actually looked the other way when we made eye contact & tried to wave them over  after finally grabbing (literally) a waiter we ordered soup dumplings (good but not the best we've had) & scallion pancake stuffed with beef (awesome!)  then came shredded chicken with rice cake (excellent) & shanghai udon (good)   overall the food was tasty  no atmosphere & if you are white   the service sucks  make sure you go with some asian friends & i'm sure you'll have a decent time   btw   super cheap!!! $25 for all four items 
the soup dumplings here are very good  they're not my favorite in the city but they are good   noodle soups are also very good   the service is inconsistent though   i've been here and was served immediately  however  i've also been here and had to wait almost 10 minutes 
no frills place to get soup dumplings and some "brunch" aka salty soybean milk  my absolute fave luckily  i always manage to grab seats within the first 2 3 minutes  (besides that one time in the rain where we patiently braved the elements for a solid 10)i usually get the crab dumplings  salty soybean milk  my boyfriend opts for the pan fried noodles (they serve beef  chicken  pork  and seafood i think)service is either hit or miss  but being chinese myself  i don't expect much service when i'm eating at places like these 
great soup dumplings  i like joe's shanghai better but these were a really tasty option   i loved them  a great ratio of filling to skin   the real star here was the scallion pancake with beef   really amazing  fast service for lunch  this place is packed at lunch and is on everyone' s radar in flushing 
although it doesn't compare to din tai fung  this is probably the best xlb place in nyc   they have expanded in the last few years  but it can still get pretty packed around dinner time and the weekends   they have a limited menu  but what they do serve is mostly very good and affordable  especially their xlb  cold dishes and breakfast items 
i've been coming to this place for years now  i remember when it was a hole in the wall type of place and now it has two more rooms to the restaurant! no more waiting for a table to get my yummy soup dumplings! i love this place because it's cheap and its good! everything on the menu is delicious! if you are looking for something authentic to eat i would suggest trying the warm sweet soy milk with crispy dough and just rip pieces of the crispy dough and put it in your warm soy milk  reminds me of a simple breakfast when i traveled to china!
of the two heavyweight soup dumpling joints in flushing  nan xiang comes out the winner in my book   the soup dumplings are filling and don't have an excessive amount of soup in them so they're not too difficult to handle   one set along with an appetizer is enough to keep me filled and happy   for the appetizer  i would recommend that seaweed and chili salad   it may sound intimidating to some but it's a surprisingly refreshing dish   i didn't get to try any other dishes during my visit but they seem to have a solid menu only gripe is the seating area and the waiting time   since nan xiang is insanely popular among locals and wayward tourists in flushing  the wait times can get excessive   the waiting area is miniscule  since nearly every part of the restaurant is utilized to service the maximum amount of people   some tend to crowd around the door  leading to problems getting in and out of the restaurant   others choose to wait outside but there's a chance of missing your number being called   it'd be nice if they either had the ability to announce numbers outside or at least ring up people when their table is ready   also be ready to share a table with others since they like serving as many people as possible 
i would give this place 6 starts if allowed!if you are ever craving some absolutely delicious shanghai food on a snowy thursday  then this is the place to go! actually  it doesn't matter when you go  because nan xiang is just plain awesome! as per the recommendations of many of my fellow yelpers  i first ordered the xiao long bao (soup dumplings)  followed by the scallion pancake with sliced beef  for the third dish  i ordered the spicy beef with noodle soup   allow me explain further  my culinary voyage  the soup dumplings were steamed to perfection  the skin  was slightly chewy  with mild flavor  contained inside is a delicious  briny broth  and a tender piece of steamed pork  (a++)  next was the scallion pancake with sliced beef  i am actually still having dreams about this dish  the beef is slightly sweet and very tender  and is contained in a decent sized scallion pancake that is light  fluffy and fried to perfection and is a good idea to split with someone else  as for the beef with noodle soup  the broth was flavorful and not too spicy  with plenty of noodles and beef and peppers  a great addition to the meal on a very cold and snowy day i will be returning to nan xiang soon  and often 
yelp reviews directed me here for some of the mind blowing soup dumplings ever tasted in nyc  let me check my mind  nope  not blown  i was surprised that the crab and pork wasn't that tasty  it definitely passed the test but it wasn't something i would recommend to people that they must have! however  the pork soup dumplings on the other hand was definitely a must have! it trumped the crab and pork by far being a much more flavorful doughy pouch of goodness the appetizers were average  didn't really care for the seaweed  the  "couple's meat platter" was alright  i would comment that the scallion pancakes were awful  they were like slabs of soft poorly pan fried pancakes slapped together  gross  whatever happened to the crisp exteriors that a real scallion pancake should have? when holding nan xiang's scallion pancake up with my chopsticks it flops over like a sad child hunched over in class waiting for school to end  what an upsetting pancake   
the soup dumplings were little delicate pillows of pure pleasure   my boyfriend and i had the crab and pork soup dumplings   the skin was delicate and thin  filling was perfectly seasoned and yielded a nice amount of soup   there was a long line for this place to get in  but we only waited five or ten minutes   their soup dumplings are hot and everyone wants a piece of it!
the xlb are qdd (quite damn delicious) but i don't know  they're not the best i've had   they are on the sweetish side  have an extremely delicate flavor  and are oh so pretty   my favorite xlb in the tristate are still from petite soo chow (yelp com biz petite soo …) so why the four stars?  scallion oil noodles (cong you mian)   they are cracktacular and rdd (ridiculously damn delicious) i came here around 5pm on a sunday and didn't have to wait  but it was really busy and got pretty crowded pretty fast 
this is a decent place for a quick bite  the noodle soup are pretty good  the house dumbling taste so good  i think i'm going to visit more often
this is the most authentic dumpling place i've been too  the prices were good  it was about 6 50 for each dumpling dish  we  had the crab and pork xiao long bao and the soup tasted delicious  it was very clean and flavorful tasting  the crab made the soup inside slightly sweeter which i liked  the skins of the bun was just the right thickness to hold the soup without ripping when you pulled it up and tasted delicious  we also got the pork pan fried dumpling which was very good  it was like biting into a pillow with delicious pork filling  although  they did made and mistake and forgot one of our dishes  since we were tourist  we didn't have time to wait another 25 minutes for the beef and scallion pancakes ( you know its fresh when it takes that long)   but all in all  i was very with our visit and will definitely come back again when in new york!!!
wow  if you like great tasting dim sum at good prices and nice service  then come and check this out  more than worth the effort 
solid food  but not spectacular  reasonably prompt and friendly service  comfortable and functional dining area  decent value for money 
four stars for the xiao long bao because this place is so much better than joe's shanghai a lot less grease the beef in the scallion pancakes were good too  i came here several times just for the soup dumplings but on one occasion we ordered jellyfish and also the cucumber appetizer and also a rice cakes with beef the two appetizers were bland and did not taste very fresh and also the rice cakes were way too salty i have also had some of the other hot appetizers which were better but the dumplings are what save this place  but this is definitely not the place to be adventurous unless if you want a heart attack from the spike in blood pressure you will get from everything else
i first discovered the soup dumpling almost 10 years ago at joe's   i then was weaned at shanghai cafe  and then finally reached soup dumpling nirvana at din tai fung in taiwan   yet throughout this past decade  i can count the number of places where i've eaten them on one hand   if i was really to become a soup dumpling aficionado  i'd have to try some other places  and the most highly recommended suggestion was nan xiang in flushing the trek out to flushing is long but generally the food has always been worth it  and nan xiang was no different except in the decor   this was an actual restaurant that was clean and bright with room for at least 50 people   of course though  decor was only a mere sidenote compared to the reason for this trip  the soup dumplingwhile din tai fung will still always hold a place as my favorite  nan xiang's soup dumpling was excellent   at first i was little shocked that they were served only 6 to an order at almost $7 for the pork version (in comparison  shanghai cafe and joe's in manhattan chinatown serves 8 for less than $5)   i thought maybe the mark up was due to the friendlier  roomier confines within which i was sitting   but upon my first puncture  slurp  and bite  i realized that this was a special soup dumpling   first  the skin of the dumpling was not too thick and yet not completely transparent that it would break when trying to pick it up   definitely a lot of points on the skin   second  the pork filling tasted fresh and delicious in combination with the skin   there was no greasy feeling after   finally and most impressively  there was a lot of soup in those dumplings  moreso than in any i'd ever eaten   whereas shanghai cafe or joe's might have 1 2 seconds worth of slurping (and mouthroof burning)  nan xiang's had at least 3 4 seconds worth of warm  comforting pork flavored broth in its dumplings   the miracle of all this soup may have helped explained the slight markup on its soup dumpling prices   as my friends and i were in the middle of a dumpling crawl  we didn't get a chance to try their wide array of noodle soups and entrees   but they tempted us whenever they passed by   the noodle soup bowls were huge and had all kinds of fillings in them   i also noticed a large number of tables ordering appetizers like shredded bean curd   one dish we did get was the scallion pancake with beef wrapped within   wow  it was and is definitely a must eat   the crispyness of the pancake with the sweet and savory of the beef brisket made me want to call up all bbq joints to have scallion pancakes added to their side dish menus there will be days in the future where an order of shanghai cafe's dumplings will be simply all i need   however that day in the future may take a long time to happen 
incredible dumplings and tasteful niu rou mien! the only problem is that the place is very small and the wait for the dumplings can take a while but when the taste is exquisite  the wait is worthwhile!
awesome  ) if you can't find din tai fung around you  they are not the best dumplings i've had in my life but they come pretty close  what i do like about this place is that they have chinese style breakfast  which i miss  to be more specific this very shanghainese  the salty beancurd mmmm  fried dough fritters they make it them really well here  it come out hot and crispy but fluffy inside    awesome !!!!the noodles are really good  one of the better la mein type noodle   i've had  so if you haven't tried this place  ) try it ! plus it's cheap  )
this place has the best soup dumplings i've ever had in my xx years of age! the dumplings come out fresh and hot and super tasty! the kitchen is an open space and is close to the seating area so you can actually watch the cooks roll the dough  stuff the dumplings  and put them in a steamer   everying comes out so fresh! the soup that comes out of the dumplings is so flavorful  really hit the spot on a cold day!
yummy!    and they were great and accommodating with our stroller even though place was packed    soup dumplings were great   cucumber appetizer delicious and i loved the steamed veggie dumplings!
awesome soup dumplings and noodle dishes!!! they also have wonderful cold appetizer dishes that are tasty  fresh and complementary to the heavy dumplings noodles (spicy bamboo shoots  cucumber in garlic and oil  etc)  on weekends  expect a line but the turnaround is fast  love this place! the only dish that isn't as good as joe's shanghai is the scallion pancakes  they're just ok 
came to this place this morning for some breakfast   shao bing (sesame flatbread) & you tiao (fried bread stick) but was informed that there was no shao bing available   it is 10am   why wouldn't you have breakfast?! instead  i ordered a bowl of sweet soymilk with "jiu cai he" (garlic chives turnovers) and my mom ordered some dumplings   we waited for 45 minutes for our food to come  only to find out that it tasted awful   we didn't order xiao long bao  but perhaps this place is only worth that   the service is super slow and our server was rude to the max   she had all kinds of excuses for why the food takes 45 minutes to come  and mouthed off to my mother when she inquired why our food was taking so long when we ordered so little   talking down to my mother?  minus 1000   i'm not sure how numerous customers have overlooked the service of this place and tolerated it for so long   perhaps this place is worth the try at least once  but i won't be coming back for more!
you eat here now!  i've been going to this place for years   best soup dumplings ever   it's a madhouse and you can wait for quite a while for your order  sometimes they can be a bit rude  but i still give it 5 stars because it's so delish!try the steamed pork buns (soup dumplings)   the soy peas  bean curd  and cabbage salad is just amazing!  the cucumber w  garlic is great too   really everything    except for the soups (nothing special) if you want the best soup dumplings in the city  eat here!
firstly they sat us by the door and it's freezing cold when there's more than enough tables further in  people who came in after us were all seated inside  when i tried to order certain things on the menu they said they didn't have it  they just opened an hour ago i don't think they ran out so if they're not serving it anymore take it off the menu  she didn't elaborate on why it wasn't available  ordered 5 items and only received 4 dishes  once again no explanation  no status update like we're in the process of cooking it ? probably just forgot  we couldn't even ask where the last plate was or ask for the check because they didn't care to check in on how we were doing  after awkwardly sitting there for 25 minutes just went to the cashier and asked her for the check  i don't mind waiting for a dish that takes longer to cook but i would like to be informed  she just forgot didn't give a shit  horrendous service  very rude  needs better staff management  the cashier was busy texting and she realized when it was too late we were neglected and pissed 
awesome xlb!  its the best i've ever had and my wife says its the best she's ever had outside of asia   the cucumber garlic dish and the rice cake with beef are a must also! its a nice clean restaurant with good prompt service   and the prices are really affordable! the only sadness was that they ran out of the spicy bamboo   next time!
i always heard new york had good chinese food  so it really confused me when  after two years here  i hadn't found a single place that impressed me   then i learned about main street in flushing  and a quick search on yelp led me to nan xiang dumpling house   forget chinatown  this is where it's at   i've been back several times and have never left disappointed   so many reviews mention the soup dumplings  so naturally it was the first thing i tried   i felt like a outsider as i naively bit into it  not realizing the obvious  that the soup would spill all over the table and my face   it did   after observing the more experienced soup dumpling eaters  i quickly caught on to their method   gently placing the dumpling on a spoon and opening a tiny hole with surgical precision in order to extract the mind blowingly flavorful liquid that lures patrons into this always packed house   wow  i've never tasted anything like this  now i understand why i had to take a number to be seated   besides the soup dumplings  i'm all about the pork and cabbage soup  packed with noodles and greens  it's about as tasty as a soup can get   the cucumber and garlic salad and the scallion pancakes with beef are also solid  they have seriously special hoisin sauce   the stir fried udon noodles were underwhelming at best  they weren't as flavorful as the other dishes and were somewhat greasy   the service is also hit or miss  but that's just part of the fun 
it is legit but it is not as good as the dumpling places in la and sf i love 
solid place for xiao long bao  better than joe's (both locations) but not as good as shanghai cafe in chinatown  we ordered the pork xiao long bao  scallion pancake with beef and the parsnip puffs (recommended by the waiter after he commented that we didn't order enough)  the xiao long bao were good with savory soup and thin skin but like a previous reviewer mentioned something seemed to be missing   not sure what  maybe i wasn't that hungry or it wasn't cold enough outside   the parsnip puffs were a tasty treat but the highlight  of our meal was  the scallion pancake with beef  order it now!!!!the service was good and even though there were many families and couples present  we didn't have to wait long for dinner on a wednesday evening  i am willing to come back and give the soup dumplings another try   oh yea   just so you know the place only accepts cash   no cards 
i love this place  it's probably the best place in the entire new york area to get xiao long bao (soup dumplings)  the skins are thin  thin  thin  and the soup has a really good flavor; it's full and meaty  unlike some other places i've been to where the "soup" on the inside of the bao is more like oil  not here! the shanghainese stir fried rice cake here is pretty good  well fried on the wok  prices here are decent  too  definitely be prepared to wait a bit if you want to eat here  or try coming at off peak hours  i had dinner here one night  but i'm dying to come back to try their breakfast    i love youtiao and soy milk!
1 take out order of 1 serving of soup dumplings (6 dumplings total) took 30 minutes   a littttle ridiculous   $5 50   not that much cheaper than midtown joe's shanghai   i also ordered a scallion pancake  which they forgot  but i was too fed up at that point to wait for it dumplings   they were ok   chewy skin and lots of soup   not as greasy as joe's   but they also did not blow my mind 
simply the best dumplings i have ever experienced and also deliciously crunchy and chewy scallion pancakes 
the skin of the dumplings is transparent thin  however  service is poor  our server stood over us because we ordered 2 appetizer and 1 noodle  the server rudely replied "is that all?"  putting the standing pressure over us to order more food afterall  the price of the bill is $25 with 1 steam bun  2 appetizers and 1 noodle dish 
go here for   beef scallion pancake  so so yummy  i may have liked it even more than the xiao long bao themselves  the sauce they put on it is amazing   xiao long bao  tasty  soupy goodness  plus you can watch them make them  so you know it's fresh  a bit big though  so get creative on different eating methods!  ridiculously cheap prices  $60ish to fill five starving bellies to the brim maybe go here for   beef noodle soup  i've had better   places where you can see the noodles being whacked and whipped into shape  hit the spot on a chilly day though   the side dishes  the braised soy beans were delicious   but i can't speak to the others  also  the fact that they have them sitting out where everyone is waiting makes me slightly question how many germs they're covered in  whatever  they were tasty don't go here for   regular scallion pancake  sorry  vegetarians  i like plants as much as the next gal  but this is just unfair compared to the beef pancake    quick service  it's a busy place  just wait your turn  and if they forget that it's your turn  let them know before they seat the next party in your spot ;)
the soup dumplings are it     pork or the crab and pork dumplings are really good   the restaurant did earn a michelin star for their dumplings   an order does take a little while to make  so you will wait  they start making your dumplings after you order them   order an appetizer with your dumplings if you are hungry one of my most embarrassing food moments took place here as an older chinese woman  felt compelled to give me a lesson in eating the soup dumplings correctly  i was not representing               other yelpers explain how to eat them properly i think this a must stop on the prince st  flushing cheap eats tour  which i think would also include sifu chio  happy beef noodle house  sunway  spicy and tasty and white bear with a quick detour to xi'an famous foods 
best breakfastxlbplain hot soy milkscallion pancakecold spicy braised beef with tripe 
the best soup dumplings in ny  skip joe shanghai's and head over to nan xiang! you won't regret it!
these people aren't messing round  they're quick and efficient  and the soup dumplings are some of the best i've had  the boyfriend and i tried the pork and the pork crab  the crab had more flavor  we also had the crispy noodles with beef  so good! also  a must try is the bamboo shoots in chili oil  its a cold appetizer  but is delicious 
above average xlbs  but you can sure do a whole lot worse in the flushing area  the variety at this place will keep me coming back  they have awesome pork and cabbage noodles (awesome for cold  wintery day) in a very hearty broth  also  just recently tried the wontons with chili oil and peanut butter  and it was a savory  unusual combo  i have also tried the scallion pancakes with the beef and the tofu gluten dish served cold     both also come highly recommended come early on weekends and expect a wait  the yelp followers and bus tours departing from the yuppie cesspools are all on board!
service was just basic  but  the main reason you go to this place is good food  highlight dishes were crab pork dumplings and beef chilly pepper noodle soup (very mildly spicy)  this is a cash only joint 
ok     so the last time i had nan xiang was actually in china shanghai in yu yuan    the line was super long there     but i dig!i have been really good today    12hours of studying   so i decided to treat myself to some xlb! asked my friends if they wanted to come with me    and it was the best decision ever!not sure if its related to the same establishment from shanghai  but   the xlb was good   i definitely liked the crab xlb more than the pork  the skin was almost perfect  and there were so much soup inside   yumm!!! we also ordered jian bao   not sure what the english name is   xd  but it was pretty good as well    the skin wasnt too thick and still moist  =dthe service was subpar   but who cares when the xlb is good  =) i would definitely travel all the way to flushing again for some xlb!!!!!!!! =d
sigh  sigh  sigh  nan shian xiao long bao   how many times am i going to come back to you  only to be disappointed by you again? i've brought two friends here separately  promising them the best xiao long bao in the business (better than joe's shanghai)  only to be burned by the lack of craftsmanship and flavor they brought out i'm going to dedicated this song to you just gonna stand there and watch me burnbut that's alrightbecause i like the way it hurtsjust gonna stand there and hear me crybut that's alright because i lovethe way you liei love the way you liei love the way you lieyou use to be so amazing   your crab xiao long baos juicy and full of flavor  your beef scallion pancakes fried to the perfect crispness and your service attentive and pristine  this all went down the drain when you decided to take over the empty store next door  now  everything feels commercialized  i feel as if you sold your soul to the suits  now i long for you to return to me   and i always have hope you will   one day food  everything has been different since they decided to "expand " before  this spot was a well known hole in the wall  packed with hungry customers aching for some xiao long bao  now  there is hardly a line or a wait as they doubled their capacity  unfortunately  this has created quality problems  the xiao long bao soup is diluted  there's hardly any flavor  losing any savory feel they had  one time  the beef scallion pancakes seemed undercooked  another time  they took 40 minutes to come out  i need some consistency please  i'm willing to wait if the end product is amazing  but they just aren't anymore noodle dishes are run of the mill  don't expect anything exciting from their fried shanghai thick noodles  rice cakes  or noodles in pork minced sauce  something positive  cold soybean milk is lovely and a good value  they give a lot for the cold dishes in the front (gluten  cucumbers  etc ) ambiance  crowded  you're sitting next to your fellow diners  pretty much standard service  service is absolutely horrible now  i don't expect much going to flushing  but i do expect at least one server to be in the same room i am dining in  instead  my friends and i had to constantly walk over to the other room just to find someone that works here  and no  we weren't badgering the servers with little nuisances  we didn't have spoons for our xiao long bao! how do you expect us to eat?this place is completely understaffed for its newfound capacity  i would suggest more workers table  i feel as if they have the same amount of people as before  but twice the number of tables  one time  my friend wanted some sheng jian bao after eating a rack of xiao longs  my friend ordered them (going into the next room of course); only to be told we had to wait 18 minutes  who says 18 minutes? that's so specific i'm assuming you're using a microwave or foreman grill  we politely declined   but of course the waiter put in the order anyway  gtfo  i'm not waiting for 18 more minutes  i have a meter to tend to!value  standard value in flushing  but they charge tax  big wtf  if you are 'cash only ' no way should you charge tax  this is an unwritten rule in restaurant management! c'mon people  i don't know why my fellow yelpers haven't pointed this out 
sorry  but the place is actually called nan xiang dumpling house  maybe yelp can fix that   don't come here for the service  just for the food  don't get the wine drunk chicken  it doesn't taste drunk  it tasted like it had low tolerance and kicked the bucket early  also  the chicken was anorexic  cause there was no meat on that chicken! do order your xiao long baos (soup dumplings or direct translation   little dragon buns) the second you get seated  then peruse the menu for something to hold you over until your your dumplings get there  i promise you  there will be a wait for them  the shanghai pan fried udon ($6 95) noodles were okay  joe shanghai's is better  they were extremely oily and lacking in the veggies meat area  the noodles tasted a little chalky to me as well the scallion pancakes ($2 95) were smaller than i expected  they also had less scallions than expected  which is a good thing if you hate those green things  the pancake was fried well  and well aerated  good quality taste and went well with the vinegar ginger sauce that is meant for the dumplings  the soup dumplings (6 pieces instead of 8 at joe shanghai's and $5 50 instead of $4 75) were great  the soup was markedly different  it definitely had a cleaner  less fatty taste the ones at joe's  the skin is thinner  which makes it tastes better  but also easier to rip (and the soup to be lost)  the dumplings are better  but joe's is a much smoother operation   dumplings are churned out every second  english is more fluent  and service is not polite  but at least lightning fast  overall  yummy (and cheap)!
fantastic  absolutely fantastic   really enjoyed the xiao long bao  flavorful  soupy  wonderful little balls of goodness   only complaint is that they need to take a bit more time and care with their non chinese patrons so that i can explore more of the menu like a native 
in my opinion this is the best xiao long bao place in flushing the crab and pork soup dumplings are oh so savory  get them!the shredded pork and shiitake mushroom rice cakes are delicious  get them!what?! chives & egg fried bun?! awesome  get it!beef and chili pepper noodle soup or pork and (salted) cabbage noodle soup? get both!sweet soy bean milk for $1? nice tab for all this tasty goodness? roughly $35 conclusion  good for breakfast  great food overall  concise menu  and cheap prices  a must try if you are in the neighborhood 
we lucked out  found a parking space in flushing quite quickly  didn't have to wait in line  arrived just before dinner time  the reviews on yelp kept mentioning the crab and pork soup dumplings  terrific  hot  tasty  we also had the beef and scallion pancakes  yes  a bit greasy but oh so tasty  we thought the best of what we ordered  and  then the pan friend pork buns  yum  these three dishes were plenty to fill us up and we were glad that we hadn't ordered a fourth dish  prices are very affordable  reminder  this is a cash only location 
3 5 starsafter reading some of my peer's review of this restaurant's soup dumplings and how it was the best in nyc  i had to try it out  so after a game of watching baseball at citi field  i decided to come here to try out the xiao long bao's  it did not live up to its billing  i still stand pay that the best xiao long bao's are in cliffside nj at petite soo chow the shanghai noodles left a little to be desired for as it was just too greasy and did not contain much meat or variety for that matter  it still probably has the best soup dumplings in the flushing area though  so i can't knock it 
i always come here for the soup dumplings (xiao long bao) and the assorted chinese breakfast options   scallion pancake and hot soy milk   if you aren't allergic to shellfish  the crabmeat option for the dumplings is pretty tasty   i have a few friends who swear by joe's shanghai  though i don't know why since the quality is really not as great also  nan xiang actually started off as a tiny restaurant (probably less than 10 tables) and then they expanded into the space next door   so for those who complain about the wait time  be thankful that they now have additional seating!  as far as the service goes  it's pretty standard for a chinese restaurant   they get the food out and make sure you get fed   that's all i ever ask for  really   till next time!
i don't even want to review this place because i wouldn't want the line to get longer than it already is! but i'd feel like i was doing the yelp community a disservice by keeping this from you   yes  the soup dumplings are fantastic  and the scallion pancakes a seemingly deep fried and delicious appetizer  but what i really love here  that i have a hard time finding anywhere else  are the vegetable dumplings  perfect chewy skin  and chock full of flavorful greens  i really don't know what goes in it  but it is something amazing  this can convert even the most carnivorous of meat eaters  (ok maybe not  but i can dream )
one slurp  and my sisters' eyes swelled to the size of soup dumplings   i'm flabbergasted we didn't immediately order seconds  oh yeah  i guess because the service was too slow the cold bean curd was worth the $3 75  as were the very popular  crunchy scallion pancakes  [but if you've made it to this review  you know the soup dumplings are what earned nan shian its two consecutive michelin recommendations ]
awesome dumpling and reasonable price  especially the tempting hot beef noodles  totally worth the trip and waiting time 
the food is always great here! known for the soup dumplings and i wouldnt blame them  the soup dumplings were better than joes shanghai  came here for breakfast n dinner  the breakfast was amazing  i love everything on their breakfast menu  nothing that i would complain about  however  when it comes to dinner  somethings were off  dinner was packed like always  had to wait 20mins  the waiters werent that attending  smudges on my utensils  ask for cold ice water n came a flat  luke warm sink water instead ordered a jellyfish appetizers  came more radish than jellyfish n it was extremely oily n salty too  had to gulp down my cup of water  other than that  everything was amazing n well cooked  i just wish the dishes were a lil bigger rather than a palm hand size other then that  whats not to love bout this place 
best soup dumplings in nyc  this is as close to home as it gets for me  they also have stirfry rice cake and a few authentic chinese side dishes that i love!
delicious soup dumplings! we showed up at 3pm and there was a huge crowd of people waiting outside (be prepared to wait)  ordered more food than we could eat and our bill was only $30  so reasonable and delicious 
excellent soup dumplings! we tried their spicy beef and pepper soup and it is delicious  we also tried their shredded pork and rice cake as well as the fried udon noodles  they were both delicious but the dumplings are where it's at this place is great  food wise     their customer service is relatively nonexistent  they never check on you  they forget your drinks  and asking someone for something or ordering more food is taboo  i was definitely ignored on purpose  but the food is so good that i could care less about their terrible servers  as much as the servers take away from the experience  the food is still worth it 
food    they're known for their xiao lung bao that pours out a can of soup when they're puncture   you can also get your filling on taiwanese cuisine here too  staples include scallion dumplings and the cha chiang mein   hot soy bean milk is a great drink for the winter seasons too  decor   a little tight but adequate  europeans might find it a tad cramp  nothing outstanding here about its interior design  value    think chinese food served for chinese people  it's not pf changs   so it's cheap  you're not going to spend more than 20 dollars a person   overall   good food  good value  easily accessible by mass transit  the waiters speaka the engrish too   so my fellow gwai los don't worry  )
hands down  the best xiao long bao (soup dumplings) in nyc   my friend said i'll never want to get xiao long bao from any other establishment in the city after eating here and that is true   when i took my first bite  i noticed how perfectly thin thick the dumpling skin was   it didn't stick to my lip like they sometimes do   the broth inside is very flavorful and clear  untainted by heavy amounts of oil   the turnip puffs  fried bean gluten  and scallion pancake with sliced beef & hoison sauce were some of my other favorite dishes   and the sweet soy bean milk    mmmmmmmmmm   only disappointment was the jellyfish app which had more strips of turnip in it than jellyfish   there is also a guaranteed wait if you go during prime lunch or dinner times  so show up early   i can't wait to go back!
the crab meat steamed buns are a must get!!!!
i started writing this review in november 2009  all i have is  "great xiao lum bao (soup dumplings) as well as other dishes"  that's about all i have to say  i've been there many times and it's always good _____
they soup dumplings here are amazing along with the cold soy milk the spicy wontons with peanut butter sauce  service is okay depending on what day you go 
as a native of flushing  i am really glad this place came into the scene to beat out the monopoly that joe's shanghai had over soup dumplings  i agree with everyone else that their soup dumplings are better  the skin is thinner  the broth tastier and it has more of a contemporary feel with the long tables and open viewing of dumpling making the reason why i really like this place is because of their other dishes  i find the noodle dishes really delicious  especially the beef and chilli pepper noodle  the noodles have a really wonderful chewy texture and the broth is flavored just right  t with thinly sliced beef and right amount of chillies  i am guessing they use the same flour to make their noodles and their dumpling skins  whatever the formula is  it works!this place is really busy but they still treat their customers well and i find their services to be helpful and efficient 
this is a nan shian vs joe's shanghai review  i've been to joe's shanghai three times already in the past month that i've lived in new york and i decided to venture out and try other kinds of xiao long bao  after reading raving reviews and many claims of being "better than joe's" i decided to give nan shian a shot  all in all  i think i'll be sticking with joe's here's my reasons why #1  a lot of people say how they don't like the ridiculous waits at joe's and it's true  i usually have to try to beat the dinner rush line at joe's but at nan shian  i strolled in at 7pm and was seated immediately with a lot of other open tables around me  however  the massive amounts of people at joe's = constant supply of fresh xlb's  usually your order comes within minutes at joe's  but my xlb's at ns came nearly 15 20 minutes after i had ordered  the restaurant wasn't even busy  i am used to ordering my xlb's as i wanted them so i don't have idle xlb's not being eaten and skin toughening up  but it seems at ns you have to order them 15+ minutes in advance  #2  the xiao long bao's themselves  i'm the type of person that likes more flavorful (and i guess saltier) things  the xlb's at ns had soup that was more bland compared to joe's  and the meat at joe's had a lot more flavor as well  i coudln't tell much of a difference between the pork and the shrimp and pork xlb at ns  even the sauce used for the xlb's seemed to have less ginger flavor and saltiness  this may be nit picking  but i thought the xlb skin at ns was a little too tough  i did eat the hot dumplings right away! though they didn't seem as tongue burning hot as the ones i've eaten at joe's  #3 the shanghai udon noodles  i had a version of this at joe's and the noodle quality was so much better  it was still good at ns but it's much chewier (and fatter) at joe's  this dish did seem a bit greasier at joe's  but not by much #4  the price! at ns you get 6 dumplings for more money than you would pay for 8 dumplings at joe's   the beef scallion pancake was good as everyone has said  but after a few bites i didn't really want any more  i did  however  really like their sweetened cold soymilk  ) a huge cup for just a dollar! in terms of staffing and atmosphere  i would say both are about the same  neither one is particularly awesome about friendly and courteous service  though joe's has more servers and thus faster service nan shian's food is pretty good  just comparatively to joe's  i give it 3 stars  because i know i've had better xlb's  there is a lot of debate between who has the best xiao long bao's in flushing  but according to my taste (i do enjoy saltier  more flavorful things and don't mind extra greasy food)  i'm going to have to say joe's shanghai wins this battle for me 
first the good   the soy pea and bean curd app was fantastic    the seafood udon and rice cakes  both also really good  pork buns      i have passed by a hundred times and always busy   always hearing about the xlb     the fried  were honestly not very good    the skin so thick and not crispy  it was bread like    the steamed were good   skin texture was nice but flavor of soup was missing a little something   i prefer taste of shanghai    tea   not very good at all  but hey it's free    service  not so much   somewhere between a 3 and a 4    think i will mainly get soy peas to go and move on   
been here twice now  and the xiao long tang bao (soup dumplings) take me back to the good stuff i had all the time in china greasy  juicy  meaty pockets of soup in chewy  steamy dumpling shells (drool)  i love you  little dumplings today we tried other dishes off the menu as well (yay for taking chinese friends with us)   we especially loved  cucumbers in garlic & oil (really refreshing and palate cleansing after eating all that xiao long bao) beef pancakes  neu rou dan bing (chewey  carby  meaty  hoisen y  awesome  better than their scallion pancakes) fried noodles with chicken and mushrooms  chives egg pancakes (i didn't know these things were also called chives in english  love love love) rice cakes dish (i forgot which one   but like chinese ddukbokee)i think they bought out the store next door and expanded the seating area   now you won't have to wait an hour to eat   we were 5 people and didn't have to wait at all today (1pm saturday)   this made me that much happier 
great xiaolongbao! i was impressed with how tasty and juicy the filling was! however  the only downside is that the skin wasn't strong enough to hold in everything  i had more than half break on me (i swear i know how to use my chopsticks!)  i also don't think there is much of a difference between the regular xiaolongbao and crab xiaolongbao  all in all  delicious and good value!
nan xiang dumpling house  if you're in flushing this is apparently one of the places you need to visit for xiao long baos   not really sure what all the hub bub is about  but they're alright  nothing amazing   service is fast and cleanliness of the restaurant is above average so that's always a plus   it's pretty easy getting a table because the restaurant has two wings with plenty of seating   the food is good but if you're coming from the outer boroughs  it's probably not worth the trip 
the service was mediocre at best  but the food was delicious! the crab soup dumplings were my favorite  and if you want to have something spicy  ask for the beef platter  also  there is this pan fried bun with pork inside it  and it is a must when you are eating taiwanese cuisine  i do recommend! (also it is cash only  so be prepared for that)
went back again and had the pork dumplings  pork and crab dumplings  sweet tofu soup and rice cake with pork  all excellent!!
i would say the food here is only for tourists   the xiao long baos were the worse i have i've ever had   too dry  not enough soup  salty inside to cover up how stale and unfresh the meat was   the spicy tendons were alright   it was spicy  but it does not have the numb effect  so they didn't put enough szechuan pepper   the tendons were also not crunchy enough   i have to comment on the waiters and waitress here   they are the rudest ever   they ignore and walk right past you when you walk in the door   you'll have to wait and then ask to get seated   i already wanted to leave before i even started the meal   then when you wave one over  it takes them two decades before they react because again they keep ignoring you   they will be chatting in their little corner   however  if you are not asian  you'll will be seated very fast as we saw   i should have taken my friend's warning not to have dinner here   i thought it might taste good because it was packed  but i forgot to look what it was packed with   non asians!
highly recommended  crab meat dumplings & beef in scallion pancakethough the wait can be long and the service sub par  the food is just so good  the menu isn't very extensive but everything is delicious 
best dumpling there is in queens  all the reviews by the yelpers said it all  i prefer this place than joe shanghai  also  try the scallion pancake  it's great  expect long line on weekend  well  you need to have patience to get good stuff 
i saw and heard about this spot through a video posted by ny chef eddie huang  this place is a good good lunch  dinner and late night grub spot  the soup dumplings here are big and juicy  but it was hard to grab em without breaking it  and i'm a pro with my chinese utensils  dumplings are good  but not joe shanghai good!
alright  one asian dude  and three cute asian girls all recommended these soup dumplings to me (i know  i should expand my circle of friends)  all within the time frame of a week  the situation was dire  i needed to pay these dumpling ladies a visit  and so  i did i was on a mission  mission objectives were clear & concise  i was to extract most scrumptuos soup dumplings from the hands of the hostile (yet ingenius) soup dumpling ladies  drop off site  the warm and inviting confines of my mouth boy does this place get crowded on weekends  this place was packed with lines rolling out the door  i got pushed and poked around by old folks  strollers  and everything in between  it was all worth it though i enjoyed my dumplings courtside at the nearby park as onlookers stared at me in pure envy  and  to add insult to injury  every so often  i'd throw an arrogant smirk or smile their way  yeah man  i was in soup dumpling heaven  and i wanted everybody to know now  one cannot talk about soup dumplings and not mention joe's shanghai  i ordered the crab flavor soup dumplings  the skin is pretty thin  so you have to be careful; two of them broke on me  the meat filling tastes softer  and fresher than joe's  but  i thought the flavor was slightly sub par when compared to joe's  i'll have to go back to try their standard pork soup dumplings as well as some other dishes as punishment for my post breakfast  but pre lunch dumpling snack  i walked myself home (3 miles)  unfortunately  temptation levels were high  and my immunity level was low  so i stopped off on my route (along roosevelt ave) for some light snacks  sigh   
brilliant dumplings  the scallion pancakes with beef  delicious  pork buns  delicious  watching the ladies make it all  awesome we even found the service somewhat friendly   i totally expected the kind of service you'd expect at a small  busy chinese restaurant  but was surprised at how generally friendly they were oh  yes  it's small ish and they get real busy  you may end up sharing a table  but it is not a huge deal  it's also not super fancy  but you didn't come here for fancy  you came here for the brilliant dumplings i left in a food coma 
this place is michelin guide recommend  zagat rated  yet has barely any english on the outside    and those guys were right  this place is awesome  xlb were soo big and yummy  i should've just stuck w the xlb  instead of going for the udon    but next time i'm coming back and ordering 3 orders of xlb can't wait till i go back 
this is our 4th restaurant we try and oh boy was the dumpling's delicious!!! it was proably the best dumplings i try so far in nyc plus it was crowed but we got a seat right away  at this point we barfely could eat anymore so we just order 3 dumplings for the table and force ourselves to eat them  the dumplings was full of flavor and juice and extremely hot  i think i had to split one out because i ate it too fast loloverall i wish i had more for this morning breakfast 
i came here for lunch on a weekday and was very impressed with my meal here  we ordered the xiao long bao and they were delicious  though hard to get out of their steamer in one piece  i also got the crunch noodles with beef and it was very tasty and flavorful  my boyfriend got a pork soup  which he said was average 
awesome soup dumplings (listed as pork dumplings)  there are six per tray  so when the waiter says that you want four  don't think that there will only be four in the tray  there will actually be a total of 24 dumplings  either way  don't worry  you'll be able to eat 24  my girlfriend and i finished 30 dumplings and a plate of rice cakes with chicken  you'll enjoy this place 
this place has really good soup dumplings   it's nice that as you wait in line you can watch the chefs make them   the price is decent   from what i hear joe's shanghai is cheaper  but i think this place isn't as cramped   i do not have any complaints about their food or their prices  but the waiter did not take our order down correctly  so we didn't get enough of their delicious dumplings  (overall  try this place if you are in flushing and crave some awesome soup dumplings 
i don't know if i could definitely say that this place has dumplings that taste 'better' than joe's (they're definitely not worse than joe's)  but their service staff is def more polite  at joe's i always feel rushed and unwelcome but the atmosphere here seems way more friendly  i was just a little surprised that they serve 6 dumplings instead of 8 in a batch  but it's not a big deal  they also have a rather small menu  but the essentials are all there  if there's a wait  definitely go inside and take a menu to see what you want  service isn't slow but it isn't super speedy like some other places tables are also pretty accommodating for groups up to ~8 people bottom line though  i'm definitely coming back    and probably ditching joe's for a while 
this place is awesome! after the first time i went here with my family i was hooked! the soup dumplings are amazing  and i always order the noodles in scallion sauce as an appetizer   it gets busy  but there are always tables available  and fairly fast service  another cool thing about this place is you can see the women making the soup dumplings from scratch  cheap prices  great food  what more could you ask for? try it!
the service here is nothing to speak of at all       really  if you need to go someplace where they focus on customers first  don't go here  because no matter how good the food is  you will not be happy  i had been warned of this  so i was prepared for the brusque treatment  the dumplings however  were the real star of the night  these are real soup dumplings  not just a small amount of soup these are the kind that you should eat with a spoon  joe's has good xiao long bao  but these are xiao long tang bao  just be prepared to wait for a seat 
grab your gps  your zipcar  the girl you want to impress and drive on out here for a breakfast date adventure  come here now  bring your friends for sweet hot soy milk  for fried dough  for soup dumplings  do it in the morning for the best chinese breakfast in nyc 
better than joe shanghai  hands down  cucumbers  soup dumplings  pork or crab flavors  pan fried dumplings  seaweed  scallion pancake beef   perfect combo occasional side of soy milk and fried dough  fresh  great  problem = crazy busy    no service 
on opposite day i would say "this place sucks  don't ever go here   the staff are mean  and they are slow   the dumplings are thick  cold and have zero flavor "  on reality day i would spend hours going on and on about how floored i was at this place   this place is filled with angels delivering steamy little purses of heaven to your plate go and enjoy (you would be hard pressed not to)   15 orders later and i'm wishing i could be there now 
i love this place! my cousins probably get so sick of me when i visit because i am always bugging them about coming here for their amazing soup dumplings  we eat other things there too but the hot  juicy  succulent pockets of pork and soup are the stuff cravings are made of when we first walk in we ask for several orders of plain pork and pork & crab soup dumplings  they are made fresh so we always order them first to cut down on the waiting time  there are 2 chefs  behind a glass window  who assemble the dough and meat into gorgeous dumplings that they then put into a steamer  within 10 minutes we are gingerly biting into the piping hot morsels and consuming the deliciousness all while trying not to burn our mouths  my cousins prefer the plain pork ones but i enjoy all the flavors of the crab & pork intermingling  i could probably just fill up on the dumplings but the green onion pancakes and the shanghai style pork chow mein are also wonderful word of advice  the service is very typically asian and not the greatest  so don't expect much  however  imo  the food is good enough that it makes up for it 
the food was great  very tight  busy place  but well worth the time and effort
holy jesus  if only i could move right next to this place and grab breakfast every single damn day  the dumplings  the pancakes and the soybean milk = muy bueno  i hate going to flushing because navigating the crowd is complete torture in itself  but whenever i do  this is the one joint that's always on my mind  you know this spot's legit when you can't even properly pronounce its name correctly  i'm chinese  and i don't even know how to pronounce it  is it nan shang or non shong? but really  who cares? satisfy the belly of yours and order the food here  you can thank me later 
good soup dumplings  in my opinion i find nothing distinctly different from joe's shanghai  both are very good
great soupy dumplings   i think ive perfected my way of eating the soupy dumpling from this place   the dumpling size is just right to do the following   bite off the top to allow a spoonful of vinegar to season the soup inside the dumpling and then suck the soup up   yummmmmy   this way  the soup is not too hot cuz its been cooled down a little bit when you opened the dumpling   and then finish the dumpling with more vinegar =) i like this place a lot more than joe shanghai and to top it off    its cheap   the beef noodles though  nothing out of the ordinary   the scallion pancake w  beef were great   just a lil bit on the greasy side
the soup dumplings were tasty  but the skin kept breaking despite my effort in trying to be suuuuper careful with them    ( so there goes 1 star we also ordered the scallion pancakes with beef dish which was yummy  this place gets another star taken off (sorry) because i was disappointed with the shanghai noodles  it looked like something i could've whipped up in my kitchen in 10 minutes with leftover stuff from my fridge  very minimal bok choy & meat 
came here for lunch around 1 30 on saturday  march 1  2014  the place was packed but our party of 3 was seated within 15 mins like the host said (they got this down to a science ) we ordered the pork chop noodle soup  2 orders of pork soup dumplings and an order of fried pork buns (sorry  i don't know the actual name)  the fried pork chops were crispy and delicious but the noodle soup was extremely bland  i would have regretted ordering it if it wasn't considered a godsend by the member of our group who was extremely hungover  the soup dumplings were very good and the fried pork buns were ok  nothing i'd order again next time  and our bill came out to less than $40 making this lunch incredibly awesome 
any place that serves fried food has to have a decent following of fans and this place is no exception  nan xiang dumpling house serves a wide variety of chinese snacks and appetizer like dishes their xiao long bao (soup dumplings) are great and a definite staple  i'm not sure if they're were better than joe's shanghai  but their delicious broth mixed in with ground pork and crab meat were delicious the fried crispy dough is another delectable worth trying and similar in texture and taste to a sugarless zeppeli  the scallion pancake with sliced beef was a perfect blend of what appeared to be hoisin sauce with a slice of beef on a crispy delicately fried scallion pancake  purely delicious overall if you're looking for a nice greasy snack  or you're hungry and don't want to spend too much  give it a shot  you'll be satisfied  but don't expect a healthy meal  and be warned  if you order the soup dumplings  it might take a while for it to arrive depending on the time of day 
pan fried dumplings were amazing! soup dumplings are very good as well  the cucumber with garlic cold dish is great!!! very small menu and not much for customer service  but the food itself is great

omg i miss my beef scallion pancake and steam soup dumping 
we made our semi annual trip to flushing  ny and visited all of our usual restaurants  this is always our first stop since we get there around 10 am each time  i can't believe how crowded this place is no matter the time of day  the soup dumplings are still good and i like how they're different than joe's shanghai  the ones at nan xiang are lighter in flavor and not as oily as joe's but i like them both  the fried dough were cold when the server brought them out  i didn't mind them as much since i dip them in the sweet soy bean milk before i eat them  my wife had a difficult time eating them  she said that they caused her indigestion the rest of the day  in hindsight  we probably should have sent them back nevertheless  i'll still go back for the dumplings when we visit flushing again  we always stay at the best western around the corner and noticed that the owner and the employees park in the lot next to the hotel behind locked gates  the next i visit  i'm going to ask him if he will let me park there   )
i've passed by this place often but finally had the gaul to enter  i'm very glad i finally did  food was great  i had some lamb noodle soup  and 4 fried dumplings  it was absolutely delicious and portions were great 
love their dumplings  very good and cheap  4 people bill came out to 35 and we were beyond full
great stuff all the way except when the line is too long and i can't even stand in the vestibule  85 percent of the dishes i am very happy with here 
i was initially referred to nan shian  not by a foodie buddy with a hard on for asian cuisine (of which yelp has many)  but by my mother (bless her heart)  who has the streets of shanghai running though her veins and has been a veteran flushing diner shopper for over 10 years  so when a restaurant in flushing claims to serve real shanghai soup dumplings  she throws down the judge hammer like no other  if my words don't convince you  her stamp of approval should coming from a family with deep shanghai roots  i have extremely high standards for authentic soup dumplings  the necessities   thin but strong dumpling skin  the most difficult to imitate and thus the true mark of excellency  the epitome being shanghai's din tai fung  a near transparent work of art   rich  flavorful  non greasy broth  great food begins with great ingredients  this is where joe's shanghai has begun lagging  since its broth is now sickeningly greasy  i suspect it's due to cost cutting time saving nan shian's got it all going for them  just ask my mom  and at under $10 per person to be stuffed  it's definitely good bang for the buck others have already described the best method to eat soup dumplings without getting burned  so i'll just add my own slight spin on the technique  instead of taking a small bite from the top of the dumpling when it's on your spoon (which sometimes still results in slightly burning your lip tongue)  i push my dumpling to one side of the spoon and use my chopsticks to gently stretch the skin until a small hole opens up and the soup broth begins to seep through  your spoon will fill but not overflow with soup (read the physics of liquids to know why) and then you can slurp it up at your leisure!second time i came was with my lady and a friend (a flushing virgin)  stuffed to the brim for 30 bucks total (3 orders of soup dumplings  3 savory soymilks  1 fried dough aka you tiao  and 1 app)  still the best shanghai soup dumplings in nyc notes never had to wait more than 5 10 min  as i arrived after the peak times (11am 1pm) order your dumplings asap as they are made to order  i recommend just telling your hostess how many orders of dumplings you want  the moment you're seated don't come here for the fried dumplings or the general tso's or the pork fried rice or the beef with broccoli  you're asking to be fed trash and you should not be surprised if the staff is happy to oblige  1 star for service being the flushing norm aka crappy 
been writing a lot of reviews about places that used to be better  this is another example   the "foodies" have found this place and the restaurant has now expanded taking up 3 store fronts   while seating is now not so much of an issue during dinner time  the quality is not as good as when the first opened with just the one skinny aisle of a restaurant   the xiao long bao has gotten thinner skinned  flat and the flavor isn't quite there anymore   i still go for the cold noodles and the salty soymilk  its still the best xiao long bao around the area  but wishing it was the way they had it when they first opened 
reasons to go to nan xiang for soup dumpling with people who have never had soup dumplings before   you can tell them the general rules for eating soup dumplings and ridicule them when they mess up ie  whoever has the soupiest dish is the biggest dumpling eating failure and must pay for dinner then proceed to laugh and point every time they mess up and spill the soup  watch the caution that first timers take when trying to migrate dumpling from steamer to spoon without breaking the dumpling and then cheer loudly when successful their small plates were awesome  i had some spicy beef tendon in that unforgivingly spicy ma lah oil  marinated seaweed  jellyfish  sliced bean curd tossed in sesame oil and everything was soooooo good  my favorite being the spicy beef tendon and bean curd   they're listed as appetizers on the menu  think of them as lil chinese tapas because you can order a bunch with a bowl of noodles and have yourself a little feast anyway  i haven't eaten in flushing in awhile and was soooooo excited to slurp on some soup dumplings with the family   i never loved joe's shanghai but everyone raved about it back then   these in my opinion are 20x better   the broth is light and flavorful and the meat feels soooo much lighter   i can eat them all not and not feel gross they also have my favorite breakfast foods  salty soymilk and beef wrapped in scallion pancake and those were yummy as well   if you've never tried you must go now!!
the food is decent but they always fuck up our order  i ask for a soybean drink  and they bring me a coke  the food here is also a bit greasy for liking
we've been here a few times and it's one of our go to places on our way home from work and we don't feel like cooking dinner at home the soup dumplings are divine and they are   hands down   the best we've had  the beef & chili soup is good  it's big enough to share  it's almost like having a chinese version of ramen we've also tried the pork & cabbage soup  be warn that it's on the more subtle side of the taste spectrum and it has a lot of cabbage   but the soup base was clean and refreshing the pan  fried pork buns were good and a decent compliment to the soup dumplings with it's more hearty chewiness the cucumber & garlic appetizer is an acquired taste  you better love cilantro cause it's covered with it 
this place is pretty awesome  my boyfriend and i used to always get our soup dumplings from joe's shanghai until we found this little jewel  now we only go here  just be prepared to wait  especially on the weekend  the following are some of our favorites soup dumplings  great! definitely get an order (or two!) you should order these first even if you haven't decided what else to order yet  they take a while to prepare  scallion pancake  delicious  they are rather big  it already comes cut into 3 parts rice cake w  beef  kind of greasy but very good  definitely feeds 2 3 people if you order other items as well all in all a great place to eat!
no place is worth the sh*tty service     the xiao long bao was good but not worth the wait and definitely not worth the crappy service    i understand if they don't speak english but at least learn how to call out the ticket numbers in english as you do have english speaking customers waiting in line holding a ticket    and trust me  even if you stop them and ask them what number they've called out  they will still walk right past you calling out the number in chinese    screw that 
i decided to test out the assertion that nan shian has the best soup dumplings in nyc with a bunch of convives recently  like many  my major experience with the form was via joe's shanghai  a version i still consider after all these years to be rather good turns out  they got nothing on nan shian it took quite a while for them to make our order despite us having timed it to hit the restaurant at an off hour  in the meantime  we got noodles with scallion sauce that were perfectly fine but nothing special  it was more notable for the difficulty of separating it into individual portions  as the noodles were a bit sticky and indeed sometimes seemed like they weren't "noodles" at all but instead a really really long single noodle that we couldn't cut with chopsticks alone when the soup dumplings finally arrived  they certainly looked the part  with wrappers much more translucent than those at joe's shanghai  indeed  while i was trying to demonstrate proper technique for consuming a soup dumpling to my virginal convives  i was afraid i was going to punch a hole in the dumpling as i picked it up with chopsticks  there are few food experiences sadder than helplessly watching the steaming broth drain out from a soup dumpling  after all  luckily for my pride  despite the dangerous amount of sagging that the filling subjected the delicate wrapper to  i did get it successfully onto my spoon  after biting a small hole in the side  i took a sip and put on a brave smile as the plasma hot liquid gave my tongue  oropharynx  and esophagus second degree burns  oh well  that's part of the experience once the pain died down  i was able to appreciate the depth of the broth's flavor  the diaphanousness of the wrapper  the often overlooked juiciness of the pork filling itself even when drained  i almost feel like i shouldn't bastardize them with the english term "soup dumplings" and instead just call them xiao long bao probability of return within 1 year  30%  as xiao long bao still aren't really something i dream about  but this is the first place i'll send anyone interested
great food!probably the best soup dumpling in town!  definitely worth driving all the way from brooklyn   i also love their salty soy bean soup and beef wrapped in pan cake   cold appetizers are yummy too  very authentic  exactly like what you get in southern china   there is usually a wait  but tables turn pretty fast  so not too bad of a wait and it's worth it 
the best dumplings ever!!now that they've expanded you still have to expect a wait   and now because they've expanded the kitchen  they can't keep up with the dumpling orders so they'll tell you that the dumplings will take like 20 30 minutes to order (and this is after you've waited outside for like 45 minutes) to dissuade you in ordering these precious tasty pouches of pleasure   dont be fooled!! stay strong in your order! if you've waited outside for 45 minutes and you don't eat at least 2 orders of this juicy goodness per person  you are an idiot!when we go  we order other stuff too but in all honesty  i would skip everything else and put your stomach to work on the crab meat xiao long bao's   really  don't waste your time ordering anything else   the downside?  i live in oc  and even in la i cannot find a crab meat xiao long bao as good as this   and oh yeah  i can't even eat regular pork xiao long bao anymore either damn you nan shian for being so tasty!!
michelin recommended 2009 and 2010   that's a lot of hype i dropped by with the notorious pig and a few friends after the queens half marathon   we were famished and ready to "pig out "  i wanted some good shanghainese brunch food and i was told i needed to be here   the salty soy bean soup was really good   even had the homestyle burnt soup aftertaste (or just poorly made and reminiscent of my moms cooking   lol)   the sticky rice roll also very good   larger than the ones i get in manhattan chinatown   great complement to the soy bean soup and can be shared with 2 ppl scallion pancake with sliced beef was delish   crispy pancake   very flavorful beef   i can't say i would prefer these highly touted xlb's over anything i can get in my hood    but to a more picky xlb eater   these are definitely 1) less greasy 2) more soupy 3) more compact   they come in orders of 6 instead of 8   the task of finishing an order doesn't seem as daunting   but when was it ever?the pan fried rice cakes were not soft enough   i would've like that they soak them a little longer  the pan fried pork buns were good   actually they are better than i'm typically used to   they are small and less dough ie   the meat is juicy and the bottom of the bun fried to a light crisp   yum we also ordered the scallion oil noodle dish   i could've done without this   the scallion tasted like "carbon" but that's they way its supposed to be made   my mom would've said it was fresh    ok    so we tried almost half the menu   overall good experience   not worth the michelin hype but worthy of yelp praise   i was initially only going to give 4 stars but i can't think of a shanghainese restaurant i like more   5 stars   as good as it gets!
came back here several months ago and the xlbs were as good as the first time   i bumped them up from 4 5 to 5 stars bc the more i eat xlbs from other establishments   the more i find myself comparing them to nanxiang   and no one comes close   plus  they are made to order   since xlbs are their specialty  the turnover rate is high ensuring freshness   conclusion   no comparison   none   again   make sure to squeeze your way through the narrow waiting entry area and get a number   you will thank me for this   especially the non mandarin speakers ; )
i've been coming here ever since they opened about 4 years ago  i remember the long lines  rude waitresses and kick ass soup dumplings  for the longest time  i didn't even know they had other food on the menu  the servers are still rude  the dumplings still kick ass  but the lines were alleviated due to their expansion next door  on my most recent visit back to nyc  i pigged out and had about 4 baskets of dumplings myself  i love this place and i hope they never change their recipe 
shanghai food heaven rice cakes  xiao long baos  scallion pancakes  all some of the best i used to swear by joe's shanghai (and i still do ) this place edges it out  but it is a bit smaller  so sometimes you'll have a longer wait to get a table (not to say that i've ever been to joe's during dinner hours and was able to be seated right away )one thing to note is you only get 6 dumplings instead of the 8 at joe's  but i don't mind the food here reminds me of my time in shanghai  yes  that good i can't vouch for the service if you only speak english and cannot understand chinese  but my chinese isn't that great and i had no issues  but i can't for the life of me remember if they replied in chinese or not 
i was in the neighborhood last saturday morning and i needed breakfast  i figured why not? i walked over and pleasantly no lines to wait  i sat right down and ordered the crab steamed dumplings and a soy milk nothing like having fresh dumplings in the morning!!!!  hhmmm hmmm so lip smacking good!!
the best soup dumplings i have ever had i cannot imagine getting better than this  one has to try to beleive it another favorite of mine  their clear chicken soup  outstanding  i later found out they boil ginsen root in it their crispy noodles and rice cakes dishes  are the best i have had this place has a somewaht limited menu  but everything in it is a "must" 
i heard a lot of positive press about this place  so the family and i trekked out to flushing on our annual nyc trip last month to check it out   the xiao long bao (dumplings) were indeed very good   we ordered both the pork and crab versions and these were excellent  although the soup broth was a bit greasier than i expected   we also ordered a noodle dish that i've since forgotten the name of  and this was also very good   if the service was as good as the food  i wouldn't hesitate to give nan shian five stars  but i can't   it wasn't bad  just indifferent in a way that sort of makes you feel like you're an interloper if you don't speak chinese   everyone there also pretty much ignored us other than bringing tea and water to start  with taking our order a few minutes later and bringing out the food   it just made for a somewhat uncomfortable dining experience   so  to recap food   five starsvalue   four starsservice   two stars
food here is delicious  the xiao long bao is probably the best here  beef dish is also very good  only problem is loooong lines  average wait time is about 20min or more on a weekend night  but the wait is worth it  definitely a good choice 
i came here with my friends for brunch  the wait was at least 1 hour and we had to stand outside under the sun; very uncomfortable  but once i took that first bite of their pork soup dumpling  i decided it was well worth it! the flavors exploded in my mouth! i will never forget the taste! they are the best soup dumplings that i can remember having!
this is probably the only restaurant open at 8 am in flushing  it's a great place to go for breakfast  i recommend the jelly fish with cilantro  soy bean milk  and of course the soup dumplings   service is always pretty bad  but it is likely because it is so crowded there  they do not take credit cards  so bring cash 
3 75 stars    i can't bear to give it 4 due to its non existent service hubby and i came here again because i was seriously craving some soup dumplings   on a tuesday evening  we were able to walk right in with no wait!  amazing since even after they expanded there is usually a line of about 10 people long outside we ordered the crab soup dumplings  the shanghai fried buns  chicken soup  shanghai fried noodles and a soy milk (for hubs)   like an overeager fat kid  i burned my tongue on my first soup dumpling   i can't help it  i haven't eaten one in so long!everything was good except the fried noodles; i'd recommend getting the noodles at joe's shanghai    they're much better there all in all a great meal  albeit very lackluster service   just come here with patience and you'll be fine 
this place is awesome   period seriously though  if you are dying to have the best xiao leung bao  you need to come here   sorry joe shanghai  yours cannot compete   yes it's unfortunate this place is in flushing  so it's def a trek to get here from the city  but it was well worth it   get here before the rush (and preferably with a small party) if you don't want to wait   for 2 of us  we only waited about 5 10 min when we arrived slightly before noon on a sunday   for any of you who are unfamiliar with how seating works at some of these smaller chinese establishments  you will most likely be seated with strangers my sister and i are ridiculous eaters  so we ordered enough food for a family of 4   sweet (hot) soy milk  i personally don't like this stuff  but we both agreed it seemed kinda watery and lacking flavor   xiao leung bao pork soup dumplings  awesome   i am glad we ordered 2 orders (1 for each of us)   the wrapping skin is thin and there's plenty of soup in these things!  beef scallion pancake  felt the need to try this based on the reviews   it was good although extremely filling   probably wasn't the best idea given the other food we wanted to eat   shanghai thick noodles  good and not overly greasy like most places   pan fried pork buns  yumm   i was extremely disappointed that joe shanghai's didn't have this on the menu bc i treat this as a shanghainese staple   the buns were nice and fluffy and the bottoms were properly fried and not too brown we had all this food for around $30   the prices are totally reasonable   we had enough food to take home for another meal p s   cash only!!!
this is the spot for some soup dumplings  get the crab ones  you won't regret it  fresh out of the steamer  the skin is thin and not tough to bite on  a good amount of soup that doesn't contain excessive grease from the meat itself  expect at least a 15 minutes wait for your order  but believe me  it is worth the wait  nothing beats a bunch of asian ladies making your dumplings from scratch in an open kitchen  things i recommend while you wait for your delicious soup dumplings  a hot cold soy beans drink  it is healthy and only a dollar! it tastes freshly grinded from the back and not from a pre packaged container    scallion pancakes are surprisingly good  not overly saturated with oil  though i'm not a fan of it  too much carbs and it fills you up before the dumplings arrive    my favorite appitizer has to be the spicy beef and tripes  it is served cold and generous amount of chili oil over it  if you can't handle spicy food  try it anyway! i tend to order the crispy chicken noodles  unlike the lunch special that you get from a ghetto chinese joint  this one is loaded with yummy goodness  plenty of shredded veggies and chicken  the yellow noodles are perfect  half crispy and half soft over a not overly thick corn starched sauce  stay away from joe's shanghai and their nasty frozen pre made soup dumplings that taste like whatever it is sitting next to it in the freezer  as far as service  if you are gonna eat in flushing  it is almost non existent  but you will get awesome food  a fully and happy belly without breaking your bank   this is the spot!
i can't believe i did not review this  my favorite soup dumpling restaurant in flushing  joe's shanghai can't even beat this  i am chinese so you better take my word for it  they have pretty limited items on their menu  mostly noodles and chinese appetizers but those are usually good for breakfast and lunch my usual will be soy bean (warm)  scallion pancakes  spicy beef noodle soup or beef rice cake and of course crab  soup dumplings  enough said  if you don't try it  you will never know 
love the dumplings  beef scallion roll and crispy noodles 
although the sign has no english  you'll know you're in the right place by the huge line outside the door   was it worth the 6 block hike from the hotel and 30 minute wait?  most definitely!  the hubs and i had the onion cake with beef  spicy beef noodle soup  and juicy pork dumplings   the onion cake with beef was super tasty   it was nice and crispy on the outside and soft in the inside   it had a sweet brown sauce  possibly a hoisen sauce?  anyway  it was good   the spicy beef noodle soup was not too spicy   it had just enough kick to it   the beef in the soup was cut in bite sized pieces and it was very tender   the noodles were cooked al dente  just the way i like them   the broth was very tasty  it warmed my soul   yum!the juicy dumplings were fresh and super duper juicy   be careful because you will burn your taste buds off!  i actually enjoyed them without the dipping sauce   they were nice and flavorful on their own   also  the texture of the skin was perfect  not too thick or thin   it held everything together very well     if you're in queens  this place is definitely worth trying out   they also had a bunch of other stuff that looked appetizing 
went here this weekend and wow  the line was out the door but don't get intimidated  the wait isn't bad at all because they took over the connecting restaurant next door  there is more space on the other side and the food and service is fast  we had 3 adults and 1 baby  they were really accomodating on the hot food and drinks near kids  must order the soup bun  soy milk  and beef pancake  great lunch place  haven't had good food in flushing in a long time!
during college  my friends and i would drive down to din tai fung many post drinking sunday mornings   xiao long baos were the ultimate hangover cures     since moving to manhattan  i've tried to recreate this sunday ritual but no places i've tried come anywhere near the deliciousness of dtf  too big  too thick  too dry  something was always off   and i'm sad to report that nan xiang falls into the "close  but not close enough" category   the dumplings are pretty thin but they are huge  so 6 will be more than enough person   there is plentiful juice in every bite at just the right temperature (hot enough to burn your tongue) but the liquid is waay too oily for my liking   towards the end of my meal  i could almost feel the oil separating and rising to the top of my stomach   i tried to emulsify my stomach contents w  a side order of vinegar cucumbers  but they were soggy and not too flavorful   the shanghai rice cakes are also oily but the chewy texture of rice cake contrasting with the crispness of green onions is addicting!  during prime brunch time  prepare to wait ~25 30 minutes for a party of 4  ten ren's is just around the corner so get yourself a drink first (sin boba   save your stomach for the dumplings!)
when we can't figure out what to eat  this place is in a pile of our "what to eat" toss up list  their dumplings are good  and their noodles are pretty good too  maybe it's because it's been a place frequented so often  and for so many years  that i don't know if it warrants the all five star   but the food is good and has been so consistently  the wait can be long on the weekends  and it has a madness feel to it during peak lunch dinner hours  but you won't mind it so much once you get your eating thing going 
xlb here is excellent   as other reviewers have noted  the skin was thin and the innards extra soupy!  we got the pork and the crab meat dumplings   delicious!other highly recommended dishes  noodle with scallion sauce  cucumber & garlici didn't love the scallion pancake with sliced beef because i thought they overdid it with the hoisin sauce & it was too sweet  but the three other people i came with enjoyed it 
absolutely below average restaurant! no service  poor food quality ! how often have you seen "c" sanitation rated chinese restaurant!  there are a least hundreds of chinese restaurant around 5 blocks radius  you will be happy not coming here
i love this place because i love their xiao long bao!  i went to new york specifically requesting that i eat dumplings during my trip   this  however  was my first time at nan shian and i swear i ate an entire bamboo steamer of the dumplings and that would mean i ate "6"   i tried both pork and crab and can't decide which i like better   you bite off the tops of these little babies and pour a little bit of ginger vinegar inside  drink some of the soup  and take a big bite  careful not to lose any of the soup   so delicious!besides the xiao long bao  i also enjoyed the scallion pancake with sliced beef and rice cake with shredded pork   i love the chewiness of rice cake!i was there for lunch on a weekday so there was no wait and i don't remember service being that bad   i must go back!
i followed yelp to check in this place  i tried 3 dishes  scallion pancakes; soup dumplings (crab & pork); seafood noodles  i only satisfied with soup dumplings  the other two   i only tasted them  scallion pancakes had puffy chewy dough with almost no scallion and a small dry slice of beef inside with beijing duck sauce  the taste was ok  but it was not worth to give up my diet  the seafood noodle was bad   cheap frozen noodle with frozen fish and soup with no base  i will pass  after these two dispoointed dish  i had soup dumplings which was very nice  they put a lot of ginger inside which gives good aroma and taste  the dough was not too thick nor thin  the staffs were all nice  but the service was sub par  i would say soup dumplings   5 stars; everything else   2 stars
great food! the dumplings were awesome and the pancakes were delicious! will definitely stop by when i'm in town again 
if you are ever in the queens area and craving soup dumplings  i would definitely try this place  a friend took me here once for the first time  it a bit hard to find in my opinion  away from the hectic streets of main street  but it's a hidden gem! everything on the menu is super affordable and my favorites are the soup dumplings and scallion noodles  if only i lived in flushing again  i would eat there every week 
excellent soup dumplings!!  don't know what more to say about this place   the worst part about writing yelp reviews is that it always makes me super hungry   i could go for some soup dumplings right now 
many friends recommended this place and since i lived so close and never had a chance to try  i decided to go on a lunch break with my boss one day  even though it was lunch time and there were a tons of people  we easily got a table since the restaurant was pretty big  we got an order of the crab meat xiao long bao  an order of beef noodle soup and an order of chicken pan fried noodle   that sounded fairly easy to get done  right? the noodle soup and pan fried noodle came fairly fast and since lunch break does not last forever  soon we finished the noodles  we waited and waited  our xiao long bao never came  i asked our unattentive waitress at least three times that if the order isn't done  it's okay  however  she kept on trying to tell us that it was almost done and just made us sit there for a good 15 mins without food on the table  when she finally came  she almost knocked into a baby and spill it all over  such a scene gave me chills up my spine  the food was awesome and i will return because of the food only  however  they need to improve on the service  i was really disappointed with the service 
listen  nan shian is in flushing no   seriously   everything you could hope to say about nan shian can really be summarized in that first sentence   when i come here it means an epic subway journey   not just leaving manhattan  no when you step out at the end of the 7 you've culturally left the country   its a long ride  but these are soup dumplings worthy of a pilgrimage   they will ruin you for all other nyc soup dumplings   you will think back to them fondly and treasure the absent memory to those who think the service is super slow  you're may be doing it wrong   in my experience  at nan shian they just don't subscribe to the usual"i'm your waiter  i'll drop by and say hello to take your order"   if you want your food to come quickly then do like the locals and flag down a waitress when ever you need anything   ready to place your order?  chances are about 50 50 that no one will come by for it unless you make some serious eye contact and waving motions   like i said  this is flushing  finally  it is worth reiterating  the place is small and ultra popular  so if you are bringing a large group and expecting to sit down swiftly your expectations may need to be adjusted   but coming as a group of 2 i've been able to get seated right away even when the line is starting to peak out the door five stars for soup dumplings worthy of a journey 
i haven't been back here for quite awhile  on my recent visit the soup dumplings and some of the appetizers are very delicious  the soup dumpling itself was delicious but the skin is still thick and sometimes you can see a little of extra dough left on the side of one or two dumpings  you can always scrape it off  love the taste of the soup inside the soup dumplings  the appetizers we had was the scallion pancake with beef  spicy beef tendons  spicy bamboo shoots  the sweet tofu with bean curd  and the jelly fish with turnip  the spicy dishes are always good  the tofu with bean curd is one of my favorite dishes  it's cold but sweet  this is my first time trying out the jellyfish with turnip and i felt disappointed  there was alot of turnip and so little jellyfish  i had better jellyfishes in other places  the scallion pancake with beef is another of my favorite dishes  it's crispy on the outside and sweet on the inside  the service was great  it improved alot 
i really like the dumplings especially the crabmeat  these savory pork dumplings are the best! i used to go to another shanghai dumpling place which has lost its quality  the wait here is always ridiculously long during the weekends  make sure you come early! this place is the spot for xiao long bao  i usually am a regular  i come here at least once a week and all my family members love this place  a really popular noodle is the shanghai noodle which is stir fried  i would say this is ehhh  another is the noodle soup which is the cabbage and pork one  one highlight of this noddle is it comes with fresh cabbage and not the preserved type  they get extra kudo points  i can never get tried of this place!
i think nan xiang has the most legit shanghainese "dumpling" (xiao long bao) that you can find in nyc   aside from the xiao long bao  the beef pancake  beef noodle and salty soy milk are the must order whenever i go there   i don't know if its the food ornwhat but theres something about nan xiang makes me want to go back once a while 
hands down  the best xiao long bao ever!i've been a regular customer here for 3+ years now  trust me  it's worth the wait  everything on their menu is so freakin good! know how many orders of xiao long bao you will need  and order them right when you get seated  it takes a long time for them to make it  also  i always order the stir fried udon and rice cakes when i go  they're really yummy  the only complaint i have is that some of their servers can be a little rude sometimes  but i think that's because they're so busy running around 
i will give them 4 stars because i had a mild case of food poisoning last time   i thought my stomach was better than that!  order   beef noodle soup (spicy is good but non spicy is even better)  chewy handmade tasting noodles in a really beefy broth   i had a stomach full of soup waving from side to side when i walked out of the place   it's so good that i was still craving this the next day (while i felt nauseas all day)xlb's because everyone gets them   they aren't my most fave soup dumplings but they are pretty good   the meat is flavorful  of course juicy and it tastes "loose"  the wrapper seems to be too cost effective   i like my xlb wrapper's translucent and thin   they probably use thicker ones to prevent breaking and leakage   soy bean milk to wash down all the msg and salt afterwards  )  yum  comfort food doesn't get better than this!
"service isn't so great  but the delicious xlb makes up for it! stick to the original and don't get the one with the crab  hands down more tasty than joe's"
must try the pork and pork with shrimp soupy buns  good prices  fast service  delicious food 
love this place!  great food  not to mention awesome prices   there is always a wait on the weekends but it goes fast because service is fast i've gotten all the cold appetizers and they are all delicious   however  the last two times i went they sold out of at least one dish we wanted to order the chicken soup is surprisingly good   tastes really clean and non oily   the soup buns are also clean and non oily   i want to eat here  like  all the time 
not bad friend took me there had a beef soup  not big on soup but it made me think about checking out more places with soup
an awesome place to eat at for my first time in flushing! granted  we had to wait about 30 40 minutes because we came in a party for six  but the food came so quickly that they were easily forgiven  i have a big heart   so i was probably the least chinese in the group and just let my friends order  i'm totally going to get the names wrong      (we ordered   1) spicy beef and tripe  i loved the texture and the cilantro  i polished off the plate at the end of our meal even though i was stuffed! i can't help but eat food when it's sitting right in front of me   2) chicken soup  mmm light and flavorful  if i was sick and bedbound  i would definitely want this  )3) pork chop noodle soup  i can imagine how great this would taste on a rain day or after a night of drinking   but would probably pass on this  4) noodles with scallion sauce  so simple but so delicious! do order this one!5) noodles with beef and green peppers  meh  i think we ordered too many noodle dishes   6) shanghai noodles  very much preferred these thick noodles over the noodles that were in the soup  scavenged through all the carbs to pick out the veggies in this dish  welp  that's my vegetable intake for the day   6) spicy wontons with peanut sauce  the skin wasn't as soft  but still delicious!7) crab & pork vs  pork xlb  i preferred the soup and filling of the crab version  but both of them had so much soup  couldn't stop slurping  i think i burned my tongue    and spilled soup all over the table  sigh  wasted soup! for all this and some soy milk  it ended up being about $14 per person  what a wonderful place to pop my flushing cherry! heh  now i need to go eat a salad   
this place gets 3 stars because it was great  but service is declining  it's to be avoided on weekends unless you want to wait 1 hour to get a table  small plates  soup dumplings  etc are great  but try to go on a weeknight!
i am thankful to all previous yelpers because if not for their write ups  we wouldn't have known about this place   their dumplings and noodles are amazing! it's true they are made fresh and you can definitely taste the difference   shame on me for feeding my family instant  microwaveable crap  like some have said  do not expect kiss ass service here  just say what you need whenever you need it   they won't be coming to your table every now and then to ask "how is everything going for you?"  they have dumplings to roll!  it's really a small place so i imagine it's hard to be seated right away if you come as a group   payment is cash only   and parking can be found around the corner  on a metered lot 
i was introduced to nan shian dumpling house during the asian feastival and loved their steamed pork dumplings   the wait for dinner was about 15 to 20 minutes on a weekday  looks like they can only accommodate about 50 people in their two rooms   we ordered their steamed pork dumplings  steamed crabmeat & pork dumplings  the fried crispy noodles with beef and rice cakes with beef   both dumpling orders were good  but i definitely liked the crabmeat & pork dumplings more; i think the crabmeat added more flavor into the soup inside   both the noodles and rice cake were delish   finished it up with an order of the sweet soy bean milk to go overall this place is great for some cheap eats; it won't do any damage to the wallet   the portions could be a tad bigger  but who cares  the food quality is well worth it   more of a reason to order a different variety to try other things 
mj's star   3price   beef & tripe $5 50  scallion pancake with sliced beef $3 50  steamed crab meat & pork buns $6 25  beef & chili pepper noodle soup $5 95 (except tax & tip  cash only)
i've passed this place along that row of restaurants  and realized that it was always packed with a large group of people waiting  go figure  i heard about it later and wondered did it really live up to the hype? i do like my soup dumplings  these are definitely different from joe's  joe  i think we need to talk  no its not you   really its not you    first off  pork dumplings  the purist in me could taste the cabbage more than the pork  and there was sesame oil? it wasn't your basic pork soup bun that's for sure  very flavorful  off to the crabmeat one  damn you taste the crab more  you acknowledge its presence and it commands you to keep eating  kudos for the soup buns  i'll definitely eat you on a cold day!ordered the spciy beef noodle  the beef was tender  the noodles were so soft  the peppers were a bit spicy  its a slow burn that builds up over time  it doesn't hit you all at once  so if you have a low threshold for spicy foods  you may want to share this one with someone  i can't handle spicy foods but this one was pretty tolerable  then again i'll spicy foods till i cry if its good this place is definitely worth trying out  sorry joe  its not you  its me   i think we need space  i think we need to see other people 
nobody is kidding about those soup dumplings  i really need to try more than just the scallion pancakes  dumplings  and other "popular" items  but anticipate that they're just as delicious and authentic as what i ate 
our monthly stopping grounds  i've noticed the crowds are getting bigger and the wait is getting longer    with the little one  we have to get seating for 3 now  so thats another factor to the long wait   this past weekend  i was hungry and in my "duh duh" mode  wife asks  what number are we  i say 9  the lady is screaming numbers from 23 30 something    so i'm thinking  great  we have a nice wait    the lady starts to shout numbers from one and up  repeating numbers and crossing numbers out since some just leave  then five  five  five and six  six six  the guy that has seven is standing there saying  they left and was soo happy his seven got called  =in they went     so i'm standing there in my "duh duh" mode with wife and baby  carseat in tow     then the lady goes 12 13 and so on    wife says  aren't we 9   ? i say oh yea  she skipped us in my "duh duh" reply     i pull out the paper  getting ready to put my hey  i've been here the whole time sort of look    then to see  i was number six    not nine    who knows how many more minutes i wasted   lady felt bad for me and was very apologetic  i just went along and played it off   when i'm hungry  it's like the world is falling apart for me and i need an energy boost    just like the video games    i get weak  weaker and enter the extreme "duh duh" mode when i get hungry   final tally for our meal  which was a record setting sitting for use  4 orders of soup dumpling  spicy wontons  and one of those side dishes    we got our fix for at least the next month    our normal order is 3  but 4 was just too much  good but not comfy at all      s**tt*ing lava!!
so very delicious! i'm a fan of soup dumplings and i have to say their pork dumplings are better than shanghai joes  they make a terrific crispy beef rice cake that's to die for! not to mention the very best scallion pancakes   one downside    i was starving an hour later wishing i got food to go!
for my birthday one year  an ex took me on a soup dumpling tour of manhattan  we hit about a dozen places in a few hours  which allowed me to understand the traits of a good xiaolongbao  unfortunately  we did not visit nan xiang that time  but if we had  perhaps we might have still been together  i think these are the finest xlbs in nyc  and they have the power to form new relationships and strengthen existing bonds  i'm serious  go ahead  pluck a stranger off the street and offer an order of the dumplings  you'll have a friend for life  if that doesn't work  the noodles in scallion oil should  or perhaps the turnip cakes  if you strike out with those  you're better off finding someone else 
great soup dumplings! i actually came here twice in one weekend  the first time was pretty good  but the second time had even more soup filled dumplings so it was even better  they had a great array of really good shanghainese foods also  it gets pretty crowded during the prime dining times (especially on the weekends  sunday lunch is the heaviest crowd  i think) but the wait is well worth it  if you're a fan of soup dumplings  definitely visit!
beautiful place  very peaceful environment  food was great and we didn't wait that long  we didn't really know what to order  but the waitress was very nice and helped us to decide what to get  our tea cups were filled constantly and that was something that i value a lot  in general  it was a great experience 
best soup dumplings this side of the east coast!!!!!nan shian is a billllllllllllion times better than joe's shanghai   trust me   i know my xiao long tang bao   nan shian dumpling house has the closest soup dumplings to the soup dumplings from the motherland (taiwan)   since there are no din tai fung chains on the east coast   nan shian you take the title of best xiao long tang bao in eastern america   yum!  dear nan shian  you make my heart happy  )
you come here for what they are good for    soup noodles and soup dumplings  the soup in the soup dumplings is really good and the meat quite flavorful  but do not order the crab meat soup dumplings  the crab meat did not taste good  for the guy who wrote that his soup dumplings fell apart as a con   he just doesn't know how to eat soup dumplings  the soy milk is not bad  especially when it is warm  but i hate the skin that slowly forms! the turnip turnovers are really good  if a bit salty  do not come here for other things   the rice cakes are only so so  and the jelly fish is a sparse amount compared to the amount of pickled carrots and daikon it is served with  i am not taking any stars off for this  because you should come here for what it is good for!also  i am not taking any stars off for how long you may have to wait during prime hours  or the small space for seating  because that is what you should expect  and it's pretty good for a small chinese eatery 
my partner stumbled across nan shian when she started a new job over on prince street  she immediately dragged me there for a mid week lunch   it was cold (or as we say in queens "it's m*$@therf*@king cold out!") but that didn't deter the folks waiting outside in a line   the line tells you everything you need to know  families with small children  single working folk  and friends   we were standing with an older chinese woman who had stopped on her trek from new jersey out to long island for lunch   let's be honest here  if you're looking for a place with good food  you want to see this kind of variety in line waiting to eat there  especially since you're surrounded by about 400 other restaurants within a three block radius other reviewers have mentioned that this place is small  yes  indeed  plan to share a table if your party is four people or less  but that's true in most of flushing's restaurants  and it gives a good excuse to share conversations  and once seated  i did not feel rushed to leave  even with the line out the door and snaking down the block the manager was delighted to see us  my partner had been there the day before for take out  and the manager was disappointed that she couldn't stay to eat  when she returned with me she said  "i told you i'd come back " and the the manager smiled and nodded happily we came of course  for the soup dumplings  listed on the menu under "shanghai dim sum "  we'd been warned in advance that the soup dumplings can take a while to come to the table (they are hand made on order)  but standing in the cold for 20 minutes made me hungry  so i also ordered the crispy noodle with shredded chicken the four empty seats at our table were quickly filled by a family of four (parents with one grandparent and one grandchild) who immediately had the soy milk soup and fried dough served to warm them up   i was tickled to see that the toddler was given a take out plastic container with plastic fork and spoon  rather than the usual place setting   and useful for small hands unskilled at opening a soup dumpling! (not to mention the lack of loud banging that children that age can create with a soup spoon against a small plate )the crispy noodles were excellent   they weren't the only noodles in the dish   udon also laced its way through  and the plate was infused with a brothy warmth that loosened the last of the chill that had planted itself in my toes   nice capped mushrooms punctuated the dish  cabbage provided a nice alternative crunch to the noodles  the combination of texture and flavor (which i augmented from time to time with the vinegar soy and ginger sauce) filled my mouth very nicely we were sipping tea after consuming that dish when our soup dumplings arrived  along with the soup dumplings for our table companions  thin skins  plopping nicely across the soup spoon  made it easy to bite the top and let the broth seep across the spoon  i found the broth to be wonderful  and not greasy  the kill was flavorful  rather than having given up its goodness into the broth   the dumplings are marvelous  and perfect for a cold day to warm you through and through  i will be coming back here on a regular basis to work my way through the rest of menu a caveat  my partner and i are often the minority "white faces" in flushing restaurants  but as long time flushing residents  we also have little fear of eating in places where we can't read menus  at nan shian  the folks who waited on us understood our english just fine  and spoke english well enough for business purposes   (our asian friends usually get the harder treatment than we do in these places in that "you're too good to speak your parents' tongue" kind of way)  also  we have lots of patience when it comes to talking with wait staff across language barriers  if you don't  then you have two choices  1) eat elsewhere or 2) take a deep breath  wear your humility on your sleeve and practice your good manners  queens is a borough of hard working immigrants who deserve your respect and gratitude 
best dumpling in queens
i always see a crowd of people waiting to get seats when i walk by and finally got to try it (2x in 2 weeks)   this place is decent only for the pork soup dumplings and the scallion pancakes  but be warned that the soup dumplings take a very long time    my main gripe is that they seem extremely cheap with the ingredients  as i came to the realization that my stir fried beef with rice cake had 2 tiny pieces of beef that's barely visible to the eye  the table next to me complained to their waitress that their crab soup dumplings had no crab  unfortunately for them  they got a bite of cardboard instead   i feel this place does not deserve the michelin recognition and falls below standard   i'll be going to the shanghainese restaurant across the street instead   no  that place isn't fantastic  but at least i don't have to wait 30 minutes to eat cardboard 
i'm only a fan of the soup dumplings  the nan xiang one  not the crab flavor one  there's not much crab flavor in the crab soup dumpling if you compare with joe's shanghai's  breakfast is good with soup dumplings  soy bean drink and beef in scallion pancake  don't get the leek empanada  that thing doesn't have much filling and the crush wasn't that great  i ordered some soup noodle before and the noodles are too soggy  we also ordered the pan fried pork buns  i think they fried it a little to much and the bottom is all burnt  other things on the menu are pretty typical shanghainese stuff  try not to sit by the door  it gets drafty in the winter  the other room can be stuffy in the summer too  i guess try to sit in the main room away from the doors 
my friends have what they call "soup dumpling night" just so they can get together for  you guessed it  xiao long baos (soup dumplings)  cucumber & garlic? good  spicy bamboo shoots? good  shanghai pan fried udon? good xiao long bao? gooooooooooood  get both the pork and crab meat xiao long baos  don't think  just do  you'll thank me later  i kept this review short and to the point so that you'd go try nan xiang already  so why are you still reading this???
everyone who comes to ny always insist on going to joe shanghai for shanghainese dumplings but i don't agree that that's the best here   i think the best as of now would be nan shian dumpling house in flushing   their dishes seem more authentic and the xiao long bao is definitely tastier and their skin is thinner   i usually order sweet soy milk  xiao long bao (crab meat)  fried rice cakes  sour cabbage with pork noodle soup  and  turnip cakes  of course not just for myself   the place is cheap and plentiful   always a long line  they recently expanded so service is definitely alot slower   their standards have gone down because they can't catch up to the crowd   we went there once at night after the expansion and it turned out ok   we came to the conclusion that they just can't keep up so alot of the food were either over steamed or just sitting at the counter waiting to be sent out to the table   so if you want the real experience go at night 
mediocre at best  xiao long bao was ok but nothing better than what you get at joe shanghai  everything else was pretty tasteless    scallion pancakes  pork and cabbage soup  and a rice cake dish are all included in that  i wouldn't make the trek there again  nan shian just further proves to me that you can only good great chinese food on the west coast  sorry ny  i wish it wasn't true 
worth the long ride out  get the garlic cucumbers and then just go hog nasty on all of the soup dumplings you can
pretty standard fare  was told by others that the pork soup dumplings would be better here than the one's at joe's shanghai nope  i'm sticking to the js in chinatown  thank you very much  they are tastier and you get 8 per serving    not a paltry 6 
horrible service and not a clean place! we found a piece of metal in one of the dumplings  we showed it to the waiter and he didn't say anything  all he said was i will remove that from your bill  we tried to tell him this is dangerous to other customers and he should tell his owner manager to do something about it  he reacted like it has nothing to do with him  i'm really disappointed in nan xiang  never go back again!
 the best soup dumpling place in all of nyc  way better than joes shanghai imo   there almost always a wait and the place is small so not much room to wait either    you can park right across the street in the muni lot   my regular orders are the crabmeat soup dumplings  spicy beef noodle soup  the cabbage pork noodle soup  and the spicy beef tendon  these things neverrrrrr go wrong  a filling dinner here only costs me and the bf $25 total  the only thing i dont really like is the cramped seating  and how they sometimes make u share tables with strangers  and the bad rude service  (they know you're gonna be coming back b c the food is just that good )  but rudeness is to be expected at a chinese restaurant in a "chinatown" unfortunately  ___ 
i wish flushing were closer  came here with the fiance (this is becoming a theme to my yelp reviews) and we ordered the steamed pork dumpling (better than joe shanghai)  salty tofu porridge  deep fried bean curd with vegetables (slightly sweet  very oily)  and cucumbers (refreshing after all the heavier dishes)  everything was great and cheap  i'm only taking off one star because they repeatedly ignored our requests for a water refill  i wish i knew how to speak chinese!
the only good part about rooming in flushing every time i come to ny is that the chinese food here is so legit! nan xiang certainly exemplifies this rule breakfast here is pretty good  i remember i really liked their soy milk and porridge (not together of course  haha )their house specialty lies in their name  no need to read between the lines here  the classic pork is probably the best version of xiao long bao i've tried  the dough is thin and flimsy  so picking up the bao without tearing the skin is always a suspenseful challenge (and it's pretty embarrassing if you're asian and end up spilling all the "soup ")i love their shao mai too  the dough is even thinner; it is literally nothing more than a membrane  the sticky rice inside has a flavor that is well balanced  so i can go on a marathon eating these  not so much with the dumplings  which are richer if you ever go to flushing  do try the dumpling house even though you have to wait almost forever for seats during peak hours (supper )
i was very disappointed by the lack of selection of dishes  despite having the restaurant half empty  the serving was extremely slow  and they forgot to serve the appetizer we ordered yet still charged it to our bill 
i forgot i came here months ago with some colleagues  but my bf has been craving soup dumplings for some time  so we decided to venture into flushing and try their much acclaimed dumplings  what can i say? once again  a hit! it was very rainy and cold outside  and i was in the mood for a soup  so we shared a salty soybean milk  i don't particularly like the sweet one in general  but i will always go for the salty one and they made a good one  with chinese breadsticks and fermented small pieces of fermented veggies  we also had a scallion pancake  but they made the wrong order and stuffed it with beef and hoisin sauce  it was a bit too much for me  the soup dumplings were excellent! alot of soup inside  but it wasn't too greasy and all flavour!  we also tried the veggie steamed dumplings  which happens to be my favorite! they were sooo good!wow   i understand now why there is a line all the time  even when its pouring cats and dogs out  the food is that good!
oh my goodness this place has salty soy milk! my absolute favorite taiwanese breakfast food ever  and i have been hunting for this all over the city  it was lacking the pickled radishes and needed a little more texture (more vinegar  maybe?) but i was so satisfied  and only $1 75! the scallion pancake was a little disappointing  lacked the true flakiness and they didn't have the option to add egg to it (sad!) and it only had a couple flecks of scallion  but oh well! the xiao long bao was delicious and filling  much better than joe's or shanghai cafe  with a slightly thicker skin and gushing soup  they were a little expensive ($5 50 for 6 of them) but they're also a little bigger than joe's or shanghai cafe's  and no gimmicks  they stick to pork and pork and crab only next time  i noticed that other tables had scallion pancake with sliced beef inside  will definitely try that  and get the pig ears cold appetizer! lots of spicy zing and chewy texture that's a fun new thing to try  )as usual in flushing  cash only!
their spicy beef noodle is mediocre   their steamed dumplings are okay   i sat across an old lady from beijing  she said she would never eat at this place again   about their steamed dumplings  i had the pork crab ones  and the crab meat was very little and not fresh  or flavorful   i've had true steamed dumplings   i believe this place is very popular with people b c of the low prices   despite this  the service was good  and the restaurant appeared to be clean 
flushing fridays!  after a hard week of work   my friends and i all head over to flushing for some good and cheap food   it's a ritual of ours  and this place is one of my favs!out of all the places in nyc  these are my favorite soup dumplings (xlb)   better than joe's and shanghai cafe   i take my friends from out of town here  and it never lets me down   their xlb are always tasty and filled with soup   their side dishes are pretty solid too   from the cold appetizers  i usually get  spicy bamboo shoot   or if you don't like spicy  try the jellyfish with turnip  it's light  tasty  and good for hot days   from the hot apps  i get the pancake (green onion pancake dough) with sliced beef and hoisin sauce   both good and will satisfy you until the main reason you came  the soup dumplings arrive they have expanded but i haven't experienced the horror stories of waiting an hour yet after sitting down   you probably still need to get there early or you'll have to wait    hopefully i won't have to and they'll get that worked out soon so more people can enjoy their xlbs 
this turns out to be one of our best meals at new york   loved the garlicy cucumber  salty soybean  xiao long bao  crispy dough  and rice cakes   will come back again next time i visit new york!
regarding the food  the best xiao long bao's in the country  end of story  service is quick and the food comes out fast  not as greasy and doughy as joe's shanghai  bigger portions (and cheaper prices)  slightly thicker skin than din tai fung  with the same savory meat and clean tasting soup  next time i'm in ny over a weekend  it's straight to flushing for more nan xiang dumplings  plus they have a small taiwanese breakfast menu offering  a combination of soybean milk  fan tuan's and xiao long bao's equals  quite literally  the best asian brunch known to man 
the food is pretty decent  no complaints here  i always get their scallion pancake with beef  crispy  shanghai style scallion pancake with beef and hoisin sauce in the middle  like a sandwich  awesomeness the low rating comes from their service  they're very inattentive to their customers (damn asians)  you can ask for tea  and it won't come  you can ask for the check  and it'll come  you try to order more  but instead they bring you the check  they don't really bother too much with communication unless they recognize you as a regular my tip is to try to estimate how much you're going to order  and then ask them to leave a teapot or water pitcher on your table so you can just self serve 
sooooo good  and very sweet service    as a caucasion english speaking american in this area  i don't always feel as though some stores appreciate my business   this place not only is delicious but fun to go to    
i'm in love   i recently went on a dumpling tour in china town   well  not such more legitimate  tour  but i did get vegetable dumplings from 4 different spots  and compared   every place  had fresh dumplings  naturally some better than other   but all spots served god dumplings   i do not find dumplings like that in queens   there are a handful of places i go to for chinese take out in queens   but  i have yet to find good dumplings   they are always so thick and doughy   that rule of course does not apply to flushing  queens   i do not go to  flushing  often   i go to chinatown more often  but  i recently went to nan xiang   i did a quick google search for dumplings in flushing and i choose nan xiang   unfortunately  there website is still under construction   i had to search some more to find their on line menu   once  i did i was able to place an order of vegetable dumplings  scallion pancakes  and bean curd with mixed vegetables   the pancakes were very soft   and delightful   the dumplings were great  just as good as the dumplings in manhattan's china town  the bean curd with mixed vegetables was also very good   however  there was no vegetables at all   it was shredded firm bean curd  with light seasoning   typically  when i get that dish  there are big chunks of sauteed and fried bean curd  with broccoli  snow peas  onions  etc swimming in garlic or brown sauce    given the name of the dish  i was expecting some vegetables   there was nothing in the menu description  indicating that it was shredded bean curd  without actual vegetables    in any event  i really enjoyed it    the dumplings had to be good   it's part of their name   i love when the filling of a dumpling is as fresh as could be  the same goes for the actual dumpling 
to anyone who loves soup dumplings  this is probably your best bet  short of having to travel to another continent   the dumplings are nice and soupy   also tried the scallion pancake  and it was very good   the service is rushed and the place really needs to expand  as there is always a line out the door   still  i'm going to say that these are the best soup dumplings i've had in ny  and it's absolutely worth a visit 
alright  this review is based upon two visits  one in the summer of 2007 and in september 2009   i've read the other reviews and was surprised that this placed received so many good reviews   based upon my first visit  in 2007  this place definitely matched up to joe's shanghai and joe's ginger (the manhattan locations)   somehow  something happened during the past two years because when i visited 2 months ago the dumplings were horrible   the skins were not as thin as they were in the past   the soup was thin and runny and was nearly translucent   pork soup dumplings should have an unclear broth  finally the meat was good  but not seasoned  another minus was that they only give you 6 dumplings compared to 8 at joe's in manhattan's chinatown  but i knew this ahead of time   my benchmark for great soup dumplings remains with joe's ginger and joe's shanghai   on any given day  they have their up and down days  such as runny soup or broken skins  but that is only 5% of the time   finally  as for the service  it was horrible   during my second visit  they gave us the wrong order of dumplings  after they promised to replace our order  we waited almost 30 minutes before i got someone's attention and told them we will leave  so they should give us the check without the dumplings   only then  did they serve us our dumplings   that was really bad service and it couldn't be that they didn't notice us  because there was a line out the door and i was sure they were keeping an eye on the tables to turn them over   oh well  this proves to me that your restaurant is only as good as the chef and service  as always 
love the food here! just like the xiao lon bao i get in shanghai  if you want some shanghainese foood  just come here 
our lunch bunch assembled in front of nan xiang xiao long bao  a block away from my office  i've been self designated the neophyte of the group  'cause i don't speak mandarin; it would be best to follow the group very clean  efficient and accommodating  the eatery fits the bill  the host lead us to our table for six quickly  our lead says she's been here several times so  due to our time constraints  pointed us out to the noodle soup entrees the shop is known for their soup dumplings which they make fresh on the premises   i and three others promptly chose the seafood soup while the remaining three picked pork chop soup and tofu  moments later  our waiter served six massive bowls of noodle soup in quick succession  i mean you could  feed the 82nd airborne and a small afghan village  the soup based was quite tasty  light broth with undertones of garlic  shallots and oyster  noodles mingled with large pieces of fish balls  squid  surimi and shrimp  quite filling  lunch accomplished parking is available with the municipal lot across the street  the 7 train is a block away while the major flushing busses terminates nearby 
i will happily take the 7 train to come eat here  happily  i'm even willing to take the local train  i will not complain that it takes an hour or so  i will not complain that some of the stations are outdoors  therefore when the door opens  a gust of cold wind blows into the train  i will not complain because i have found a new love  nan shian  not only do you satisfy my dumpling cravings  i was surprised and delighted to find some very authentic taiwanese breakfast items on the menu  needless to say  on that particular afternoon  i forced my dining companion to consume about half the menu items with me  ) entirely worth the less than $30 total  and the insane food coma afterwards
my 4 star rating is purely for the soup dumplings only   a lighter soup dumpling compared to joe shanghai (which i still adore) both a very good dumpling in my opinion  although the soup was light it was still  very flavorful  i was able to eat more dumplings here than  at joe's  the portions are considered small here  they only serve 6 dumplings per order vs joe's @ 8pcs per order (i didn't check the price comparison)  our noodles came in big plates with little noodles  so i guess if you come with one or two other people the portions are fine  any more and you will need to order extra dishes (btw i'm a pretty big eater)  i suggest not to order the scallion pancake  it was fried flour with zero  scallions   no flavor at all  the fried noodles  shanghainese udon noodles   pan stir fried rice cakes  fried dumpling all very mediocre  decent enough to order so your dinner does not only consist of soup dumplings   service   typical asian to asian service    we asked for the menu to add dishes to our meal (since the dishes were small) the waitress rolled her eyes at us  lol    i'm chinese so i am use to this sort of rude behavior at asian restaurants  ofc i won't say anything to them during the meal because i definitely do not want to find extra "ingredients" in my dishes  i kept my mouth shut last night  but i definitely had to yelp about it sooo    come here for the soup dumplings period 
solid dumpling house  very good soupy dumps  everything was hot  fresh  flavorful  and well made  only con i can think of is that the shao mai were kinda weird 
seriously this is my favorite restaurant in all of queens  i am particularly fond of the turnip puff pastries and of course  the soup dumplings  unlike other soup dumplings  you won't be feeling full o pork fat when you leave 
after the temple  we decided a couple of hours' rest was required by our stomachs   after walking around flushing mall and perusing multiple knicknacks  we finally made our last stop  nan shian dumpling house there were some people on line in front of us  and we were all fixated on the table by the glass between the sitting interior and glassed off passageway where we were waiting   two little girls were poking holes in their soup dumplings  making puddles on their dishes  before finally munching on the dumplings   then  there was the stir fried udon looking wonderfully greasy with brown sauce slicking it all   really  i don't know how we could have been even thinking of more food  but watching those little girls  i wanted those soup dumplings after all when we gave our order for one serving of the dumplings  the waitress asked "one?"  after all  there were three of us   "yes  one "  "one?"  "yes  one "when the waitress finally agreed that we would be allowed to share one order of soup dumplings between the three of us  we continued a conversation that needed a conclusion  what is the correct way to hold chopsticks?  well  i know i don't hold my chopsticks correctly because my father told me so   only to be chastened when i pointed out that i held my chopsticks the same way he did   it turned out that two of us at the table hold our chopsticks the "incorrect" way with the back parts of our chopsticks crisscrossing while one held it the "correct" way in the manner shown on the chopstick wrapper   by the way  three asian women all using their chopsticks on invisible food does not inspire confidence in the serving staff at an asian restaurant  particularly in the manager who kept on glancing at us to see if we would go postal at any moment thankfully  the food arrived after we realized the weird looks we were getting  and we were able to use our chopsticks very delicately (both correctly and incorrectly) on the soup dumplings  making sure not to poke any unwanted holes   carefully chewing a hole at the top  we all took a sip of the broth   delicious   not too heavy  clear perfect broth piping hot   we slowly sipped the broth  savoring every bit of it before having just enough to chew on all the dumpling after our second dumpling each  we looked at each other and nodded   yes  the waitress was right   we really needed more than one order of dumplings   so  we got the crab soup dumplings in the midst of waiting for our crab soup dumplings  and more weird invisible food chopstick manuvers (it takes a look while for those dumplings to appear given that they are steamed only after the order is placed) i was thinking about a table i had watched while waiting   one of the guys had been soaking his fried long dough in hot soy milk   it looked so good   when i said so to my friends  one of them said "let's order it "  but when the waitress came over  she said  "can we look at the menu again "  that's how we ended up with the fried long dough  hot soy milk  and stir fried udon noodles   the fried long dough was fresh   so delicious with the hot soy milk   all of this cost us roughly $25 altogether   so  lessons learned 1) you really need more than one order of soup dumplings if there are three of you 2) if you wait on line and watch everyone eating  you will end up with more food than you thought possible to consume after a day of nothing but eating in flushing 3) do not discuss chopstick techniques on invisible foods at asian establishments 4) too much eating does not prevent happiness despite all the groaning 
as a person who was born in shanghai  i do not recommend the food here  they taste weird as shit  i ordered the xie fen xiao long bao  which means there would be crab in there  i are this thing in shanghai before  i knew there would be a lot of crabs in there  however  they did not have any crabs  when i asked them  they said it was just like that  and they charged more! it's supposed to be a shanghai restaurant  but all the cooks and waitresses here were from taiwan  as a result  do not go here 
this place is also known as nan xiang xiao long bao (which translated to nan shiang dumpling house) i came here recently with a friend and he had touted it as the best xiao long bao place ever   however  my experience was that it was not even as good as joe's shanghai   my friend claims that it was an unusual night   and that normally the xiao long bao is really good   my main issue with the baos that night was that they all busted at the bottom   that means they were not constructed well   xiao long baos should not explode at the bottom still  i love xiao long bao even when they are not top notch  and i also did enjoy our other dishes   the cold cucumbers with garlic  pan fried dumplings  and the mushrooms  pork and noodles   prices are cheap!  our whole meal was about $30   lines here are long  so go early!
best authentic xiao long bao in nyc    joe's shanghai has totally sold out to whitey at this point   sells them cheap overpriced garbage because they read about it in some crappy timeout review or something  while those in know stay away   keep it real and don't ever feel the need to cater to whitey 
love the soup dumplings and garlic noodles and cucumber with garlic and scallion what a feat and what a price!unbeatable   please note if you come any time after 6 pm you will be waiting   and the place is small so be prepared to wait outside as well !
what is that? you are addicted to soup dumplings and you want the breaking bad of all soup dumplings? you'll probably need to go to shanghai for that but until then  we have nan xiang dumpling house  this was one of the places i was wanting to go to when i visited nyc and sweet mother teresa on the hood of a mercedes bens this is some of the best soup dumplings i have ever had  the soup is divine and piping hot  every time i swing by nyc  this is definitely one place i will stop by forever 
food is good  but have to wait 40 minutes to one hour to get a table for a group of 3  maybe is because this place is too hot 
hands down the best soup dumplings in nyc area  no jokes  served and made fresh every day  you can even see the group of 3 middle aged ladies making them in the corner which imo makes them more boss  the crab and pork combo ones are fantastic  paired with some scallion pancakes (again the best in nyc) and fresh pan fried noodles  you cannot go wrong    ever 
great soup dumplings    def a little less greasy than joes shanghai   i liked the cold appetizers a lot too this place would've gotten 5 stars were it not for the shoddy service   management wasn't too pleasant  **reviews lead me to believe they accept credit cards  when we arrived  a sign on the door said no credit**all in all i will go back    more than a few times!
delicious authentic chinese food can't wait to go back
less oily  bigger in size  less msg after taste than joe shanghai or joe ginger! go before 6 pmif you're concerned about whether these soup dumplings were pre made and frozen   don't  they prepare them behind the low counter and is served fresh! and it's located right next to canton gourmet (best cantonese restaurant in flushing) for your quick fix rice and dungeness crab satisfaction 
some of the better xiao long bao in the nyc area   great value for the money 
if u are looking for something cheap and delicious  this is the place! i have been there many times and so far i like everything i have ordered  their soup dumping is the best! the place is always crowded but it's worth trying because it's authentic and yummy!!
four and a half stars for the food  unfortunately the service forces me to round down to just four  granted i'm used to the typical "chinese restaurant service" but it more of the speed that i have an issue at nan shian  about a 15 20 minute wait for a table and when you order the soup dumplings it takes almost another half an hour to 45 minuates for them to arrive! the reason why i gripe is that i see many people just sitting and waiting at their table for the food to arrive  not evening eating  it seems that they need to readjust their cooking schedule  if they are constantly making batches of the most popular items  that would reduce wait time significantly now onto the positives  when the food actually arrives  you are in for a treat! these are definitely the best soup dumplings in the area  flavorful hot broth and thin skin makes the wait worth it! if you are a soup dumpling noob  make sure to come with an experienced person to teach you the proper way to savor every drop and prevent you from burning your tongue  the shanghai fried udon is also really good here and highly recommended  just about everything here is better than the competition  not to mention cheaper   if you can head here during a weekday and avoid the wait  you will definitely enjoy it!
this place is known for their xiao long bao( soup dumplings) and the skin of the dumpling has good texture  everything else they sell  is mehhhhhh  my favorite part of eating here is actually watching the ladies behind the cashier make soup dumplings by hand  its fun to watch!
we were first going to the food court under the flushing mall which is bleh so it was a good surprise that my parents changed their minds to come here  clean place which is hard to find in chinese restaurants the cold dishes were pretty good  i especially like the sweet bean curd dish with mushrooms and bamboo shoots the xiao long bao were good too and i would say is on the same level as joe's shanghai in chinatown  the chao nian gao with pork was superb  but my ultimate favorite is the sweet soy bean milk with freshly fried you tiao  this pairing is seriously better than stuff i've had in taiwan 
came late on a friday morning  no line at all to wait  servers were polite  restaurant was clean and spacious with a rating scallion pancake with beef (around $5)  the scallion pancake  about the size of a ti 84 calculator  was very tasty  i would suggest getting it without the beef  as the beef was not all that tender and the beef+sauce detracted from the soft crispiness of the pancake  however  this is too expensive for the size!steamed pork dumplings aka xiao long bao (around $5)  i've never been much of a fan of xlb  but these were pretty good 
in love  i don't know what the "old" soup dumplings used to taste like  but i don't come here for the soup dumplings? crazy you say? just try their scallion oil noodles and fried rice cake with chicken  drool worthy good  i'm drooling just thinking about it right now  cold dishes are also very worthy investment  for $4  you can pick from a variety of dishes with my favorites being the fried gluten  crispy cucumbers  and garlicky seaweed carbohydrate heaven!
love this place! great steamed vegetable dumplings and soybean tofu salad (with dry spiced tofu  scallions and chopped greens)  came here for lunch and savored each fabulous bite  love the soy souce with vinegar and shredded ginger dipping sauce! service is a bit gruff  but i was expecting that 
excellent dumplings! they taste different from joe shanghai 's   theirs are less oily  and more flavored 
i think i actually like this place more than joe's shanghai  it seems like the food is more authentic  just because of the crowd  i've been to joe's shanghai twice  the one in flushing and the one in chinatown  and i still prefer nan shian dumpling house  because joe's shanghai seems very americanized  just my opinion  if you come to nan shian dumpling house  you need to definitely get their xia long baos! they are so good  with a lot of soup inside  we got the pork and crab one  the crab one had the crab taste  and it actually had crab pieces in it  both types are phenomenal  the best way to eat it is to place one bao carefully into the soup spoon  then bite off a tiny piece of the bao  sip the soup slowly and savor it  i like to put the soy sauce dip into my bao by using a small spoon  the sauce is vinegary  so some people might not like it  after sipping the soup  i put the whole bao in my mouth and chew! so very delicious  i went with a friend and all we ordered were the pork and crab baos  this pork noodle soup  and this fried dough that many people eat with congee  a type of rice porridge  i prefer this place over joe's because joe's soup seems very viscous  it's a bit thick for me  and everything was greasy  especially their noodles 
i hope this is the right one  but alls i gots to say is that we got the crab soup dumplings and it was delish  i know soup dumplings can get kind of oily and give you that sticky feeling on your lips  but still  it was the right amount of grease i think it was about $5 for 7 dumplings?totally an authentic  mando speaking restaurant  so you're getting real results in your food 
they serve the best xlb aka soup dumplings aka your favorite dumpling's favorite dumpling  #1 in the 5 boroughs for a long time
excellent xiao long bao  but all the other dishes i had were equally great  lots of small plates to choose from  tried their fried pork buns (kind of like shanghai version of cha siu bao)  their salty soy milk (not that salty which was good for me)  the cold jelly fish and cold spicy beef tripe appetizers  we also had a fried noodle dish with seafood  some of their other cold appetizers were not available today  came on a saturday morning at 11am and managed to get a table with minimal wait  but by the time we left  there was a small line  waiters speak mandarin  and are a little hurried   they forgot 1 of our dishes on the original order  but we told them to leave it off the bill  not many tables here  so would not come here with a big party  i would come again though because food was great 
thanks  fellow yelpers!  we never would have gone into this place   we're european americans who like chinese food  but don't know it well   this place didn't look any different from any other restaurant in flushing   but based on your recommendations  we went in   we are so happy we did!  the place was clean and the service was friendly   we had the noodles with scallion sauce  rice cakes with shredded pork and steamed pork buns   so good!  we were stuffed   for $22  including tip   we ate at way more expensive places on our weekend in new york  and all were good  but nan xiang is the one we'll remember 
we are here nearly every weekend during the from fall through spring time!  always ordering the same thing   2 orders of the soup dumplings  shanghai noodles and scallion pancakes for my daughter    and maybe additional 2 soup dumplings after we finish the 1st set the besting thing about this place is that it opens earlier  stroller friendly and now has taken over the restaurant next door!!  so the wait is not as long thanks for keeping full and a warm belly!!
better xiao long bao than joe's shanghai!  very good overall   prices are relatively cheap and the seating is nice and simple without feeling too crowded or loud the wrapper is thin and the soup seasoning is good  but both the meat and soup taste don't have enough of that rich umami taste that require very fresh ingredients 
best meal all week in nyc after eating some $400 plus meals  the soupy dumplings with their vinegar sauce are in perfect harmony  i just wish they had more varieties of soupy dumpling  also  we got the rice cakes with shredded chicken  really tasty  but i think the ratio of cake to chicken was a little out of balance in favor of the cheaper starch  the beef and scallion pancake    there are no words for how tasty 
went here the monday after july 4th so i expected this place to be crowded since most people have this day off  it was a 100 degrees outside and contrary to what someone said  they do have ac but it's just comfortable inside  maybe too hot for some dudes?and   i was right  luckily  me and my sister came around 10 45 and as soon as 11 00 rolled around  a long long line started to form  lucky us  i was craving xiao long bao and i hadn't had any since my trip to shanghai 2 years ago   and i am happy to report that i was satisfied!!the xiao long bao takes quite a long time to come out so order then asap! pork is best with the vinegar  and the crab pork combo are best with the ginger soy soy dipping sauce  if you order cold dishes  they come out in a jiffy because they're already made  caution  the main waitress is a mean grouchy lady  i speak some chinese but i am not fluent so i ended up ordering in english  she was very mean and i had to ask for water twice  which she never delivered  finally we asked another girl  i noticed with the chinese speaking patrons  she was a bit more courteous   try to avoid her    she's easy to spot ;)also if you're looking for hot steaming tea  don't count on it  they have the pot ready for you when you sit down  meaning it's a bit lukewarm 
the food is absolutely delicious  and prompt  as for the service  it could be a little better  i apologized for coming close to closing but the waiter was a tad rude constantly rushing us but the other staff members were really friendly  i recommend the beef with chili oil and the crabmeat and pork soup dumplings melt in your mouth 
had to wait 20mins for my steamed pork buns ($5 50 for 6) but overall  it was worth it ^ ^
this is my second time try the soup dumplings  it's still great  but the others dishes just soso 
nan shian has finally done something about the long wait to get inside   as of 2 13 10  they've opened up a second dining room in the space once occupied by a less interesting restaurant next door! this is a mixed blessing  though  because they haven't expanded the kitchen or  more importantly  the station where they create those wonderful soup dumplings  stopping in today for a late lunch  both rooms were full  but there wasn't a line at the door  upon ordering  my friend and i were told that there was a 45 minute wait for soup dumplings  we couldn't bear the thought of leaving  so got two orders and waited it out with an order of cold  braised tofu with veggies  and a perfectly seasoned bowl of pork & cabbage soup the dumplings  when they finally arrived  were unfortunately hit or miss  about half of them were flat with little or no broth inside  they were tasty  as always  but the consistency seemed to be an issue with other table's orders as well  we witnessed an argument between two waitresses and four of the women dumpling makers which almost turned physical  over the product that the dumpling girls were serving! it was surreal all in all  i'll chalk today's visit up to growing pains and will return  but unless they figure it out  my rating will drop significantly in the future 
this place was absolutely delicious! i enjoyed all the food from this place and it's michelin rated for 2009  2010  and 2011  i'm looking forward to 2012 as well  we had the soup dumplings and steamed vegetable dumplings which were both very fresh and delicious  joe shanghai has good dumplings but this place has awesome everything! i had the salty soy bean milk and the sweet soy bean tofu and that was amazing too    i had the scallion pancake with sliced beef  which was sooo delicious! i highly recommend this place 
first introduction to xlb and this did not disappoint!  had the crab and pork soup dumplings which were as amazing as most reviewers say in addition to the shanghai udon noodles which were very tasty   great for the price and although the service isn't the best the food makes up for it 
the best xiao long bao (soup dumplings) i think i've ever had  piping hot  the skin is thin but spongy and the soup just pours out into your spoon to mix with the vinegar and ginger  i ate the whole order by myself and  based on my neighbors' plates  am very eager to return and try more dishes 
soup dumplings for the win! enough said   took about 30 mins to receive them but they were worth the wait  luckily the dumplings overcame the horrible service we received here   i'm all about the service    michelin rated but horrible service  in the words of arnold! " i'll be back!"
terrible service and food is not that splendid  we had to wait for 10 mins for a table for two and 20 mins for our soup buns  the server almost started a fight with some customers just because they thought the wait time is too long  i tried the shanghai wonton soup and the wonton is undercooked 
nanxiang xiaolongbao probably has the best xlb in new york  i honestly think joe's shanghai is a bit overrated  this place simply does not get enough credit  i'm not saying joe's shanghai is bad  but i feel like nanxiang is maybe on the same level as joes  we went for brunch on a sunday  and we ordered some lunch items and 2 steamers of xlb  what i like about nanxiang's xlb is that it's not as fatty as joes  but that's just my own personal preference  the xlb was extremely juicy and full of soup  now onto the other dishes  we didn't order much  because we were half full when we were invited to eat here  but we did order was super good  the jellyfish and the beef tripe we ordered were both perfect  so no complaints there  service was ok for chinatown  and this restaurant is also cash only 
the soup dumplings here were sooooooo goood  we had both the pork and the pork with crab   but found we preferred the pork on it's own  we'd never had rice cakes before and a nice couple next to us recommended them  they were delicious but not what we expected  as an american when i hear rice cakes  i think of quakers crunchy rice cakes  but these looked like water chestnuts and were gelatinous in a good way  the brown sauce was so tasty  we also saw some fried u don noodles that looked to die for  we highly recommend this place  but be prepared for family style seating and a line  worth the wait  the flavors were an explosion of savory comfort  well worth the trip to flushing
they have the best soup dumplings here  both the pork and crab meat are good  the pan fried noodle with beef is pretty good  it's extremely busy on weekends so try going on weekdays when it's less crowded and no wait 
so good  oh so good!  this place rocks my socks   the portions are large  so large that 4 people can share 2 entrees and be satisfied   the dumplings were amazing   our party was silent while eating for about 15 minutes straight   now that is saying something!
the steamed crab meat and pork buns (xiao long bao) were decent  but please do not get the scallion pancake  one  there were no scallions  two  they were deep fried  should be renamed deep fried dough  also  do not get the pork and vegetable wontons in spicy sauce  it's not done at all in the szechuan style  it is basically hard dumplings in peanut sauce with a hint of spiciness  i would come back for the xiao long bao only and try the pork fried pork buns and the fried rice cake 
just like everyone else has already stated  best xia long bao in ny   perhaps the world  upon arrival  we immediately ordered the soup dumplings and ignored everything else  the dumplings were made fresh by a lady near the register and came out steaming hot  the soup inside the dumplings was so delicious that we ended up licking it off our plates (yeah that good)  for 5 50 a serving it was fairly priced considering they are the best i've ever had  oh yeah be careful of how hot they can be and make sure not to spill any soup!!
we got some other stuff aside from soup dumplings    it was ok    (the other dishes) but we def  devoured the soup dumplings  i like how the soup in the dumplings are not super thick  and the meat was a good amount and tasty  had spicy wontons     it was ok  the soy milk came in a large bowl     not expecting it    but it was so great! lol we drank it from a spoon  nomnomnomn slurpslurp!
this is my first yelp review ever! i never felt the need to write something until i had the scallion pancake wrapped beef this weekend! it was phenomenal! the scallion pancake was nice and crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle  the perfect consistency! it was as if they added some mochi to it! we also ordered the crab soup dumplings  shanghai stir fried noodles  spicy beef and tripe dish  salty radish bun thingy  and the red bean flavored ones  everything was pretty good  the wait time was a fraction of the wait time compared to joe shanghai's in chinatown  i feel like i will definitely need to go out of my way to make a trip to flushing every time i'm in nyc!
great place for dim sum! especially for soup dumplings!
it's not joe's!it's not bad but it ain't joe's  and that's joe's in flushing  not joe's in ctown and definitely not joe's in midtown food taste healthier = bland  jellyfish app was a joke  they need to rename that shit to radish with jellyfish  not acceptable  took them 20 minutes to make some fried pork buns while the head chef taught two others how to wrap them  not acceptable  the scallion pancakes were much too thick and chewy  not acceptable  only 6 soup dumplings per basket for same price as joe's  not acceptable 
nice   3 times in a week is sure going to get my attention for a review   brag by other that this is the best dumpling  we came here while some visitors wanted to eat in flushing  with our normal food craw  this is our first stop  and honestly; the dumpling has thin skin but it was ok for me  it wasn't the xiao long bao that got my attention but the crispy donut with sweet soybean milk    i was starving crazy at the table that was eating and don't know why i did not order my own  but reminisces on my childhood memory   lol    we then left to another location  then my reality came back and i requested to go back few hour later to have that for dessert  lol    i know  silly me; but i finally ate it and i was very very happy   although very full from the day of food craw    i came back here another time later the week just to eat it again  but this time w  the salty soymilk  and so so not recommend   ewllllllllll     stay with the sweet soy and crispy donut   i really enjoy it!
this is one of the best restaurants ever  and so affordable  my husband and i get the cucumber garlic salad  the scallion pancake (so good)  and two orders of soup dumplings (they call them "pork buns" on the menu  if you're reading in english)   i also got the spicy beef noodle soup once  which was incredible  worth a trip to flushing  but get there on the early side to avoid lines 
review is only for the pancake with sliced beef which is excellent   i really enjoyed the fried crispy ness of the pancake along with the sauce bean paste sauce smothered on tasty sliced beef   tip  you gotta eat it quick!
don't go there when it's the lunch or dinner time because you must be in line  food is okay but reminds me of thinking of my homeland  
do not  i repeat  do not  order from this place over the phone i was in the neighborhood (a likely story) craving the soup dumplings  i called and the line was choppy (first bad omen)  then the chinese english shouting match ensued  i managed to get the words "shanghai steamed pork bun" and "scallion pancake" out  ten minutes ten minutes later im there  and its another 10  then i see the receipt  shanghai pan fried udon and scallion pancake  im thinking two things  didn't i say pork bun  and isn't udon japanese?great place  but they need to improve their phone connection and communication 
this place is just as good  if not better than joe shanghai  which is one of the best xiao long bao places in the united states   the soup dumplings here were very solid   a great texture to the skin  and a very flavorful soup that was complemented by the typical vinegar and ginger blend   i think  6 xiao long baos came with each order  which was only about $5 50 per order   also got the noodles  the scallion pancakes with beef  and the rice cakes   all were great   dinner for a party of 6 was about $15 per person with a bottle of beer per person   good times only negative is that the place is tiny  so you will likely have to wait for a seat   going as a pair is the best way to get a seat  but we had 6 people and they were able to accommodate us   i think anything over 6 people might be more difficult  and probably not recommended 
we seriously don't think this is the best place to represent the steamed pork soup dumplings  we went there out of curiosity  the dumplings were not flavorful and the meat was processed roughly  we also ordered the stir fry shredded pork rice cake  the result was the same  tons of rice cake but barely any meat or veggies in the dish and it was really greasy  the couple next to us ordered the shredded pork noodle soup and he was complaining he can't find any pork in his noodle soup besides the broth  if this restaurant is in taiwan today  i bet you no one give them such high rating 
i visited this place on a culinary expedition with a friend of mine who recently moved back to nyc after 3 years living in beijing   our quest   to find the perfect dumpling   we did succeed  but not at this particular establishment  their soup dumplings were very good  maybe even worth returning for   however  the pan fried pork dumplings were not   the meat really wasn't very good   it reminded me of hot dogs  too much salt  not enough flavor   also  the garlic cucumber was not as crisp as it should have been 
crab and pork buns  seaweed with garlic and crispy noodles with shredded pork all rocked  busy joint  simple with no frills  just good good food 
yummy xiao long baos  the skin wrap were nice and thin  the soup was good  it's hard to find xiao long bao with thin skin and good soup  we also ordered scallion pancakes but it wasn't good  pancakes were not crispy and not much of a taste  pancakes were lacking of scallions i can't wait to go back  the only problem is that flushing is a little too far for me 
i swear i'm no food snob but if you want the best dumplings come here delicious scallion pancakes and crispy noodles  every chicken dish here is amazing  every soup dish here is amazing i just hate the wait for a table on the weekends so i recommend getting here a little early  before they get too crowded 
my favorite breakfast place in nyc  xiaolongbao is awesome  you can see the juice in the baozi  their youtiao is also very good 
the food is ok  just ok   but the service is really bad! don't know why it's cash only and they don't have a sign in the entrance! and the dumpling dough is not even close to what it should be  again  service is no good! the waiters are just  friggin rude!
i had a prescription for a zpak and the place was empty when i tried to fill it  the girl said it would be 15 minutes  i broused around the place and after 25 minutes was told that there was an insurance problem  the pharmacist told me only i could settle it by contacting my benefits coordinator  i emphatically told her that nothing should be wrong and she replied with "if this is what my computer is saying  it must be true  if you don't believe it  go somewhere else"  so i took my script and left since i wasn't going to pay out of my pocket  i went to another pharmacy right afterwards with the same prescription  after only 5 minutes waiting  the pharmacist said "you're ll ready sir  there was an insurance issue but all i had to was call them and it fixed the problem  i realized that if that first pharmacist at skyline just made a small effort  could've delivered the same good service as this other pharmacy  2 thumbs way down for skyline!
best soup dumplings around and arguably some of the best dumplings i've ever had  place is a little daunting for the not super adventurous but it's worth it  parking and the wait aside the place is nicely setup and clean  soup dumplings and fried dumplings were both exceptional  you can see these fluffy concoctions being made right in front of you  udon looks great but i didn't try it  turnip cake and scallion pancake were the surprises of the trip  definitely roll 
i have starting coming earlier and earlier in the morning to avoid the crowds  unfortunately ppl think the same way  service has increasingly become more and more abrupt and mechanical  the food has suffered   the dough is no longer translucent but thick becoming hard after cooling  other dishes are greasy and inconsistent  i think i'll wait until i go to toronto or hk for ding tai fung 
man  it sucks to be a korean american chick living in flushing chinatown sometimes  because everybody assumes i'm a chinese mute who can't speak or understand chinese  and eating in at nan shian dumpling house was no exception  i was chastised numerous times for "not listening" by the waitresses (according to my chinese friend who i ate dinner with tonight) as customers needed to get through the cramped quarters  despite the inevitable  but no less annoying  ethno linguistic barrier  i enjoyed the steamed pork soup dumplings  it had great flavor  and the soup part was delicious! i preferred the dumplings without the soy sauce vinegar ginger mix  because i found the latter to be rather acidic for my taste  but i think i'll like it more as i eat more soup dumplings  it's only a matter of time  as for the kill (the meaty center)  i found it to be of a factory made texture i associate when my mom cooks dumplings from a package  which isn't totally bad  it was good enough  but not phenomenal  i also got to try my friend's crispy noodles with beef  which was greasy but decent  i'm willing to go here again  and see if it really is worth all the hype and accolade the dumpling house gets  so far  i'm keeping an open mind and hope to visit this place again soon 
i thought this place was good   their dumplings definitely rival that of joe shanghai (flushing!)   i thought their rice cakes were good as well   their sour cabbage with pork noodle soup was quite bland though   i think shanghai cafe has definitely got on up in this department   i also ordered the "hong you chao shou "  which i'm not sure of what the english name would be   it's basically wonton in a sesame spicy sauce rather than in soup   i thought the sauce was severely lacking   the wonton was a bit bland as well   if you come here  just stick to the soup dumplings with pork and crabmeat and the stir fry rice cakes 
the best soup dumplings i've ever had  very nice people working here too and lots of families enjoying dinner 
i found this place on yelp from all the raving reviews  we are staying in manhattan  visiting from la  we have eaten at joe's several times and this place is not any better than joe's shanghai nyc  at both places we  shared a table with other patrons  at least at at joes the tables were round and there was plenty of room at the table for the food  the rectangular table top for 2 was tiny here so the restaurant used petite size steamer baskets  this was the crucial mistake for xiao long baos because the dumplings were stuck together as a result of expansion after steaming  there was no ample space between dumplings in the basket  at joes the baskets were larger and even larger yet at the arcadia din tai fung   picking up the dumplings without breakage was difficult  juiceless dumplings were a disappointment  din tai fung has the juiciest dumplings with the thinnest skin from a technical merit this place is behind joe's  why even gamble when the odds are bad on the leaky dumplings  the taste of the dumplings were similar to joe's  the price is cheaper here but not worth the 1 1 2 hr round trip from nyc to flushing beef noodle soup here was worse than joes and joes was pretty bad too  you new yorkers need to add some spices  cloves and the 5 spice for some flavor! both places the noodle were over cooked  and soggy  both broths lack cloves and the five spice flavor  dings at rowland heights ca has the best beef noodle soup  din tai fung also has better than average beef noodle soup but the price is steep  stirred fried shanghai style udon here was too dry and lacked the old soy sauce flavor the cabbage a little carrot and again flavor!  it was definitely better at joe's  ding's noodles in rowland heights  ca has the best shanghai udon the beef pancake was by far the best here than any other places i have eaten  i highly recommend this over other dishes  xiao long baos was good but i doubt you would have 100% success without any breakage if you are traveling in nyc then it is not worth your time  joe's shanghai in chinatown is definitely better even if the bill is 10% more expensive 
definitely one of the better xiaolongbaos i've had in new york  the crab and pork xiaolongbao was more flavorful than the standard pork dumpling  lots of juice so be careful when eating!the shengjianbaos were awful which is why they didn't get 5 stars  the meat was bland and dry with no soup at all in the dumpling  the dough was also really thick which seems to be a trend for shengjianbaos in ny    stick with the xiaolongbaos!
arrived at the crack of dawn after dropping my sister off for a flight  i was the first one in the restaurant for xlb and was thrilled  finally  a place that steams the wrappers properly  the dough didn't stick to my lips unlike every other soup dumpling i've had on this coast  and i was in heaven  the pan fried dumplings and shui mai were also super delicious  can't wait to go back 
i've came to this restaurant quite a few time already and i've immensely enjoy their soup dumplings every time  today was one of those days where had a craving for some dumpling and figured this would be the perfect place to satisfy me  also  my friend cynthia a  still haven't tried their soup dumpling but has been in that restaurant for noodle soups which took me by surprised  i thought the fact that behind a glass panel you'll noticed that its main attraction would be the dumpling seeing there are a few women there making the dumplings completely visible as well as those bamboo steamers  i think the waiting staff have been more accommodating for westerners as their english seems to improved compared to how it was a few years ago (or at least i think so)  note  i can scarf down 2 orders of crabs soup dumplings and then a noodle soup for just lunch  my favorite noodle soup would be the beef  also  i love the breakfast style food they have like the soy milk (hot cold) with the pancakes with beef and eggs  i'm getting hungry as i speak of their menu   i should stop right about       now 
b  and i made our second trip to flushing tonight for a date of soup dumplings since our last trip was ill fated (as previously reviewed)   nan shian dumpling house is all about the dumplings   the menu is fairly limited beyond the apps and noodle soups   we ordered the rice cakes with shredded pork (fabulous) and the crispy noodles with beef (beef chow mein  in other words)   the pork and rice cakes were fabulous we also ordered two orders of the pork crab soup dumplings which took a surprisingly long time to come out  but maybe that's because everyone else was ordering them too   i have read numerous reviews that claim these are the best soup dumplings in the city   i read an article in the nyt that said that these were the best soup dumplings *outside of china*   suffice it to say expectations were high they were good   but truthfully  i said in a whisper at our table  i think grand szechuan's are better   these are more crabby  and therefore less greasy   and that's a plus   but the dough was also doughier than i expected   they were good  quite good  just not as great as i'd hoped the pork and rice cakes  on the other hand  was tremendous 
most underrated soup dumplings in the city  big  juicy and cheap as hell  what more could you ask for? take the road less travelled  skip joe's shanghai and come here instead

omg  intense mouth and nose orgasms the whole meal   great spicey appetizers (we had the pig's ear and won ton in red sauce)  literally perfect xiao long baos that is as beautiful as they are tasty  and a whole inventory of amazing staples such as scallion cakes  dumplings and beef noodle soup   literally the best chinese food i've head in ages   i left feeling spiritually fulfilled  not a easy feat (since i have been told to have a hollow soul) 
the dumplings are good and all but our waitress wouldn't come over to take our order for about fifteen minutes  she did once come by our table but as soon as we started ordering she turned right back around and left  when we finally flagged her down to order the soup dumplings  she got a little upset and lectured us because we hadn't ordered quickly enough  we would have if she had come to take our order  we also specifically ordered one ice water  didn't get it  reminded the waitress and got lukewarm water with no ice  which is not a big deal except everyone around us had glasses of water with ice in them  it felt weird i understand it's a busy place and i don't fault the staff for getting crabby by the end of a long sunday on their feet  but it did feel like she was blowing us off a little bit more than is acceptable if you are going during the weekend  expect a wait on line  it's a small place with a large following so it's understandable  and there seems to be pretty quick turnover of the tables oh yes but the soup dumplings were excellent 
4 5 stars the first thing you're greeted by as you approach this restaurant is a line out the door and a completely packed restaurant  on the windows  you can see its many accolades  zagat rated  michelin guide recommended  praised by nyt  etc original pork xiaolongbao  you get 6 for $6  so a bit pricer than other places  but you're paying for quality  you can see the cooks fold  pinch  and steam your xiaolongbao right after you order  about 10 15 minutes later  nom nom  the xiaolongbao is served steaming hot with a bed of nappa cabbage underneath and a dish of chinkiang vinegar (black vinegar) mixed with soy sauce and shredded pickled fresh ginger  the dumpling skin is very thin  so it takes some chopstick skills to pick up your xiaolongbao without poking a hole in the skin and having all the soup pour out  i like to just plop the whole thing in my mouth  have the delicious flavorful broth pour out  and enjoy the gingery pork intermingle with all of the other flavors  i also drink some of the soy vinegar ginger dipping sauce straight while i'm eating the xiaolongbao to add some acidity  eating good xiaolongbao like this is a transcendent experience  damn  i'm salivating just thinking about it  decor is nothing special and neither is service  but this restaurant clearly didn't achieve its cult status by being pretty or nice  it serves up phenomenal xiaolongbao that satisfies even the native chinese population in flushing  highly recommend  especially for 1st time xiaolongbao eaters 
i like joe's shanghai in manhattan  but yelpers did not seem to think the flushing location was as good and rated nan shian higher for their soup dumpling  so i went the experience was disappointing   of course i was not expecting great service  but they were just completely unattentive   i waited in line for 20 minutes  only to be skipped over when some guy walks in  speaks chinese to the waitress and is seated right away   what   come on!!!then i order the soup dumplings and again i'm ignored for at least 30 minutes   i ask the waiter to check on my order and he says it's coming up   i see that the waitress again skips me  and serve dumplings to at least 3 tables who were seated after me; i'm furious   the waiter finally sees that i'm getting impatient and he says my dumplings will be up in one minute   it comes  but i can't even enjoy it anymore i love hole in the wall places  and don't expect much in terms of wait service  but nan shian was just ridiculous the soup dumpling tasted fine  but not the best i've had 
i finally found a xiao long bao comparable to shanghai cafe deluxe (mott st   chinatown ) while nan xiang and shanghai cafe are very similar  i noticed that nan xiang's had more and tastier liquid inside  the crab dumplings were way less 'crabby' than shanghai cafe and i'm not sure thats a good thing  still  they were tasty and satisfying  i like the skin better at shanghai cafe and because i live closer to chinatown i eat there more often  but whenever i'm in flushing i make sure to stop here! either way both places are way better than joe's shanghai!!!
my wife and i stopped by finally to see what the big deal was   don't believe the hype about their xiao long bao first  i *love* xiao long bao   i've been to toronto  shanghai  and of course nyc   i can speak with some reasonable authority of what makes a good xiao long bao   i roll my eyes when i see a newbie mangle the poor little dumpling   i cringe when i see chopsticks being wielded like they're two pronged forks or wooden mini fork lifts   like the yin and the yang  xiao long bao requires both finesse and boldness  perfectly balanced  in the way they are made and the way they should be eaten the dumpling skin must be delicate  not too thick  not too thin   nan shian's is very delicate  almost perfect   i give them high marks   there is plenty of soup inside and they get good marks for that  as well   in technical execution  they are near perfect where do they fall short?  the flavor   oh  how disappointing   the soup is rather bland   that is the xiao long bao's big payoff   the skin should burst into a rich explosion of flavor the moment it is gently punctured by my teeth   instead  it was only so so  what was left then was the meat filling  which was a tad small and lacked much taste at all  even the crab filling  which is the better of the two choices offered even then  i'd give the xiao long bao 4 stars because what they do is extremely difficult to execute   but they they lost a star because of poor service  long waits  and frankly  a better alternative only a few blocks away   yes  joe's shanghai is nearby  and comparison is inevitable   while their xiao long bao has its critics  too  i find them superior in flavor and a better value (for about the same price  you get 8  not 6)   wait can be bad at both places  but at joe's  once seated  those juicy gems arrive quickly   not at nan shian   you may have to wait 20 45 minutes for a table  and then wait as much again for the dumplings to arrive we'll not likely go back there until the hype is over  and then only to see if anything has changed   until then  i'll see you at joe's 
although i really like the little cold dishes that they have especially the seaweed  i thought their pork buns where ok  i think that joes shanghi's carb pork buns are more flavorful  but this place definitely had great seafood crispy noodles and the cold dishes were great and home made  this is a small place  good for a small group but i think it might be a little crowded for a group of 6 or more  be sure not to be too hungry if you are going on a weekend the weight might be 20 minutes for a party of 2 
the dumplings and noodles are top notch and dirt cheap  that's what i come here for  and that's pretty much all there is on the menu  can't come too often  though  because it gets boring fast 
the pan fried version of the soup dumplings are good however the regular soup dumplings here are also good but i am a joe's shanghai fan  a lot more variety also at joe's 
it's so crowded  noone goes there anymore     it's cramped  you will share tables and they try to turnover fast   go there off peak hours  brunch on a weekday  maybe?   they have breakfast foods   good xiaolongbao (hot soup buns or soup dumplings)  one of the better ones around  decent cold bar  including good  (kaofu) or baked braised wheat gluten   stir fried rice cakes (niangao) were meh   not bad  but not great   kind of confused with the signs  since it says northern chinese but they serve lots of shanghai dishes 
i used to only get soup dumplings (xiao long bao) from no  1 east [yelp com biz no 1 east f… but i think i will come here from now on! these are great  perfectly juicy and flavorful  i also ordered a delicious bowl of seafood noodles   and i have to say  it was the best seafood noodle soup i've had in flushing  flaky chunks of fish  tender squid  scallops and fresh noodles  loved it here and will be back! ps   i braced myself for a long wait (even brought a book with me to pass the time!)  but it wasn't bad at all!
i've been here many times and it was always good  i'm usually the only non asian and go with my wife [chinese] and she does the ordering  dumplings are imo as good or better than joe shanghai's and are priced cheaper 
holy economical dinner  batman  that might be the best dollar for dollar dinner i have had in new york  four of us are stuffed and the total was $31 50! dumplings were fantastic  make sure you get them  and the cucumbers appetizer were vinegary delicious  i will definitely come again 
i came here twice so far (in the same month)  i'm always trying out new places  so if i go somewhere more than once around the same time frame  that's usually a big deal for me let me start by saying  i am obsessed  obsessed (!!!) with xiao long baos  when i read about how superior nan xiang dumpling house's xlbs were to the other restaurants  i definitely had to make a trip there  i ordered the cold sweet soybean milk (this brought back childhood memories where i used to drink bottles of these)  scallion pancakes with beef  xlbs  and fried pork buns  the scallion pancakes with beef were savory  it tasted like peking duck in a deep fried dough  let's just say that i ate 2 3rds of this    then came the xlbs  oh my goodness  this is the best xlb i've ever had! the skin was thin and it was filled with so much broth (the best part)  my boyfriend was a novice at eating it  so he shoved the whole thing in his mouth  he wasn't happy when the broth burned his mouth and throat though; so be careful  that thing is steaming hot  what i do is  i nibble on the side of it and sip on the broth (but don't forget to add the vinegary soy sauce concoction that they give you)  then i devour the whole thing the pork buns were okay   not as good as the xlbs if you can't tell  i will definitely be making my third trip here soon 
the dumplings (xiao long bao) were good  particularly the ones with crab and pork  the other menu items were actually better  the red bean puffs were really quite nice  and the onion pancake was better than average  overall  the food was quite good  but the service was really quite slow  we were finished with a whole pot of tea (two people) before we even got the appetizers  if the food was as prompt as the flavors were good  i would be here often  instead  i was just watching other people enjoy their food while i sat hungry along side them in a crowded room food presentation is decidedly simple  but the food they serve is not meant to be extremely colorful and the decor is no worse than other excellent chinese fare  there was a big sign in the door about allergies posted  in the restaurant  possibly about the peanuts in the food  it was posted only in spanish for the clientele who were conspicuously absent 
went here last week  wasn't impressed  quality has definitely declined  oh well  on to the next one 
delicious xiao long baos  the best part of the experience is that they make your dumplings to order  meaning they don't start rolling the meat into the dough until you order  nothing is pre made or pre frozen  it was full of soup  the dough was decently thin and the meat was tasty we also tried the green onion pancake with beef (pretty good) and the shanghai noodle with pork (pretty good  but a little heavy on the vinegar side  the other food was pretty good  but the dumplings were definitely the major act  i would get some other food other than dumplings though to add some variety into the meal we waited almost 45 minutes  but it was totally worth it  just make sure you go inside and take a number from the hostess and stand where you can hear them call your number  if you wait outside  they might call your number and you'll miss it 
came here with my best friend to try the soup dumplings because we're both obessed! i liked that it was clean (which is rare in flushing) and that the space was big so we didn't have to wait for a table  however  i feel that the soup dumplings at joe's shanghai are tastier and a better deal  they give you more for about the same price  the ones here are a little bland    and i had to wait 20 minutes for them to come out  service was also not that great  towards the end of our meal we felt like we were being rushed out because more and more people had arrived 
nan shian is easy to miss  located on prince street  it looks almost identical to the other cantonese  malaysian  and taiwanese restaurants on the block  making it even more elusive is the fact that is has no english sign  yet  even if you can't read chinese  this is a restaurant you do not want to pass by  its fairly easy to identify nan shian  not only by sight but also by smell  simply walk in and take a glance at the tables  on nearly every table you'll find a bamboo steamer filled with six plump  seemingly over inflated dumplings and the smell of vinegar in the air  these juicy little treasures  filled with pork or crab meat and savory  fatty  fatty soup  are the reason why people flock to nan shian come with a big appetite and you can't go wrong  though there is often a wait for a seat in this tiny restaurant  the line moves quickly so you shouldn't have to wait long  beware the warm  humid days when the door is left open  because of a wind tunnel and poor ventilation  the "sweet" stench of stinky tofu floats in from the next door restaurant which  for me  is rather unpleasant  the good news is that the smell is completely absent inside nan shian    just step a little closer to the dining area and you should be ok!order your dumplings as soon as you sit down as each steamer will take almost twenty minutes to prepare  fear not  however  if you are especially hungry  while you may have to play the waiting game for the dumplings  the other dishes come out in literally minutes  because i am a creature of habit  i always order the panfried noodles or ricecakes  my 2nd favorite dish at any shanghainese joint that never  ever fails me  you won't have too much of a problem ordering because the menu is pretty short  with less than forty choices of noodle soups  stirfried noodles  appetizers  and ricecakes  smile and order freely since everything is cheap   nearly everything  including noodle dishes  is below $7 or $8!when your dumplings finally come  don't let them cool off too much  be careful not to burn yourself from the steam or the hot soup   there's a lot in these oversized suckers! make sure to add a tiny spoonful of the soysauce vinegar once you bite off the top   the contrast in flavors will improve the taste immensely!(edit   08 2010  i'm a little lazy to update my review  but since they expanded  i have to admit the quality of food has suffered  food is no longer transcendent  in fact  its sometimes kind of offensive  the egg scallion pancake was bland  the dumpling skins were not as delicate  and the stirfried noodles were charred and tasted like the wok hadn't been cleaned in years  the pacing of the food was awkward and service was slow  at least    its still cheap 
i tried nan shian on a recommendation from a colleague  and he  like many yelpers  compared the soup dumplings at nan shian to those at joe's shanghai and said "there's no comparison " were they better at nan shian? yes  but i think it's a bit of a mischaracterization to call what they serve at pell st  joe's "garbage " nan shian's xiao long bao were certainly a little more delicate  the soup a little tastier  the meat more succulent  i would return to nan shian and get them again  and i don't live anywhere near flushing the seafood noodle soup had some of the most tender squid and scallops i've ever tasted  so that was a pretty memorable dish  i thought the noodles were great too the scallion pancake with shredded beef was good  the shredded pork with rice cakes was good 
normally when i visit nyc  i try to stay at a hotel in manhattan but this time around i decided not to break the bank and live in flushing instead  first of all  downtown flushing is overcrowded with dim sum and dumpling restaurants so it is easy to eat at one that represents   fail  but not nan shian dumpling house! i'm going to be honest here   the servers are not the friendliest people you've ever met  the restaurant itself is tiny and the wait can be painful  but  all that frustration melts away when you take your first bite  or should i say take the sip off of your xiao long bao  clearly they have to be #*(&@#*( amazing for every yelp review to have mentioned them  seriously  i've been to china  i've eaten on  the streets of taiwan   this really is what xiao long bao is all about  the meat is juicy with flavor not oil  once you are done orgasming over that little delicacy  some other delicious things to eat would include   cool cucumbers from the appetizers  wontons in a very spicy sauce and the fried dough  so ok  i accept  fried dough never tastes bad  but when its not dripping in oil and comes out fresh and warm (not reheated  ew)   it deserves a shout out on a side note  because its such a small place  you are more than likely to be seated at a shared table  we were seated in the middle of a table for 6  and while our food kept us more than happy  i can easily say i could've done without the cross table conversation people were having over my head 
this place was always crowded  but they expanded the floor  it becomes as double as it was  soup dumpling is always juicy and good  don't burn your tongue  they steam your dumpling right after your order  when they are crowded  you may have to wait a little longer of course  that's worth it  i also like vegetable noodle soup  even though they constructed their floor  they do not change the price of food  that is what many people appreciate 
service comes with attitude but you come here for the soup dumplings because it's too expensive at joe's shanghai  a weird dish they serve is the beef noodle soup which instead of chunks of beef meat  it comes with shredded beef 
i don't wish to waste any more time on this place  since i can't get the hour and a half back that i spent waiting for greasy noodles and bland soup dumplings   don't believe the hype!
one of my all time favorite spots in flushing  do yourself a favor and get the pork soup dumplings  scallion pancake with beef and either the pan fried udon or the crispy noodles  it *will* be the best decision you make all month 
wow!!  update necessary!  so i have left the good ole' us of a for a little bit (coming on 2 years now) and when i came home for a short vaca  i knew i needed to eat at nan xiang again (duh)so much has changed!they now have a menu in english! and chinese  but we all knew that one alreadyadditionally  theyve expanded the restaurant and opened up next door too! woo! that means more seating and more dumplings for alljoy and happiness swept me over to know i didnt have to wait outside in the wet black slush while staring enviously at diners all whilst waiting for my name on the queue to come up!those days are over!expansion = good!final note on the changes  that means two bathrooms! additionally  the restaurant had lots of servers  so you'll never go around waving your hand trying to desperately get someone's attention to order or help again! woot!and then again  so little has changed  their dumplings are divine as i stated earlier  i have been abroad  more specifically  living in taiwan  taiwan  the home of the only soupy xiao long bao dumpling restaurant to have received a michelin fancy pants star  din tai fong  and i say  nan xian's soupy dumplings are of equal or even better quality  yum scrum dili umptiousand please dont forget to give the soy (both salty and sweet) a try!
truly terrible service today   we were a party of 2   the wait wasn't bad   we were seated in 5 minutes  but their waitstaff is rude and inattentive   took forever to take our order and no one came to refill our teacups   their food isn't as good as it used to be either   the soup dumplings took half an hour to arrive and they weren't even hot   inexcusable   they don't seem to have a handle on the restaurant since their expansion 
wow this is the real stuff  as good as taiwan!!!  probably the first place i've been to in flushing that i would be willing to trek the hour from manhttan to go back to 
the wait can get quite long   its a hit or miss  i have waited 10 mins one day and 30 another    crab steam dumpling are pretty good   a variety of noodles   fried or soup   some of the items are salty but overall good   the scallion pancakes with and without beed are a kid's favorite   soy bean drink hot or cool!
kinda gotten worst since the beginning  the soup in the xiao long baos aren't as good as they used to be 
best soup dumplings i ever had!! super affordable too   but there is a wait most of the time  even 3 4pm on a regular weekday  worth the wait tho ^^
absolutely one of the best soup dumplings in nyc  been there the 3rd time & love the pork and crab dumplings  eating there makes your taste buds feel so happy  great appetizers and noodles filled the stomach well 
i'm a noobie when it comes to soup dumplings but they were outstanding  first of all i like soup and i like dumplings it's like lamb and tuna fish!
the "xiao long bao" was pretty good   the beef rice cake was so so  i've had better   the other small dishes we had were decent   just go for the "xiao long bao"   the tab was very decent  about 14 per person  and we ended up extremely full   only thing was that they didn't really seat us  we just choose our own table   this could good or bad depending on how you look at it 
the soup dumplings were really great  i also like pan fried dumplings and those were ok   not bad mind you  but nothing to write home about  am i writing home?the shanghai noodles were also in the not bad but not fabulous category  we also ordered chicken soup  which sort of remined me of something you might get in a school cafeteria    more like chicken bulion  the bill was $20 for 2 people and we were pleasantly stuffed the line was short when we got there but certainly take heed to what the reviewers are saying   by the time we left  at like 6pm on a very wet and rainy sunday  the diehards were lining up out in the street umbrellas up 
went there to introduce dumplings to my non asian friend  service was horrendous  when i was ordering  the waitress yelled at me to speak louder like i was a 4 year old kid who did something mischievous  obviously  if i'm repeating my order that means i couldn't hear that the order has been taken  other workers were rude to the extent that i couldn't enjoy my food also  the dumplings aren't that great  it's good but don't order the crab ones; everytime i had those there were crab shells in it a good restaurant should provide a good environment which includes services; a place to enjoy food outside the house  might as well just stick to delivery rather than sucking up to the rudeness 
best xls for sure  i like them better than joe's  absolutely  the rest of the food here is generally decent the various noodle soups are fine  the shanghai rice cakes are a bit greesy  but tasty i do like the scallion pancake  and my wife likes the "fried bun with chies and egg" and gets it every time we go  last time we were there  we had this tofu appetizer that i thought was fantastic  it came out of the cold steam table just to the right of the entrance  i don't know what it's called but i'm going back for it 
xiao long bao at nan shian can kick more ass than the ones at joe shanghai  no question pros  the food  soup dumplings are filled with a good amount of soup  and the dumpling skin is thin  indescribable  well worth the wait  because there will likely be a wait (up to 20 minutes for getting seated  and up to 15 minutes for getting your soup dumpling order[s]  since everyone is ordering it)  cons  the setting  there was no air conditioning in the summer; i remember when it was really hot  we were wearing shorts and literally sweating puddles into the seats  i hope things have changed  because i still want to go back there even when the weather's sizzling  the dumplings are perfect for cold days  but so good that i would go even if the weather's sizzling; i'll just remember to wear some absorbent pants 
the xiao long bao is definitely the best in the ny  or could be the best in the whole u s   am i exaggerated? arrrr  probably not  go try it yourself!   the other stuffs are only soso perhaps nothing special which you can eat it in any shanghainese restaurants   hey  why order for something that isn't popular for the place?  the service is  _    just like most other chinese restaurants    
amazing soup dumplings   we had the pork and the crab   both were delicious but i preferred the pork   my only regret is not getting the sliced beef on top of the scallion pancakes after reading about how good everyone said it was   they sat us w complementary hot tea which was great bc it was cold and rainy outside   you can actually watch the  make the soul dumplings in the first room in the back by the kitchen    pretty cool   why when the waitress said "would u like shredded beef on top of those scallion pancakes"? would i say "no thanks"   idiot!  oh well    i guess i will have to g o back soon   i also need to decide if they are better than joel's   i have had both now and can not decide   i'm giving the slight edge to nan xiang bc they are cheaper and seem a little more fresh 
i'm a huge fan of ding tai fung and i have yet to find a spot in new york that will satisfy my xiao long bao craving   we got the spicy beef and tripe appetizer  green onion pancake with beef  gluten  xiao long bao  vegetables dumplings  and seafood rice cake   to be honest  i thought everything was just okay   the xiao long bao definitely tasted better than joe's shanghai as the skin was lighter and it was way juicier inside   however  i thought the onion pancake with beef wasn't very good as it was very doughy and you barely got any beef inside the pancake   the spicy beef and tripe was decent but yet again not up to par with the ones i've had in la   i don't know if i'd come back here again to be honest but it is relatively cheap for the amount of food you're getting   and  i think it deserves 3 stars   very average 
i've been coming here for years   it's tradition to come here with my best friends after getting a hair cut from fancy wave   my friends grew up eating taiwanese food  i did not and when i first started frequenting this restaurant i did not expect it to be much different from the canto style food i'm used to   boy was i wrong my friends come here for their beef noodle soup and their taiwanese breakfast   although  their beef noodles are tasty  hearty with a good amount of chewiness i'm more of a fan of their noodle soup with a side of fried pork chops   the fried pork chops with the noodle soup evens out the saltiness of the pork making my taste buds very happy onto the breakfast dishes   when i eat you tiao (fried savory type doughnut cruller)  it's always in my congee jok or it's fried in rice noodles   the taiwanese eat you tiao inside a shao bing (toasted sesame seed flat bread) making a double carb dish   then you dunk it into a bowl of steaming hot soy bean milk   then there's fan tuan which you can either order sweet or savory   it's basically rice with some type of filling such as lo sung (pork floss)  pickles and  you guessed it  you tiao   all the ingredients are placed together and then you roll it into a cylinder shape using plastic wrap   if you want their breakfast dishes  be sure to come in the morning or eally afternoon so why three stars?although i've never had a bad experience here  my taste buds is not too fond of dishes that are very sweet like the soy bean milk   i always walk out of this restaurant thinking what snack i can order from another restaurant to satisfy my taste buds i don't know why my friends and i have avoided ordering the xiao long bao but from reading the other reviews it will be a must for my next visit 
first time venturing out to queens for food  leave manhattan and head to queens for an oasis of good chinese and korean food  the shanghai dumplings are the best i have ever had  we also ordered the spicy beed noodle soup and the scallion pancakes  this place is good and worth the drive out of manhatten  we went on a week day after lunch time and there was no wait 
best soup dumpling in nyc also have try the spicy beef tripe and fried dimpling  just don't order the jelly fish because there aren't any in it but whole bunch cucumbers 
a well deserved 5 stars goes to nan shian dumpling house    and oddly enough  not for their dumplings  although they are excellent   i loved everything that we ordered  dumplings of course  but the stir fried rice cakes and veggies  (not too msg y)  more noodles (just the right amount of chewy)  scallion pancake (excellent crispy to chewy ratio)  soy bean milk (so silky)  and you tiu (tasty but a little dense)    everything was so authentic and amazing   it was exactly what i was craving all week long and when i got it it was glorious!!!the only thing is that flushing is far for manhattan ites  and once you get there  there's a crazy long line   there's not a really large waiting standing space   if people lined both sides of the little walkway that leads into the restaurant  a barely thin person might be able to squeeze through  but there's almost always an uncomfortable brushing of body parts   also  be warned   my friends who came with me were not adequately prepared for all of the fried food we were going to eat   we ate a lot of it   but it was amazing  if you're from the bay area and miss eating food at ranch 99 or marina  this is the place for you  but much better   oh  did i mention it's cheap?  three tables full of food and we each paid $11 
the soup dumplings here are the best i've ever had   ten times better than joe's shanghai soup dumplings   they pack an amazing amount of soup without the dumpling skin falling apart   it's about $6 for a set of 6 dumplings which comes out to a buck each   not bad there's always a wait to get in   once you're in  order a noodle dish cause the dumplings take a while to be served  but soo worth it 
this place sucks big time  do not even show your face there  they will rip you off  very expensive and bad service that is why i am giving them 2 stars 
a lot of people have been raving about the pork soup dumplings  so my friends and i decided to put them to the test  overall they were not bad  the pork  could have used more seasoning but the broth was tasty  getting only 6 was a bummer since i am used 8 at joe shanghai in chinatown would i go back    nope! their rice cake albeit tasty  tasted like chow fun which is not a good thing   i can see the appeal to the untrained palate but this place especially in flushing should have been better
i'm starting on yelp by marking up my favorite places   nan xiang is up there   i would say one of the best in chinatown   originally popular with locals and chinese americans  and now with foodies starting to venture over  nan xiang has had always had great food  and a menu broad enough to please the americans (scallion pancake w or w o beef  soup dumplings  red bean puff) chinese americans (panfried noodles or soup noodles  soup dumplings  sweet soymilk) or the chinese (fried cruller w  shaobing  salty soybean milk or soybean pudding  fuqi feipian  bamboo shoots  soup dumplings)   the food is fresh and made constantly throughout the day  and is crisp and has the right flavors     not much ambiance and cash only  with some waiting & no frills service  nan xiang is a food destination   but the food is worth it 
i have heard a lot of good feedback from this restaurant  so few weeks ago i finally got to tried it  we ordered 1 order of the soup dumplings  1 noodle soup  and scallion pancake  we werent hungry so we just ordered a little  the food were good  the soup dumplings were better than some places  but nothing special for the scallion pancake and the noodle  the noodle kind of tasted bland to me tho  but still acceptable  we went in an hour before they close  so when we were still eating they started mop next to us  i understand that they want to go home fast  but the bleach' smell were really strong  overall  i think its not bad 
best xiao long bao in the city!  get the house special (nan xiang xiao long bao)     as a born shanghaiese  this is closest to the real nan xiang xiao long bao   love it!  and the price is awesome too!  $3 50 for 6 xiao long bao   now that is a deal!
i have since been back  figuring i should at least taste the food once  i ordered 2 crab dumplings  the turnip cake  and the jellyfish appetizer  everything was unbelievably bad  the turnip cakes  which were little fried turnip dumplings really  were very generic  you could get the same quality at some chinese supermarkets nearby the jellyfish app is a scam  i know it says jellyfish and turnip salad on the menu  but the ratio of jellyfish to turnip was about 1 3   meaning 3 quarters of the plate was just turnip  worse is  it's all mixed together so i can't even just fish out the jellyfish the dumplings  which came about 45 minutes later  had absolutely no crab taste to it  now  i've had these at joe's  din tai fung  some local places in shanghai  and whether good or bad  they all had a very crabby flavor  the ones here  you couldn't tell whether it was the standard or the crab  service is nonexistent here  right off the bat  we were missing utensils  while taking an order for 3 items  the waitress left one out  tea service is nonexistent  you can open the lid or tilt it or whatnot  but nobody checks unless you ask  asking for the check took about 10 minutes  and collecting the money was about another 10  very disorganized staff i have a feeling a lot of people come here because it looks like the real thing  behind glass windows  guys wearing masks are constantly making the dumplings  and they have tons of steamers going at it  unfortunately  they just don't deliver in taste  when that happens  i usually let them make up a bit in service  sadly  they don't deliver there either i'm done with this place  never going back again 
awesome soup dumplings  i've also tried the beef pancake  crispy chow mein noodle  and various other dumplings  a quick tip  i believe the crab soup dumplings are more expensive but to my dismay did not have crab in them (at least i didn't notice it)  they seemed to top it with a little crab  but it was still made of pork soup   other than that  love this place!
a half dozen juicy little dumplings hit the spot after a long flight from sfo to jfk  nan shian was the first stop i made after getting off my 5 hour flight  i love xiao long bao! you bite into each one and it's an explosion of soupy goodness  mmmmmm  if you have a passion for soup dumplings like i do nan shian dumpling is a must try 
the soup dumplings are pretty good (i'm a total snob  i've eaten at the original ding tai fung in taipei all my life so color me spoiled) but the little "cold" dishes are what makes this place really special   just be ready for  lots of noisy chinese people and at random times  a long ass wait 
in a land of strange characters and new smells  nan xiang dumpling house can be easily overlooked   i lived in china  i love dumplings  and i love the nan xiang dumpling house    even if the waitress did spill my soy bean drink on my pants (it was an accident  she swears!)    i come to flushing for work quite frequently  and i am usually in the bind of telling a bunch of chinese where the best chinese food in flushing is   doing this as a non chinese gives you a very thin margin for error  but when people are hungry for dumplings  this is where i come!  their technical skill is actually very refined  as you will see the thinness of the dough and how much soup they are able to fit in each dumpling   there isn't much room to go astray here because as long as you are ordering dumplings  you are going to be ok!  a great addition is the spring onion pancakes  which are some of the best i've ever had 
the shao lung baos are very authentic to what you'll find in shanghai taipei  the pork and crab varieties are the best  they make the skin very very thing compared to other wannabe dumpling places who make thick bun style skins i also had the beef noodle soup  which is ok  but not much to rave about  the soup base has a spicy hint  prices are very reasonable for great food as compared to other dumpling places with sad dumplings that charge an arm and leg 
they are always so busy so you might need to wait for the seating  but that's okay with me  i only go there for soup dumplings~soup dumplings only    i tried their noodles and lo mien(?)and some side orders before  meh  i don't think i like any of those  i thought i've said that before  but yea soup dumplings only 
i have been back several times to take out  the take out service is fast and they havent screwed up my order yet  the dumplings hold well  which was unexpected  as always  the food is delicious   i will continue to go here 
i always make a stop here when visiting my mom  this time  we also tried the shanghai rice cakes and the cucumber salad which were super simple dishes but very delicious  the downside about filling up on all the other delicious carb plates is that the soup dumplings come last which by then you are too full to enjoy them which was the case the last time  since i do not like food waste  i stuffed myself with the last dumpling and oh so did not feel so good afterwards 
yes  the soup dumplings are fantastic  this place is very popular and very crowded  though  so plan accordingly 
the best version of my current favorite chinese food the soup dumplings here are very excellent although occasionally a bit uneven (thick skin  not enough soup  weirdly fishy  crab ones)  and sloooow  the rest of the menu is pretty stock  i've had the pan fried noodles  raman  fried dumplings  dim sum dumplings with peanut sauce  scallion pancake with beef  fried pork chop soup  and all of it was pretty hit or miss and nothings amazing in the bunch  but the soup dumplings are worth the 4 stars  when they're right the skins are the thinnest  the soup is the savoriest and richest  and the meat is perfect  tender and tasty and not the slightest bit chewy 
amazing!  beef and scallion pancakes a must although everything was great! well worth the wait 
heads up   this place isn't called "noodle house"  in fact  there isn't even any english on their storefront  if you're looking for the shanghainese restaurant  do so by address; also the store's sign is red and there is a little bamboo fountain in front of the storefront craving some xiao long bao (soup dumplings)  my family and i came here on a sunday evening after a nice  relaxing day at spacastle  we checked joe's shanghai first  but  as usual  it was as packed as the 6 train at rush hour  only madder  people yelling  customers gesticulating angrily  ticket and hand waving  i chuckled as i imagined their surprise when they were finally seated only to learn that they would be joined by another 6 randoms for some really tight quarters continuing down to prince street  we arrived at a slightly crowded nan shian dumpling house (surprisingly busy for mid evening sunday)  the decor is kind of bare bones  but it's well lit and looks clean  the place seats no more than 30 people  a bit tight  but manageable  if it's crowded  you may have to share a table  luckily  the wait wasn't too bad  it was about 15 minutes for a party of four and the turnover was pretty quick  *if there's a line  make sure you go in and grab a number  you'll have to squeeze through the narrow corridor and make uncomfortable body contact with others  but it's a small price to pay for possibly the best soup dumplings in the city how does one judge a soup dumpling? as with all dumplings  the key is to have the thinnest wrapper as possible while making sure there is a good amount of meat  also  the dumpling must not break   otherwise  the soup or juicy goodness will be lost well  this place's xiao long bao (on their menu  steamed pork buns and steamed crab meat & pork buns) have unbelievably delicate wrappers  delicious soup  and tasty meat  the toughest part of enjoying one of these suckers (no pun intended) is transferring the soup bun from the steaming basket to your spoon and then biting it correctly to make sure you can enjoy all the soup without losing it all over the plate or burning your tongue  when i went there  the soup buns took longer than expected because they were actually wrapping the soup buns in order to steam them as we ordered them  i'm not sure if this is standard protocol  but they were absolutely fresh their potstickers pan fried dumplings  having the same wrapper properties as the soup dumplings  also were quite good  the crispy noodles w  pork and shitake mushrooms were also fantastic  this is one of the best and most authentic chinese dishes  definitely one that the corner take out place won't have   unless you live in flushing  finishing my meal with a warm bowl of sweet soy bean milk was the perfect ending to a satisfying meal and a perfect way to steel myself against the cold avoid the wait at shanghai joe's and come here!
great handmade soup dumplings  though be careful because they rip easily  i highly recommend the spicy beef tendons and rice cakes 
soup dumplings is why i come here  they're good  not great but the service is quick enough to warrant me to visit from time to time  the cold appetizers are good enough to try as well  the noodle dishes are so so and the scallion pancake was way too greasy! i'll see ya on the waiting line because they almost always have a line waiting for tables!
this place was pretty much amazing went tonight (thursday) and it wasn't overcrowded by was definitely busy their xlb have a very thin skin and the soup is amazing inside  i had the pork which were great  also tried the vegetable dumplings which i could've ordered myself  ladies were making the dumplings right next to the table which was cool to watch their mad skills  also tried the pan fried noodles  which i believe they make themselves also  and they were pretty good too  i can't say that i've had shanghai joe's or any of the other famous ones in the city but i can tell you it will be hard to live up to this place!!go! take the 7 out to flushing you will not be disappointed!!!
if it's your first time having xiao long bao  i'd suggest observing some of the other customers for strategies before attempting to eat yourself  like some other yelpers i burnt my mouth on my first dumpling  but after tasting the soup (after it cooled!) and the delicious meat inside all was forgiven  they were truly delicious and a very unique experience  the xiao mai is delicious as well! the service is not super great  but hey  that's not really what you're there for anyway right?
i admit that i had higher hopes for this place  given the string reviews and long lines  i swung by around 8 pm  wanting to try the soup dumplings  given that it was still crowded  i placed a to go order which seemed to annoy the hostess for some reason  i was oddly pleased by the 15 minute wait for my food   to me  this implies careful preparation of what i am sure is an art  however  when i got back to my hotel room to eat  every attempt to pick up a dumpling resulted in a small perforation forming and precious dumpling innards to spill out!!  i had to forgo chopsticks and carefully use a spoon (as well as pour sauce over all the dumplings  versus dipping them) to avoid eating empty dumplingsi do wonder if given the physics of placing these in an airtight container for 5 minutes  if this is why these holes developed   or perhaps these dumplings are more fragile than the ones on houston that i am used to   
hands down this is my favorite shanghai food place in queens i recommend all my clients to come here for the soup dumplings and so far they haven't complainedi believe this place was featured in the new york times magazine a while back since there was a rush of out of town customers all lined up for the hype believe the hype  must eats 1) soup dumplings( regular and with crab meat)  comparing to joe's shanghai and the ones i've had around the city this soup dumpling has a less thick greasy broth  the dough is thinner too which means i can ingest more of this goodness !2) red bean pancake ( not the pastry kind but the flat ones deep fried to golden perfection  it isnt too sweet either)come try the items recommended here you won't be disappointed!
this place is populated by locals and for good reason  if you are a fan of xiao lonb bao  this is the place to go in queens  the food is cheap and delicious  i'm vegetarian and was pleasantly surprised(all you carnivores out there  mark my words!) to find excellent vegetable dumplings  steamed to perfection and in the perfect casing of a thin  tasty dough wrapper  in other places it's thick dough surrounding a mediocre and oversalted filling  my boyfriend had tried their signature xiao long bao  said it was tasty(and this was his second tasting meal) but raved more about the steamed vegetarian dumplings  i think he had not quite mastered the art of slurping up the soup from the dumpling and eating the hot little morsel at the same time  though by his fourth one  he had learned from the locals  expect a wait if you order the xiao long bao  the veggie dumplings came out sooner  so kick back  order some appetizers and wait for those hard working cooks to make your belly happy  flushing is indeed a food mecca 
best soup dumplings i've ever had! the meat was yummy  the shell was perfectly doughy  and the soup was in abundance  it took forever to get a seat  and forever to get the dumplings  but it was totally worth it  every bit of dumpling was a tiny piece of heaven  lots of people ordered noodles dishes as well  maybe next time ill some noodles with my soup dumplings!!
just came back from nan xiang  actually went because of the reviews on yelp  all my chinese friends from work recommended joe's shanghai  but this had better reviews so i wanted to try it  not impressed  the food was good but not the best  the shumai was my favorite of all dishes  we had both crab and pork dumplings and i was disappointed  maybe its because i'm used to having with shrimp  but it had no flavor and it was not sticky  when have this dish the soup is usually really yummy and makes lips sticky   it was neither here  we also had the spicy wontons and all i could taste was peanut butter  we also had the noodles with chili oil which were good not great  the restaurant is very clean  the seating is comfortable and they are fast but the food is ok  wish i had gone into nyc chinatown instead 
i love going to this place for xiao long bao and other delicious little dishes  i prefer the original soup dumplings without the crab meat  the flavor is good and the skin is just right  i also like the soy milk and the soy custard here  the spicy bamboo shoot is also very delicious and the scallion pancake is nice a crispy  there are some things on the menu that are not that wonderful but i guess some people like it  for example the sweet sticky rice roll is basically a fried curler dipped in sugar and wrapped in sticky rice  also  the availability of the items listed on their menu is inconsistent  somehow they are always out of something that i want  i have never tried the jelly fish since they never seem to have it  however  they always have the soup dumplings  and despite the poor service and the issues i mentioned  i still go back for more dumplings  i stopped by for some soup dumplings this saturday and saw that they were closed (they appear to be doing some renovation)  hopefully  they will be open the next time i visit flushing 
i love soup dumplings and these   were heaven my family went late morning on a sunday and there was a crowd of people already waiting outside   we were told that we'd only have to wait 10 15 minutes but it ended up being more than 30 minutes   it was still worth it because the dumplings are made to order and come piping hot to your table   you have to be careful transferring the dumpling into your spoon and i like to bite off the top  pour some of the sauce in and then drink the soup!  the skin is not too tough or too delicate and the meat is adequately flavored and the broth is sinfully delicious   the price is very affordable as well giving you six large soup dumplings for $5 50   the only downsides are that the restaurant is small  crowded  smells like vinegar and the staff is rushed  rude and doesn't speak english well   also  my brother has been there a few other times and says that most of the other items on the menu are average so if you come here  come for the soup dumplings 
very yummy xiao long baos! minus one star because of slow service  but it's worth the wait for the freshly made dumplings 
came here with high expectations cause everyone raves about their soup dumplings they only give you 6? kind of a ripoff  even more so when you compare it to joe's shanghai  plus  the soup tastes oily  instead of meat flavored like it should  so if i remember correctly  it's about $5 50 for 6 soup dumplings that don't taste too great  i think you're better off going to joe's shanghai; they have 8 soup dumplings for $4 65  and they taste twice as good  not even exaggerating not coming here again 
this location has one of the best soup dumplings in flushing   their noodles soups are very popular too (not the best quality but still satisfying)   can't say much for their other dishes which i didn't find too good   i'm only a fan of the items i mentioned 
good place  we had tried joe's shanghai multiple times before and wanted to try a different place for soup dumplings  i think this is a good place if you have sudden craving for soup dumplings  they make the dumplings fresh and you can actually see the chefs cooking them  will come back here for a second round  )
definitely good  definitely hot  as a tip   i would wait at least 2 minutes before picking these up with the tongs  they serve them immediately out of the steamer and the skin is delicate in the beginning  only reason why they didnt get 5 stars   i like joe's shanghai on pell street better and dont have to go all the way to flushing to get them
my friend was already raving about this place before we got off the 7 train  you know? i don't think the soup dumpling (xiao long bao) did anything for me here  it was "os os"  off day? i thought the meat was bland  again  maybe it was an off night     i don't know 
our cousins took us here to try what they call the best dumplings in ny  supposedly better than joe's shanghai   i cant say that it's better but it is rather juicy and flavorful   the service is much better than joe's but the wait is much longer   we only tried the dumplings but my mother in law tried the pork buns and said it is the best she's had   i would come back next time and try more 
it's hard not to compare the dumplings from this place to the ones from joe's shanghai  but really the broth from the two places are quite different so i think this place is definitely a must try if you're into xiao long bao  the price is definitely cheaper and you get to see them form the dumplings by hand right in the back of the restaurant! the past two times i've been here  once after the dinner rush (around 8pm) and once in the middle of a weekday afternoon  its been crowded but my friends and i were still seated right away  be aware  however  that its a small restaurant and you might have to rub elbows with the people sitting right next to you  i highly suggest the bamboo shoots in chili oil as an appetizer and the beef with rice sticks dish as an entree  once we saw the group next to us order the bamboo shoots we immediately knew we had to order it  they're fresh and it turns out to be a very nice light appetizer to start the meal  the xiao long bao had the longest wait  it was the last item that came to the table  but the wait was well worth it  its much less greasy and rich tasting than the crab and pork dumplings at joe's shanghai 
ok this really is the best soup dumpling in nyc  hands down   joe's shanghai  you better watch out   however!!!!warning*** everything else is either ok or subpar i had the wine chicken    it wasn't good a couple of other things we ordered were ok  but it's really all about the soup dumplings  4 stars for soup dumplings  2 5 for everythign else
delicious  soup dumplings (xiao long bao) are great  though i wish they were a little bit smaller  the scallion & beef pancake is out of control as are the braised soybeans  while you're waiting  look at the different appetizers sitting in the food cart in the front of the restaurant next to the hostess station  pick out what you want  eat it  i think the next time i'm there  i'm getting the tripe  it really looks delicious 
not much to say that hasn't been said  came here last night for takeout  got the steamed pork buns (soup dumplings)  soup dumplings are always better fresh and in the restaurant  but these even held up as takeout  better than joe's shanghai  in my opinion 
great dumplings  looooong lines  still worth it 
the best soup dumplings out there  the density of the filling  thickness of the skin  flavor of the broth   all nailed  everything we ordered was pretty hard to swallow  worth the wait  don't be discouraged!
can't say i'm a fan of the service  been here a multitude of times and there have been times when they've forgot to put in a dish that i've ordered  once they forgot to put the my order of pork chop noodles in and another  they forgot to put in my order of jellyfish (which is right there  visible to diners)  when i asked for the items to be canceled because we were almost finished with our food and the dishes still have not arrived (even though they were reminded)  they were most displeased with me  tough sh*t  cups are also stained and once i had lipstick that had not been washed off on mine  just my luck  huh?   there's a staff member there (tall for an asian guy) who holds seats for his friends  staff's friends  i listened in on the conversation when we were supposed to be seated next  the hostess in front told the guy to call the friend on his cell  seriously? also  they let people jump ahead of the line by ripping 2 3 tickets off and discreetly (not discreetly enough for me) handing them in the order they deem appropriate  that being said  the soup dumplings and the appetizers are good  everything else is pretty much standard taiwanese fujianese fare 
food was amazing!!! we don't eat pork so our choices were vegetable dumplings  rice cake with beef & fried noodles with chicken  and beef pepper soup  delicious!!! will definitely go back 
came here bc a friend told me their soup dumplings were better than joes  they were really mind you but i liked joes better  their beef and scallion pancake was really unique and delicious but service was crap but hey  its chinatown   the prices were cheap too! always a plus 
ever since i tried the soup dumplings here i've been 'chasing the dragon' in chinatowns from toronto to miami  to always come back to flushing  queens hands down  best soup dumplings ever  they are made to order  the filling is delicious  the skin is thin  there is a ton of delicious soup and yet the dumpling never breaks before it's time  i have no idea how they pull it off the rest of the food is delicious as well  i am a fan of the scallion pancake with beef and the taro pastries and the beef noodle soup  but the dumplings     wow i am taking off a star for consistently making us share tables with people and less then pleasant service although  i might consider giving it back   for being the place that helped me perfect my 'i'm not pleased' grunt 
the food is decent   i personally prefer the crabmeat soup dumplings from joe's shanghai
as mentioned in a lot of reviews  there is usually a line to get a table   but it is worth the wait   we went there after 10 on a friday night  and still waited about a half hour   wait to get our food was not that long   soup dumplings are as good as joe's shanghai but not as pretentious   beef and scallion pancakes are good but a little too doughy  my daughter loved the pork noodle soup 
best soup dumplings ever!  pops in your mouth and you are slurping every last warm drop   be ready to wait in line though   
as you would expect this is a very busy place   but it well worth any wait   i am still thinking about the udon noodles 
when i heard that there was a soup dumpling place better than joe's shanghai  i had to go there   while the wait was definitely much shorter than at joe's  the soup dumplings were only okay and definitely not as good as joe's in my opinion   oh well 
the soup dumplings are just okay  not great  and don't get me started on the service; they didn't bother to greet us at all when we got there  after we've asked twice  the cashier seems annoyed and gave us a number  the waitress is worse  yelled to make us waiting out of the restaurant  and never bothered to let us know when is our turn  we had to go in and ask once in a while  and they genuinely  truly seem to be dis like their customers  i will not go back again  for my soup dumpling fix there are tons of other places both in chinatown and flushing 
great prices! super clean for cheap food! so yummy!!!how do they do it?their dumplings are out of this world delicious   i'm chinese and i'm a foodie so it takes a lot to bring me to eat here twice in one day   and then 4 days later another visit   i travel to china 4 times a year and all i do is work and eat get the xlb is bomb   the scallion pancake uhm uhm good   and get all the side dishes that appeal to your eye   most likely it will be delicious i have dreams of living closer to this dumpling heaven  ( but i live in la now   
the xiao long bao here is very tasty and the crispy noodles were also good   would recommend this place if you are in flushing!
great soup dumplings! i also had the scallion pancake  it was very good too  definetly will be back 
probably the worst service out of any flushing restaurant  their xiao long bao (soup dumplings) are definitely top notch  but their wait staff is rude  unattentive  and basically completely useless  other than the xiao long bao  the menu doesn't have much to offer  their chicken soup is pretty good tho  lately  it's been taking 25 30 minutes for the xiao long bao orders to come to the table  which is much longer than the wait times before  i'd give the soup dumplings 5 stars and the service 0 stars  so i'll average it out and round up to give them 3 stars  this is the one restaurant where i would whip out my phone to make sure i don't give them more than a 15% tip  i refuse to even give them a penny more 
they don't even need my review   but they deserve it  best pork soupy dumplings i've had in nyc  their pan fried dumplings are exquisite  as are the fresh wontons in spicy peanut sauce  again  the best i've had in nyc   also try the cold spicy beef 'n tripe even if you're not a huge organ meat person  it's surprising  it's great  vegetable dumplings are awesome too but must be gotten hot and eaten right away or they go down a notch more seriously than the other dumplings here 
mehhh   my friend raved about the soup dumplings here  so i trekked all the way to queens to eat it   first of all  they only take cash  so my friend and i had to run to the bank   came back and ordered the soup dumplings and shanghai pan fried noodles   the soup dumplings are good  but not to die for   i mean i don't think it's worth an hour long trip for   the pan fried noodles were    whatever   it tasted like something you could just get at panda express   actually i'm sorry but i prefer panda express' chow mein over this   but the place was poppin so it seems like a local favorite   i didn't like the service   it was pretty shoddy   the waitress was completely unfriendly  creating a not so comfortable dining experience   my friend concluded  welcome to new york 
slow  slow  the staff just don't care  they stand around chatting and can't be bothered to bring food out until it's been sitting around for a while after preparation  soup dumplings were very disappointing  too big and rustic to be considered good  a cold chicken dish was mostly bones kind of a rip off  hot dishes were really mediocre  not the worst meal ever but there's lots better out there 
in my opinion better than joes shanghai   onion pancake has good fluffy consistency   beef with pickled turnip noodle is amongst the best here   favorite place to bring my friends from out of town 
we've noticed nan shian for a while now but never had the chance to actually visit until yesterday  i'm a sucker for a good xiao long bao and this place seemed to be constantly packed so expectations were pretty high i must admit  even at almost 3pm you had to wait 15 20 minutes for a table  the space is pretty small though which explains the constant wait and you'll be sitting elbow to elbow with strangers (unless you have a party of 4 or 6) the highly touted xiao long bao are freshly made in a little alcove next to the dining area where 3 4 workers are busy at all times  when done  they're relatively large  plump and chock full of soupy goodness  they're definitely quite good but my current favorite still remains at the shanghai cuisine in chinatown  my favorite of all time was from the peking duck house (also in chinatown) back before they moved locations  but that was decades ago  but you won't go wrong with these  we ordered one each of the regular and crab egg and truthfully  i couldn't tell much of a difference between the two we also ordered the spicy wontons (disappointing due to addition of peanut sauce)  the chicken soup (quite good with ginseng and other herbs)  and a spicy cow stomach cold platter (very good although a bit different than what we've had in other places) overall it was a pretty good meal  next time (if we have the time to wait around again)  we'll try out their breakfast fare (sao bin yeou tiaou) with sweet soy milk  plus their stir fried noodles look very good as well 
the soup dumplings (aka xiao long bao) are pretty solid  on par with joe's shanghai   the crab meat is better than the pork my favorite dish is the pan fried shanghai noodles   serving size is small though   if i order two appetizers (for myself) and one order of the noodles  i'll be okay  but any less and i need more   the other things i have tried (and i've tried most of the menu) is okay    also  when compared with other chinese food places  the prices are considered very pricey   make sure you have plenty of time if you want to hit this place up because the lines are almost always at least 20 minutes long  often longer 
the xiaolong bai was of course great  however everything else was forgettable  noodle soup dishes came out way too salty  the shanghai udon noodle dish was nothing special  i'm not sure its not worth it to wait online just for xiao long bao  might as well goto joe's the main dishes are better 
a group of 8 decided to have a mini college reunion at this particular dumpling house on a saturday night  wait wasn't too bad (maybe 20 minutes) at 8pm  we ordered several dishes including crab and pork dumplings  honestly  they were one of the best dumplings i've ever tasted! i always thought joe shanghai and din tai fung (in la) were pretty good  but i think nan shian tops them all! when we got our bill  it came out to be $12 person     so cheap!the only part i didn't like about this place was that we had to wait a good hour for those dumplings  but i guess it was worth the wait 
i don't know what happened to this place   i use to like it but recent trip there has not been as good    something changed    nov 2013 
it was 40 degrees and freezing outside and we saw a line nearly out the door on a wednesday (or tues?) night and we had to follow the crowd  good thing we did  we waited a little less than 20 mins  the waiters were very efficient  we ordered the soup dumplings (of course   gotta order what's in their damn name!)  the spicy bean curd with edamame  tripe intestine  chicken with rice cake  and 2 soybean milks  mmmmm it was damn goooood! that's all i have to say  ) now you know where to get some good shanghai food 
hubby and i went here after the us open tonight since i was craving soup dumplings and read such rave reviews on yelp   flushing was only one stop away so it seemed like the perfect opportunity here's my breakdown 1) pork & crab soup dumplings   they were good and had a nice skin but i prefer shanghai cafe's soup dumplings  i feel like theirs is more flavorful 2) scallion pancakes with beef   pretty good but a bit oily for my preference   3) sweet soy milk (cold)   it seemed watered down and very weak compared to others i've had   it was so so so unfortunately  i'm breaking the 4 & 5 star ratings trend   maybe my expectations were too high but it wasn't worth the hype for me   i'll be going to shanghai cafe for my soup dumplings in chinatown or going to white bear for spicy wontons if i'm in the neighborhood 
i don't understand what people are raving about   i ordered the xlb and an iced soy milk to go  when i got home  all the buns popped and the pink meat residue leaked out  i ate all six buns and got a stomach ache the next morning  it was probably the late night snacking but still marking this a bad experience 
way better than joe's shanghai!  don't even think joe's shanghai when you think soup dumplings   this is the place to be   i've converted 10 or more people into believers   try the homemade soy milk  it's good but the soup dumplings are the best in nyc bar none!
one of my favorite places in flushing   best to come during the weekdays or early morning in the weekend   otherwise there is a wait even thought they expanded and there is more seating!  only after they expanded have i attempted to bring my kids with me otherwise with their old space forget it   there wasn't even even elbow room since the tables were ontop of each other   my favorite picks   pork & cabbage noodle soupnoodle with scallion sauceappetizer   spicy beef & tripescallion pancake with sliced beefsweet soy bean milk   red bean puff
ahh  the xiao long bao from nan xiang dumpling house    i have heard a lot about and been longing to try it  they were closed for renovation the first time i went and now i finally tried them  i only ordered what they were famous for; xiao long bao with crab meat  we got only 6 xiao long bao per order  but they were slight bigger  the soup inside was very delicious and pipping hot  the meat was soft  the crab meat was lacking and we found some soft shells from the crab  i barely tasted the crab meat in some of them  the dumpling skin was thick and not smooth at all  also did i mention  my cup of tea smelled like dish washing soup 
everything here except for the scallion pancakes was amazing! this place used to be much better years ago  they increased prices and the quality has slightly decreased  but it's still delicious and recommend it 
i've been here twice   once in january 2010 and more recently  yesterday both times we ordered the pork soup dumplings and the beef scallion pancakes   both are really good  especially the beef scallion pancakes (despite feeling your arteries clog up as you eat them)   i can't really taste the difference between the freshly made soup dumplings at nan xiang and the soup dumplings at joe's shanghai in chinatown   yesterday's wait for the dumplings was a solid 30 minutes  while the first time was about 15 minutes   i'd suggest that nan xiang adopt joe's method of reducing this wait by taking the soup dumpling order while customers wait on line or just as they're being seated i'm on a search for the beef scallion pancakes elsewhere   otherwise  unless i'm in the area  i wouldn't trek to nan xiang 
i've been going to this place for a while now  best soup dumplings in ny  its worth it even though they don't take credit cards  needs more wait staff  and faster service  they recently expanded into the space next door and now no more 30min wait time for a table 
i haven't been to chinatown's joe shanghai in ages  because this place is closer to me and has the best soup dumplings in nyc 
thanks john w  and diana t  i would've never found this place if it weren't for your reviews  this place has  hands down  the best soup dumplings i've ever tasted  i brought my gramps who's lived in taipei most of his life and he compared it favorably to the best place there  the veggie steamed dumplings were also out of this world  yes  i said veggie! this means a lot because as you know  vegetarians have awful taste in food and i'm the anti vegetarian  i'd eat my baby sister before i'd eat baby spinach  good thing i don't have a baby sister  their noodles were delicious but they didn't have the beef noodle soup i'm used to having  they had a beef noodle soup  but it was weird   sauteed  then tossed in the bowl of noodes  it was tasty  though 
some of the best xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) i've ever had   pretty decent scallion pancakes too   the waitresses were kind of irritated that we had such a big group  but i wouldn't expect any less from a busy chinese restaurant in the middle of flusshing 
sooooo good! great food! great prices! go with someone who knows what to order or you'll be totally lost  this was all comfort food for me that i haven't had in forever! was so happy to find it! just wish it wasn't so far from us!
wow! i can't believe after eating in flushing almost every week  i first find out about this place now  but it was extremely good  fresh and delicious   my new go to spot for shanghai cuisine 
deeeeelicious  at a little under $6 for a steamer basket of 6  the pork soup dumplings were just about the best things you could get anywhere for that price  thin skin that didn't break and had just the right consistency  plenty of flavorful fatty broth inside  and a right sized ball of pork to end  i think this is the best place outside of la's dintaifeng to get soup dumplings  we also ordered the fish salted cabbage noodle soup which was umami at its best (add a little bit of vinegar to it to complement the slightly sweet broth)  garlic cucumber cold dish and scallion pancakes  we had already been eating for 3 hours at various other joints in flushing so we didn't get a chance to try more of the menu; sounds like i have to come back!
chinese cuisinein chinese this place is known as 'nanxiang xiao long bao'  with a literal translation of 'soup dumpling'  totally nothing related to the english name of the restaurant  yet it does serve noodles  but it's specialty is the soup dumplings a friend of mine recommended this place because he had been going here for a while now   i have to say their soup dumplings are the best i have ever had   better than joe's shanghai (tourist trap) and shanghai cafe (my last favorite)   i measure soup dumplings by the amount of broth that exists in it  the taste of the broth and the size of the dumplings and this place has it all right the dumpling price is on par with most places $4 50  however you are given 6 instead of the traditional 8 dumplings   that is a slight negative  but for me  if the dumpling is so good  i can forgive that fact   the dumpling skin is thin enough to hold the abundance of soup without being punctured and is not too thick like some places   when you pour the soup out from your spoon  it fills it up and then some   if the dumpling doesn't have much soup in it  it's crap  you are just eating a regular dumpling!  you can even see the soup filled up inside the dumpling before you pick it up   the pork medallion is just sized right and it even has scallions in it!  it was really good i suggest not ordering the rice cakes here  as it is a bit overcooked and too soy saucy   not recommended to order that   it's not my preference the way they cook it otherwise  this place has suddenly become my new place for taiwanese breakfast   the sesame bread and beef was well done   the scallion pancake wrapped with beef was ok   king 5 across the street does it a little better  as the scallion pancake is more flavorful   we also had the chive and egg dumpling which was the best out of all the places i've tried   alot of scallion  the crust of the dumpling was not too thick and doughy   this place is a slight hole in the wall  limited seating for about maybe 25 at most and sometimes really busy during prime lunchtime on weekends  but it is well worth the trek to flushing   i'm sorry to say  but if you go to joe's shanghai  you aren't having good soup dumplings 
so here's my opinion  if you're looking for the best xlb in the city  go to shanghai cafe in manhattan  but  nan xiang is close behind and is pretty good and tasty  get the two kinds  maybe some chicken soup  scallion pancake  pan fried buns  and stay away from the seaweed and garlic 
the soup dumplings are great  made to order  it took 30 min before we got our order on a friday night  we only waited a few min for our table but there was a line waiting for tables when we left at 11 pm  one star off for the spotty service; they left out our cold appetizer order 
best soup dumplings in nyc  much more refined and sophisticated than my second favorite xlb at shanghai cafe
5 stars for the xiao long bao  the other things on the menu are decent  but they're not why you come here  the place gets crowded  especially on weekends  and the dumplings take a little while to come out  so be prepared to wait a bit  all in all  a fun place with great xiao long bao and prices to match 
the crispy noodles with beef and the rice cake with beef were great  they had the same greasy brown sauce which really hit the spot after a 2 month chinese food hiatus  on the other hand the crispy beef pastry did not go down so well  the sweet and crispy crust did not go well with the oily and savory beef inside  the rice dumplings were flavorless and mushy  and the wontons w  peanut sauce were also flavorless and too spicy  the chefs here apparently do not taste and season the food  a little bit of salt could really have brought out the flavors  it's really a shame the soup dumplings    the main reason people come here were off  the soup was slightly too tart and the meat was not as savory as joe's shanghai's  i got tired of eating these after the first ~3 and struggled to eat the rest  one person in our group could only eat 2 and she was done  stick with joe's shanghai for soup dumplings  it's worth the wait to summarize  i felt like each dish was missing something  everything tasted "off " my guess was that it was so busy the chefs did not have time to carefully prepare the food 
absolutely amazing soup dumplings and scallion pancake with beef   will definitely be returning to flushing just so i can eat here again 
my favorite xiao long bao place!!!  after i discovered the restaurant  i completely forgot about the existence of joe's shanghai for their soup dumplings (in fact i stopped going there for almost 5 years now)   it's nothing comparable   the soup in those soup dumplings tastes so much "cleaner" while the soup dumplings at joe's shanghai tend to be more oily to me   i usually go there with couple of friends and order so much  and the bill comes still light   most of noodle bowls are really good  too  and other cold appetizers like crashed cucumber and drunken chicken are great   the service is ok   i would say their service is "practical" instead of pleasing their customers   most of the waiters understand english   it is usually very crowded with full of hungry people during weekends   every time i go there during their peak time  i want to laugh because there is this big mirror all over the wall   while you wait there  you can see your "hunger" and "envy" written all over on your face in the mirror  and actually you can almost look like a ghost staring at people who are eating the xiao long bao already   but it's worth the wait  definitely  even we all can look like ghosts in the mirror 
it was about a 10 minute wait in the beginning  but not too bad  we used the time to look at the menu and scope out what we wanted  the xiao long baos were really good; they didn't break when you were trying to get them  but the skin wasn't very thick either so that it was easy to bite a small hole to suck up the soup  there's two different kinds  and we got one order of each  the cold appetizers we got were also very good  and they were pretty good portions too  the green onion pancakes were meh (didn't really see taste any green onions)  and had a flaky consistency  perhaps some people like it this way  but it doesn't jive with me  i'd recommend just sticking wit the xiao long baos and the cold appetizers 
good xlbs  but the best? i'm not really sure  this place has gotten a lot of hype and when i saw the michelin recommendation outside the restaurant this weekend  i threw a huge fit trying to get my family to eat there instead of canton gourmet next door (i didn't win  i pouted  but not for long since food was coming my way)  well  i imposed myself on a friend who lived near by and ate there yesterday  since i've been meaning to go there for over a year and i just saw the michelin recommendation  my expectations were high  maybe too high so i'm going to agree  the ingredients were fresh and different than joe's near by  but better? that's going to depend on a lot of factors  factors that change anytime i'm eating i made sure to order scallion pancakes  because they're my favorite  i forget how much these usually go for but here  its $3 a pop  that's a little pricey for dough and a (light) sprinkle of scallion  nevertheless  it had a fluffiness to it that i have not found elsewhere so my friend and i ordered a 2nd helping  my b f and his friends sat near by and took some from us and i was pissed  (they're that good!)i modeled my ordered after joe's the best i could but couldn't help but give up an extra $1 for the crab and pork soup dumplings which i would never care to eat at joe's  i definitely smelled the crab and tasted the texture of crab but the flavoring was predominately pork  i also found a crab shell (at least i hope it was a crab shell) in my dumpling so i was both sad but pleased to know yes! they use real crab meat! but damn  they're not that good at cleaning it up  eek we had an order of pork dumplings as well but i guess we didn't get it fast enough b c it ended up being cold and not too tasty  see  my friend is a much slower eater and i really had to pace myself or she probably wouldn't have gotten any more food  luckily  we ordered a 2nd helping of the pork dumplings and they were much better  warmer  etc but of course we have to compare it to joe's  which is why i only give it 3 stars  yes  the freshness  less fattiness of the pork as well as the thinness of the skin sets it apart from joe's however i'm pretty sure the best foods are the fatty foods  2nd  the best part about a soup dumpling is the soup  and there wasn't much soup in this dumpling  and whatever soup i got lacked a flavor (i'm sure that comes from the fattiness)  all in all  i was underwhelmed by this place but that doesn't mean i wouldn't go back  if i felt like sacrificing my diet and gym work out  i'd probably go to joe's  as grittier as it is  it's a very very good soup dumpling w  plenty of soup but if i wanted a more delicate dumpling  heck  even a dressed up dumpling  i'd come here  idk if i'd wait like everyone else did but i'm not writing this place off as for the service  it's slow  even on a tues  night when its not at its busiest  i guess i expect that from joe's as they're trying to hustle u in and out of the restaurant  but if you want more turnover  dude  nan shian  you gotta step it up  you're dumplings aren't worth the 30 min  wait 
been a long time customer for years now and today's visit just sealed the deal for me   for as long as i've been going to this place  i loved their tasteful yet expensive ($5 50 for just 6 pieces) soup dumplings  at first  i really didn't mind the pricing since their dumplings were the best i've had in nyc  i even gave their noodles and scallion pancakes a few tries after completely falling in love with this place however  today's experience was just absolutely horrible  i first walked in and noticed their expansion   wow finally! more tables for more customers for their great food! not!!!! the boss thought he'd be a smart greedy idiot   doubled the size of the restaurant  but did not hire any additional waitresses  first  i had to go grab the menus myself after waiting 10 minutes for the waitress to bring me the menu second  ordered my dumplings  waitress gave us a heads up it will be 35 minutes of wait  fine  whatever  i've done it before  thirty five minutes came and went  so we asked the status of our dumplings  the manager comes by and tells us it'll be another 10 minutes  by then  i ran out of patience as my quarters were running up in the meter  i decided to cancel after waiting almost one hour for my dumplings  not to mention  the tables around me ordered fried dumplings  they came out so burnt that the two tables had to tell them to take it back and remake or cancel order   this place has gone downhill since its expansion  burnt food  horrible customer service  one hour wait on dumplings  i will not be returning to this place as there are sooooooo many other places in flushing that i can spend my $$ at for those that "absolutely swear" by this place  bullshyt comes at $5 50 for 6 piece and an one hour wait  enjoy!
best soup dumplings!!! believe the hype  joe shanghai dumplings are much greasier  their soup dumplings are fresh from the steamer  packed with soup  and almost never broken  other great dishes  gluten tofu  hot bamboo shootsok dishes  rice noodle cake the restaurant's other dishes can't compete quality wise with their soup dumplings  super cheap too! beware of the long lines on weekends 
the soup dumpling were good but the rice cakes with beef was amazing   i also really enjoyed the scallion pancake with beef 
i used to go there all the time before they expanded to the current 3 stores restaurant  that time was the best that u always wait in the long line and then would have a satisfied feast  but now since they expanded  i went there again and felt everything was on a higher scale including the price of course as well as the sodium in the food  it's a way too salty!!! btw  i was grew up in shanghai so i'm definitely an expert talking about authentic shanghainese food  not worth a try 
i came here for lunch today as consolation to myself for having had the worst  most stressful morning  i came to flushing for the first time in like  5 years because of a job interview  and the freaking 7 train had to break down  causing me to be 30 minutes late  i almost gave myself a stroke on the platform  some crab soup dumplings were definitely in order i can certainly see why people are addicted to the soup dumplings here  there's an incredible amount of soup in them  even after i think i've finally sucked them dry after what seemed like forever  soup still comes pouring out from nowhere when i bite into them  it's like self regenerating soup  i don't know how they do it  it's just amazing  it took me like 30 minutes to eat 6 of these  which is how many you get per order however  in terms of flavor  i think the crab soup dumplings here aren't as good as the ones at lao shanghai in chinatown (aka shang hai cuisine on bayard & mulberry)  which still stands as my all time favorite after 27 years of non stop experimentation  the taste of crab is really lacking here  you can barely detect it  i think it might be a better deal to just get the regular ones and save a buck i also had the scallion pancakes and the spicy beef noodle soup  i know  other people were staring  especially after i licked off every pancake crumb on the plate and picked up the noodle bowl and drank the whole thing  these were the most deeply and crisply fried scallion pancakes ever  unfortunately  the taste of scallion was pretty much non existent (not unlike the taste of crab in the soup dumplings)  but the texture was incredible  super flaky on the outside  moist and chewy on the inside = yum  finger lickin' good  really  i did lick them  (of course i washed my hands thoroughly before feasting  as everyone should do in any asian eating establishment )the spicy beef noodle soup was very mediocre  not bad  but not particularly good  noodle soup is really not their specialty here  should've gone with the fried rice cakes instead  well  hopefully i get that job and will be back soon  if not  it'll be another 5 years probably before i get on the 7 train again 
soup dumplings are definitely legit here  the crab soup dumplings  imo  even better  the skin is not as thick as joe shanhai's  the wait can be long most times but worth it  not too expensive 
i will be coming back here on my next visit   soup dumplings were awesome as well as the green onion pancake with beef slices    )
just came back from a very satisfying breakfast at nan shian  i've been looking for a taiwanese northern chinese breakfast in new york for a while  and finally realized that there is none to be had in manhattan chinatown  nan shian definitely has all your craved foods on the menu  sweet and savory soy milk  you tiao  scallion pancakes  sticky rice rolls (fan tuan)  and  of course  soup dumplings the soup dumplings are superb and i can see why this place is known for them  the skin is unbelievably thin  and there is an entire soup spoonful (maybe more) of soup in each dumpling a review of everything else we ordered beef wrapped in scallion pancake  really hearty  every restaurant's scallion pancakes are different  nanxiang's are on the soft side  and somewhat fluffy  this dish is served with a shmear of plum sauce sweet soy milk and you tiao  it's fine  not the best i've had but decent red bean puff pastry  not to be confused with the red bean pancake  each order comes with four bite sized morsels  flaky and sweet chive box  i love chives  so i don't have anything bad to say about this dish pan fried pork buns (shen jian bao zi)  maybe this is because they came at the end  when we were all pretty stuffed  but i wasn't too impressed  some of the bottoms were too blackened  and they're really bread y cucumber and garlic  perfect palate cleanser for all the delicious fried goodness  this dish is from the cold case they have at the side of the restaurant atmosphere  nan shian is a fairly small restaurant  but it's very clean and newish looking  the hostess  like at all popular and crowded chinese restaurants  is a bit curt if you want to get a table without your entire party present  but she is also good with the advice  such as letting us know to order the soup dumplings first while we perused the rest of the menu  since they take some time to make  the service was actually pretty good and very attentive and i feared that by showing up the same day as the chinese new year parade  the restaurant wouldn't be able to accommodate us  but we came in at 10 45 a m   right when a couple of largish groups were leaving  so my friends and i (party of 5) were able to get a table with little problem and without feeling cramped at all 
from what i understand  this place recently expanded and i have proof that they have not worked out the kinks yet  the dumpling house is experiencing major growing pains and unfortunately  i was able to expereince if first hand the wait for a table was not bad  but it took over an hour for our xlb after we ordered to arrive  i also understand that they make the xlb to order    which i don't get  its the specialty of your gig  make a ton of them so as keep your customers coming back  the quailty of the xlb  once it finally arrived 1 hr 15 mins after we ordered  was good  i will venture to say it is comparable  or perhaps  even better than joe's  but not worth waiting an hour for  there are too many other xlb places i want to try   and until nan shian dumpling house gets their act together  i will not be back 
the wait was ridiculous for a sunday 2pm meal before heading to lga airport  the line was out the door and we were promised a ten minute wait that turned into 30 40 minutes  our group of 5 was split up into 2 groups that was eventually reunited at one table  after much confusion  the hostess was a bit rude under all the chaos in the front of the line  but regardless  the soup dumplings were still very enjoyable  we ordered each kind and there wasn't a single one that i didn't like  i was disappointed when i ordered some noodles to go and they tasted so bland that i would up only eating half the portion come for the soup dumplings if you have a lot of time to wait or if there happens to not be a line i almost missed my flight  but it was worth it (though it was not amazing enough that i would have actually missed my flight  you know what i mean) 
in 3 years this place expanded twice    so you know how good it is do not just try the soup dumplings  their soup noodles are also amazing be ready for a 20 to 30 min wait on the weekends  )
i recently visited this place with my mother and brother as an alternative to joe's  before a friend of mine recommended this place and me and since i was in the area and the yelp reviews were good  i decided to convince my mother to go we order 2 tiers of the crab + pork soup dumpling and it was all just downhill from there  i randomly got a plain pork bun in mine and my brother had what looked like crab shell plastic piece in his bun  they were flavorless and very tasteless  the soup inside the buns aren't nearly as good as joe's and their skin is slightly sweet we also ordered this bun with marinated beef and scallions  it's suppose to be on a toasted sesame bun but inside it was on a fried scallion pancake  there was 1 slice of meat and too much sauce  all in all it was gross beyond belief  conclusion   not amused 
love this place!  there is almost always a wait but it seems to move quickly   skin is thin and the dumplings are juicy   other dishes are just okay; i've gotten beef noodle soup and pork with preserved vegetable soup too   they tend to be on the blander side   the red bean pastries are very tiny and you only get 6 that are about the size of a big thumb   the rice wraps are also a little skimpy on the inside compared to other places i've tried   however  they get 5 stars purely for the amazing xiao long baos!  i usually am very picky about the crab ones and they do a great job with those xiao long baos too 
hands down! the best place to get shanghai soup dumplings in flushing    my parents took me to this place for dinner and i loved it  eventhough the restaurant is small  you know they mean business when the soup dumpling is being made right out of the nook behind the cashier  prepare to rub elbows with your neighbors since most likely you have to share tables  i would not bring more than 6 pp at a time to this place the noodles and rice cakes needs more meat    they only give you scraps of the meat in the dish  just come for the soup dumplings  thin skin  yummy hot soup inside    perfect consistency in my mouth  i'm salivating just writing this up  x 
excellent soup dumplings! you can taste how fresh they are   they are definitly a highlight of eating here  but they are not the only reason to eat there (i don't want anythign else when i go to joe's)  i really love the scallion noodles and the scallion pancakes  both with or without beef (excellent scallion pancakes are really tough to come by!) the rice cakes and other noodle dishes are tasty as well  as are the pork buns! i go quite frequently and am definitly pleased that they've opened up the space next door as well for more seating  even though it means maybe a longer wait for the xlb; the rest of the food comes out quickly  and you can get some cold dishes to help satiate your hunger 
i took some friends from work  and i thought the soup dumplings were great  all of my chinese friends kept telling me that joe shanghai wasn't that good  and i honestly did not have anything to gauge it by  the soup was perfect  not too greasy  and not too over powering  the other dishes were equally good  we had the vegetable dumplings  the scallion pancakes  a turnip dumpling and the crispy noodles with shredded chicken  if you like soup dumplings  i would highly recommend 
though it was a long wait (~40minutes)  the food was worth it   my friend and i were seated in between two other groups of people because the entire place was packed  and for good reason we got the beef noodles  scallion pancake with sliced beef  and soup dumplings   everything was very flavorful and the three dishes were very filling for both of us service was a bit lax due to the number of customers but our food came out fairly quickly   i wouldn't recommend it for large groups or dates  especially since you can't make reservations   however  those who can brave a long wait should definitely give this place a go!
dumplings come out late cause they need to dress up  the anticipation builds loneliness into a bear 
okay  this is now my 3rd trip and the joy of this place is waning for me   the xlb are decent but not amazing   i would still come if you're in the area but i certainly wouldn't go out of my way 
pretty good food  drab decor  and barely there service are to be expected of a restaurant in flushing chinatown  and this place is no exception  my father went with a meat and bean sauce over noodles  which he enjoyed  and my sister gobbled down a plate of shredded beef with peppers and rice  my brother's beef udon soup was plentiful and far too huge to finish  and i was overall disappointed with my homestyle spicy beancurd; it possessed a strange after taste  gummy mushrooms  and was literally drowned in sauce  however  cheap prices made it worth it 
if you like soup dumpings  come here forget about the other places such as joe shanghai  which is always crowded and overrated in my opinion  this is the one to be at! great overall food   clean and great fast service  here at nan xiang dumpling house   the prices are amazing and the quality of the food is simply outstanding  tried many dishes from the noodles to the scallion pancakes this is the place to have some authentic chinese food   the service may be a tid bit sluggish as their english isn't that great as common with most restaurants in the area   but the food quality and the value defeats it  and always makes me wanna come back here   i have came here and spent well under $25 and ate well with a group of friends  simply by far as good as it gets here in flushing  ny when it comes to chinese food   parking maybe a bit tricky but if your patient to wait for a spot across at the municipal come check this place out you don't wanna miss it!
finally found a restaurant with soup dumplings comparable to joe shanghai's   with that said  can't really say that the soup dumplings here are any better or worse than the ones at joe shanghai's  ordered the pork soup dumplings today and the scallion pancake with beef   like the ones at joe shanghai's  the soup dumplings here are made with relatively thin skin with just enough soup inside i really didn't care for the scallion pancake with beef   the pancake was fried well  but i couldn't really taste the scallions   i didn't really like the combination with the beef and hoison sauce   definitely prefer the scallion pancake at joe shanghai's more all in all  it was not a bad dining experience; although  tables are pretty crammed together here since the restaurant isn't enormous   will definitely come back again to try the pork & crab soup dumplings as well as some of the other popular dishes to get a more comprehensive taste for how the food is here overall 
the soup dumplings were very good imo  the service was pretty slow and they had no cold water   only hot water  wtf am i supposed to do with hot water?take a bath? other than that  the xiao long bao were what made the meal for me  the rest of the food we got(shanghai noodles  some pan fried dumplings) were only ok  i'd come here again just for the xiao long bao and skip the other stuff  the other cool thing is you actually get to watch them make the xiao long bao  also the prices are pretty good 
awesome fresh made and well worth the wait   i mean you gotta wait for these things   first there is that line of people out the door and then once you order  you gotta wait another 40 minutes for them to make the dumplings and steam em   dont bother orderign anythign else here   its really not worth the wait and just tastes average at best   just come for theose sweet juicy soup dumplings 
after only a 10 minute wait  considering the seemingly long line before us  we were seated  our stroller parked  highchair set up  and food started coming  one dish after another  as if we ordered a tasting menu at one of those fancy restaurants  crispy dough (our daughter's favorite)  spicy shrimp wontons  the famous steaming soup dumplings  pork and cabbage noodle soup    very tasty and satisfying and energizing and warming  giving us strength to set off through the neverending rain to the nearby marshall's 
wait time can be rather long (15 20+min) on weekends and during dinner hours (6pm onward)  and that's expected  but the waiting certainly doesn't take away from the delicious food  the pork soup dumplings are incredible  i order my own 6 every time i come here along with the pan fried pork buns  the pork and cabbage soup is very good  too  all noodle and appetizer dishes come out before the soup dumplings  but that's because they're being hand made right in front of everyone (i usually wait about 20 30 min  when it's busy for them to finally come out)  the wait and busy service may be a turn off for most people  but that does not take away from the quality of the food when it finally gets to the table  good food takes time  and no doubt this place has great food 
they have the greatest soup dumplings  a lot better and cheaper than joe's shanghai  and the wait time is a lot shorter than joe's shanghai     even thought their name is called "noodle house"  but their noodles are not that great  so i suggest trying anything but their noodles     their appetizers are great  too!
came here with a friend and fell in love  the soup dumplings are amazing  don't bring someone on a first date though  they'll enjoy the food but think you're a cheapskate  yummmm!
i make sure i come here once a month   love their crab dumplings   it's a shame the dumplings are the last items to come out even though i order them before sitting down!  the beef scallion pancakes is their version of peking duck   so delicious!  beef wrapped in scallion pancake with hoisin sauce and cucumbers is like a party in my mouth   also  i make sure to always order the shanghai flat noodles  theirs is less greasy than the ones at joe's    )
joe shanghai and all the other bootleg dumpling houses in the area pale in comparison to the nan shian dumpling house  granted it is a tiny place (25 30 heads max) and there can be a bit of a wait  but it is definitely worth it  if the winter blues have you down and out  the xiao long baos will cure what ails you  these soup dumplings are made to order  so be prepared to wait 15 20 minutes  this might seem like a long wait just for soup dumplings but once they arrive  you know it wasn't in vain  additional things to order while waiting for your dumplings to arrive; pan fried noodles with beef  shanghai fried udon noodles  scallion pancake filled with beef and hoisin sauce   and the turnip pastry  their soy bean milk (hot cold) tastes really fresh like it was made that morning  the xlbs come in the pork or crab variety and arrive in bamboo steamers lined with napa cabbage  and come with little tongs for picking up the soup dumplings  definitely the #1 place to try soup dumplings if your in the area
soup dumplings are very good here  the noodles are decent as well  haven't tried anything else 
i have to agree with the other reviewers  this place has awesome steamed pork bun dumplings! my parents took me to this place today  and although we had waited over 20 minutes  it was well worth it  we had the steamed pork bun dumplings  soybean drinks (sweet for me  salted for my aunts & mom)  rice cake noodles  fried crullers  sesame lotus bun things  and udon noodles   the rice cake noodle and udon noodles were pretty good  the sesame lotus bun thing  was just okay   i didn't particularly favor them  the fried crullers were a bit on the chewy side for me  but dipped in the soybean drink it was okay  but again  the steamed pork bun dumplings were the prized dish here! when looking at the buns  you can just see how soupy they are! picking them up every so delicately   afraid that it might pop before you can drink it  the skin was just perfect on these bad boys   it wasn't too thin where it would burst on you if you did pick it up  and it wasn't thick like other places  the soup inside was just ever so tasty  as it should be! not dry like other places  it was so good  even my aunts and mom ate the lettuce! (old school folks) if it wasn't such a long wait  this place would have gotten 5 stars  this place would be perfect if they expanded   they could fit maybe like 5 families at a time  be prepared to wait on the weekends and holidays!
used to be really good  think new owners has different ways to make the soup dumplings 
soup dumplings are good  comparable to joe's shanghai without as much of a wait  the rest of the menu also has a lot to offer  the pancake with the beef  the iced soybean milk (its sweetened)  the fried udon noodles and the rice cake with shredded chicken are very greasy but are pretty good too 
i'm a frequent customer and it was rumored that they had a major staff & chef change over the winter  the food is still ok but certainly not as good as before  the juice bun breaks more easily when you pick it up  noodle is now very salty and the scallion pancake is extremely oily  with all that said  i'll still go to this restaurant because i live close by  if you're coming in from the city just for this then i'll suggest you try something else  this used to be a 5 star but no more 
oh delicious steam dumplings!!! where have you been all my life??? your perfectly balanced flavor center  wrapped in your perfectly balance skin  you have created a special place in my gi tract i recently discover this place 3 days ago and so far i have eaten nothing but food from this place  i usually order take out because the restaurant is relatively small  there's always a wait or the option of sharing tables 
this is one of my favorite spots in flushing if you aren't looking for dim sum  i recommend the cold wheat gluten and the cold soy bean salad if you want something other than soup dumplings 
tiny tiny tiny space  but delicious food!the soup dumplings are quite good   i prefer the soup and pork inside the dumplings here than the fattier tasting one at joe's shanghai   the dumplings otherwise are shaped  sized and skinned very much like joe shanghai's i also tried the pickled veggie and shredded pork noodle soup   i love the noodles   they are silky and chewy and soooo delicious   there wasn't much pork and too much pickled veggie but i just really love the noodles!i was here on a sunday for lunch and it was certainly crowded indeed   there's definitely going to be a bit of a wait but the service is actually quite nice compared to your usual gruff chinatown types   they tend to run out of a lot of items pretty quickly so if you want to have the full experience of the menu  you might want to go early on the weekends 
i love this place  its a perfect place for breakfast  lunch and dinner! they have the best soup dumpling!  but everytime i came here theres always a line! but we get our seats with in 10mins  and i like the rice cake dish!
good food and dumpling  but wait why is it missing a start  well  you can see alot the waiter and waitress running around but no one really care about you        and no  it not because the tips  i always give min  of 4 dollars compare to others only give then 1 or 2 pop 
cold day   need soup dumplings   yum we went here to satisfy our grumbling bellies   the wait seemed a little long  but not too bad   (we stopped into white bear down the street while we waited   i can highly recommend this plan   for overeaters like us that is )  in any case we had the pork soup dumplings which were pretty dang good   definitely some of the best i have ever had   we also had an order of niengao (rice cakes) with pork and mushroom which was tasty as well   overall   taste awesome  friendliness not so much   but i go for the food not to make buddies 
excellent dumplings  beware of the wait   we waited nearly 50 minutes for our dumplings after ordering  make sure to order other small dishes 
the noodles with scallion sauce was out of this world! $3 50 and well worth a trip from manhattan 
pretty good soup dumplings  the essential supporting cast (savory soy bean milk  noodles  potstickers)    very very very very mediocre  the scallion pancakes are overfried and thus too oily 
this place sucks! came here with my bf for lunch one day and we are definitely not coming back even if they pay us   we ordered the jellyfish with turnips  two xiao long baos  and a plate of shanghai noodle  there's a reason why if you want great xiao long baos  joe shanghai is the place to go  the filling fell out of the skin the second i tried picking it up from the steamer  i thought maybe it was my fault  maybe i picked it up too fast  every one of them had the same problem and when i told the waitress that the juice was leaking onto the table  she had the nerve to say this is why you put the plate underneath the steamer  well  excuse me! you guys only gave us one plate to begin with and i didn't expect my xiao long bao to suck  the jellyfish had no flavor whatsoever and the turnip filled most of the plate  the noodle was the best out of everything we ordered  what a waste of money and time 
we were visiting ny in may 2010 and with recommendations from a local we discovered this magnificent establishment   mm mm mm! granted i'm no expert when it comes to xiao long bao but the ones i had here were like "droplets of heaven"   my husband who has been to hong kong agrees too   i could eat them all day long  in fact  everything we ate here was excellent   it was all made before your eyes once you order from the xlb's to the noodle dishes to the green onion pancakes   i can't wait to come back to downtown flushing for more  such simple dishes but made with fresh  quality ingredients which i feel is what distinguishes this place from others  undoubtedly  the best xlb's i've ever had the privilege of devouring  the service was fast and efficient which i like especially when i'm hungry i was so glad there was no wait when we arrived since it was an hour before our yankee's vs  mets game credit cards accepted! yeah! unlike most chinatown restaurants 
came here for the first time today and got both the crab xiao long bao and the pork xiao long bao  i was very unimpressed with the quality  with all the high ratings and positive reviews given for this place  we didn't expect to be served duds  the dumplings looked and tasted like they forgot to put in the filling  the skin on the dumplings also broke apart very easily  couldn't taste the soup either  i'm giving this 2 stars because the service was okay
camille and i had company  last saturday    a very good   friend of mine from the 80's joined  us on our weekly saturday sojoun       she  had originally called from virginia  a  couple of weeks ago where she was visitng with her brother's family and wished me a belated birthday and said that when she comes back   in new york that she would  treat me for a belated  lunch or dinner   we met around 3 00 for a late lunch   that was saturday  july 25      for the past 2 weeks    i  have been craving for some xiao long bao    those famous  shanghai soup dumplings      and i know exactly where to get them     nan shian dumpling house on prince street   in flushing  (chinatown in queens)   the specialty of  the house !!!   looks like a  cute little dumpling but conceals a meatball and a hot  soup within   as a cook myself     always wondered how it was made   did they fill it with syringes   just kidding   !!!!      the trick was  to pinch the dumpling dough around meat jelly carved from chilled  reduced  gelatinous stock   when the dumplings are steamed  the fillings melts into a rich soup    we ordered 2 steam baskets of those   comes  6 pcs on each  basket  $6 00  or $ 1 00 each   very affordable      it comes with a soy sauce  vinegar  and ginger  on the side    the broth was so good and the meatball  delectable    looking around    there are still some people who do not know how to eat it      so here's some pointers    again  ( i have it on my review on joe's shanghai)1   place dumpling in your soup spoon2   bite off the top of the dumpling    3  carefully sip the soup   careful not to get burned4  now go for the kill    ( the yummy part which is the crab pork meat )5  season it with the soysauce  vinegar and ginger mixture 6 savor every bite   these simple directions makes soup dumplings fun and easy to enjoy   we all ordered some noodles on the side   camille and eva had the seafoodnoodle soup   and i ordered the sauteed seaffod noodle with vegetables    whew    everything came in huge containers   we   hardly  couldn't finish it     the wait wasn't that bad    we were lucky to get in    in 15 minutes   the waitstaff was pleasant   and the turnover fast   i think i  like it there better there than joe'sshanghai    why?   the air is clean it's  not stuffy   its  cozy   neat  and the atmosphere   casually nice       i'll  certainly go back there again       for both their delicious food and the prices   you can't beat it       yuymmy!!!!!!!!!!    2        
rrrreeaally delicious soup dumplings   tender  savory  unusual  luscious   three of us ate and were happy for $25 00   a few notes for the clueless non chinese diner (like myself) to make this very worthwhile stop easier 1   actual name of restaurant is "nan xiang xiao long bao" on sign and menus et al   2   soup dumplings are not listed as such on menu  look under "shanghai's dim sum" section of menu  they are just listed as "steamed pork buns" or "steamed crab meat and pork buns"   3   if you also order some side dishes (recommended) and choose one of the types of rice cake (recommended by some other yelper)  be aware that rice cake looks something like stir fried slices of water chestnut or very large mushroom   i embarrassed myself by asking the manager where the rice was          oh  it was good  and i enjoyed it  once i was sure that i wasn't eating another table's order  4   monday night was a great time to eat out!  lots of parking and easy to get a table 
best soup dumplings in flushing much better than joes shanghai  simple menu  not too much stuff but the soup dumplings are enough to drop by and wait in line on the weekends 
definitely the best soup dumplings i've ever had   we usually get a rack (6 dumplings) per person   the noodle dishes are pretty good   the pork and shitake mushroom w crispy noodles  beef and rices cakes  or the pork and salted cabbage noodle soup hit the spot   4 5 stars  losing a half star for the spotty service  but the food makes up for it 
we love coming here   the dumplings are fresh and hot and full of flavor  the tofu salad is fresh and delicious as a vegetarian  i thought i wouldn't enjoy it as much as my carnivore boyfriend  but the veg  steamed dumplings are not your everyday veg  steamed dumplings   and the scallion pancake is ridiculous with that black vinegar   even the veg noodle soup is pretty good (nothing special mind you)  and $5 for 3 dinners' worth and the prices are awesome   we can't get here often enough 
if you want shanghai food and xiao long bao (soup dumplings or juicy buns)  this is the place to go in flushing  less crowded and less costly than joe's shanghai (and with better service)  i find my meals here to be quite enjoyable  comfy is the most appropriate word  the place is tiny  no more than 30 40 folks at a time  so be prepared for waits at peak times a tasty "breakfast" menu is available (think scallion pancakes  hot soy milk  crispy dough  and turnip cakes)  fried noodles and soup noodle dishes are available too but truly the stars of the meal are the soup dumplings (crab or pork)  get a table in the back and watch the chefs (three nimble fingered women) as they prepare mountains upon mountains of dumpling goodness  open up your steamer and smile at the sight of six dumplings filled with a lovely broth  enhance it with the generously supplied ginger rice vinegar sauce! mmmm    
lunch here was a disaster  mostly because for some reason i thought this was a dimsum place  still  i give it 3stars because the must have soup dumplings are just a ok  the bamboo shoots  fried noodles and scallion pancakes were good but not worth the 45min wait on sunday morning  on the bright side  a group of 6 ate until we were full and it was less than $20pp 
the dumplings are very good  but they a long time to come out  and if you ordered other dishes  chances are you will finish those before you get the dumplings  their other dishes are not quite as good as their dumplings  to me  most of their other dishes was too oily  so try to keep it light  the place is really small so be prepared to wait if you come during the weekends or dinner time 
last night in nyc and we settle on this dumpling place  the food here is totally worth the wait   so don't be scared away by the line     jelly fish + daikon   there was more daikon than jelly fish  made me kind of sad but it was still well pickled     the crab meat xlb here were a little taste of heaven  the skin wasn't too thin so that it'd break upon removal  and it wasn't super chewy  the soup had good strong flavors  the meat  tender  delicious  these take a while to prepare though so make sure you get your order in fast!   veggie dumplings  i needed to meet my vegetable quota for the meal  jk  it was tasty  but very normal dumplings     nien gao (seafood fried rice cake)  great texture  wasn't over cooked   it was everything i could have hoped for     scallion pancake + beef  yes  beef makes everything better  don't pass up on the red meat  its got a sauce and its wrapped like a sandwich for super yummy goodness 
legitimate xiao long bao here  guys    watch out for the dumpling squirts!
a cozy little place in flushing  i love how they make everything here tastes so goood  the soy milk drink and seafood noodle soup is the bomb  the xiao long bao tasted juicy  the only thing i find there that was lacking is a restroom  still i will definitely come back to try again 
what we ordered soup dumplings that were juicy and didn't burst scallion cake that was fluffypan friend dumplingsscallion cake & sliced beefbeef noodle soupwait time for seating was under 5 minutes on a sunday at around noon  food was good! the only thing i did not like was the beef noodle soup   but it probably was not the "beef noodle soup" i was looking for (niu ro mien)  but 3 stars only because it's in queens and i live in brooklyn 
food is good  service is decent  doesn't take reservations  so may have wait for a while 
good soup dumplings and good prices   the crab meat ones are only a dollar more  but there isn't that much crab meat   i still prefer joe shanghai for soup dumplings  but this is a good place to go to for if you are looking for a quick breakfast and have a craving for soy milk  fried cruellers  etc   don't expect good service   its a chinese "fast food" place   just enjoy the food and bug the waitresses until they finally give you what you want    aside from the soup dumplings  i usually get the salty soy milk  fried dumplings  scallion pancakes  fried crueller 
visiting my friends for just a short weekend  the one thing i needed to get was xiao long bao  they said they new exactly where to take me and i couldn't be more pleased!coming from san jose  ca  where the asian food is pretty good also  this place had a pretty high bar to beat already  soup dumplings were chock full of delicious soup and served piping hot!!! what we ordered    1 order pork soup dumplings   yes!!   2 orders of crab soup dumplings   yes yes!!   rice cake with beef   wontons in spicy sauce   scallion beef pancakethis small store had a line out the door by about 11am so get there early  don't expect stellar service  but do expect stellar food!!! i'll be back during my next trip to ny in october 
best xiao long bao i've ever had
well  after trying some of the hole in the wall eateries in flushing it was a pleasure to experience a nice restaurant with air conditioning and a clean environment   complimentary tea brought to the table immediately was a nice touch   you do need to wait for your food but it will arrive piping hot   of course i tried the soup dumplings   the 6 were more than i could handle for lunch and by the time i had #5 it was already getting cold and you need to eat these while they are hot   a very lovely chinese lady was sitting at the next table with her mother(?) and she became my advocate in the restaurant and made sure i received good service  we ordered at the same time and their food arrived a lot sooner than mine   she was more concerned than i was   the waiter explained that they got the last of the batch and i would be first when the next one was ready   although it was a pleasant experience and the other food served looked appetizing  i must say that the dumplings were not the best i've ever had and don't think i'd make a special trip for them   i have yet to become a fan of flushing chinese food  none of the places i've been to live up to their yelp raves   i'm happier with my neighborhood places 
this place has the best xiaolongbao (soup dumpling  ) i have ever tasted   i came here many times   the dumpling are made fresh by 2 persons in front of you    the skin is thin and yet strong enough to contain the soup inside the bun without leaking   i never had one with broken skin   since they are freshly made  there is a bit of the wait but it is worth every minute of it   i prefer the normal xiaolongbao here  not the one with crab (joe's shanghai has the best crab xiaolongbao)   the other item i like is shengjian bao (raw fried buns  )  which requires 20 min wait time as they also make this fresh 
i went to this place again yesterday and i ate too much because i could not help myself  the food is great  my friends and i always come to this place because it's never disappointing!  great "hon sau niu ro mien"   beef noodles in soup!!! mmmm it's yummy! the noodles are extra chewy and they compliment the soup perfectly   the other taiwanese dishes appetizers are good too   i've had the scallion pancakes  oyster pancake  and soybean milk with "yo tiao " this place is pretty small and it gets really busy between 11am  1pm  so if you go with more than 4 people  you may have to wait so that they can combine tables   it's worth the wait because the service is fast and the food is delicious 
love steamed dumplings and bean cart appetizer  you should order steamed dumplings earlier because it will take time to cook 
the service was friendly and nice   their pan fried pork bun is awesome    i throw in more stars this time since i did enjoy the service and the food   highly recommended 
the food is pretty good and cheap  i went with a huge group of people couldn't fit everyone but it was cool because we was starving and busying eating everything on sight   
good place for soup dumplings  i like how they keep their menu small and compact and most of the dishes are pretty solid in the taste department  there is usually a line especially on weekend mornings and afternoons  but it's well worth the wait 
excellent xlb however please note you will have to wait to get a seat and wait again for quite a while to get your order   you may also have to sit shoulder to shoulder with some people you don't know   therefore if you want great xlb and don't mind waiting or sitting uncomfortably  you should check this place out 
average food  unsanitary bathroom  soup dumpling is okay and the rest is below average  don't understand why people would wait for this restaurant  not worth my time     
been here a couple of times and awaiting to go back again  the xiao long baos were delectable and the prices are amazing compared to joes shanghai  however the one with the crab meat i still prefer joes more  but nonetheless  this place is good
okay dumplings and northern dim sum   for some reason  we keep coming back here and havent tried the other flushing dumpling places 
i came here for one reason   taiwanese breakfast so this review does not apply to dumplings   my husband is taiwanese and we've often had taiwanese breakfasts in taipei so we were excited when we saw they offered this in the menu   we ordered salty soy bean milk  pancake w beef and salty sticky rice   the soy was ok but lukewarm and the dried shrimps overpowered the flavor   the beef was wrapped in a shanghai scallion pancake instead of the traditional taiwanese wrap and the sticky rice was so dry it was hard to chew   the filling was non existent   when the waitress took down our order  she asked if we wanted pork buns and we said no   from there the service was pretty non existent   maybe b c we didnt order a lot or just didnt order what they expected   maybe the dumplings would have been the preferred choice but i wish they didnt offer a menu of cuisine that is mediocre 
the steamed pork buns are completely unmissable  they are like soup dumplings with the most incredible broth inside  didn't have to wait too long and although they took about 30 minutes to come out  totally worth it  i just wish i had ordered more!
places that are open late are a big thing for me currently   they say they are open to 11 30pm on weekdays   in my experience they sometimes tend to close earlier  but they are open until a decent time as people here have said  the service here is fair to average  and more towards the fair side   it is not horrible  but it is not great either we ordered shanghai dim sum    steamed crab meat and pork buns  shai mai  and steamed vegetable dumplings   i ordered udon noodles also i am used to the udon garbage you get at delis in manhattan during lunchtime   this udon was much  much better   it was my favorite thing there second best was the shu mai   i'm used to japanese shrimp shu mai  but the shanghai shumai  which i believe is pork  was good   it was very juicy  which was fine with me the steamed crab meat and pork buns were somewhere between edible and average   they were ok  but not great the steamed vegetable dumplings were not to my taste at all   we each had one  and left three on the plate since no one else wanted one this is in downtown flushing  not sure about the parking situation to get here   we parked a few blocks away and walked  we didn't spend that much time looking for a better spot 
my experience with this restaurant was weird  the first time was amazing the vegetarian dumplings were just amazing  even though i am not an vegetarian  the next day i came back to it restaurant and also brought some friends with me  the dumplings that we ordered weren't fully cooked  and we all had stomachache afterwards 
having been here on a sunday brunch tour with friends (we decided to hit multiple places because we couldn't decide what we all wanted)  we only ordered 2 things  the beef in scallion pancake and the soup dumplings  now everyone here is going to compare these to joe shanghai  so let's get to that right now  i prefer these  both are equally tasty and flavorful  why then? it's the right amount gelatin for me  for those who don't know  gelatin is what makes stew lip smackingly good  it's also a technique on how to make soup dumplings (so i've been told by almighty google when looking for a recipe)  too little and you can't construct a proper soup dumpling  too much and it almost has a glue like taste  i find this is just the right amount for me  also  they don't skimp on ginger in the soy sauce here  something i absolutely love with my dumplings  the beef in scallion pancake is also fried here as opposed to nan be hur  and honestly  that's also a matter of opinion and want at the time  want something crunchier? nan xiang  feel a bit like a soft wrap? nan be hur  i really would have to say it'll depend on my mood as to which is better for that  i have to come back to try more though as there's plenty left on the menu 
i like this place i don't know what accounts to be "good" shanghainese food and i don't even know if this is considered to be actual shanghainese food  but i do like the food   the seafood crispy [pan fried] noodles  a common cantonese dish  was large in portion and delicious for just $10  i really like the amounts of fish they had in the dish as well   the beef pancake was interesting  it was basically peking duck but with beef and a crispy outer shell  worth a try   the soy milk was good  i've had better but i like that this was homemade   the xiao long baos soup dumplings however  were a little bland in my opinion  at least compared to the ones i've had in the past  i'm not sure if that means it's more "healthier"  meaning less msg  but it is popular  however  both the pork and the pork & crabmeat one tasted the same to me    and for the price you're paying  you only get 6 soup dumplings whereas most places in chinatown give you 8  that might just be a flushing thing though     the cold dish appetizer  spicy beef & tripe  was good  i liked it  but definitely overpriced   and last  the seafood udon was exactly the same as the seafood crispy noodles  but instead of crispy noodles  its udon  it was average  i liked it  but i wouldn't say there was anything special to it  i know they serve pan fried udon in many shanghai restaurants  so again  i'm speaking as someone who doesn't know what's considered "good" shanghainese food despite little niches  overall  i like this place 
i guess i havent reviewed this place yet  i had the pork buns  crab meat buns  spicy beef tripe  seaweed & garlic  pig ear  bean curd with mixed vegetables  the buns were alright  they werent spectacular  i like the run of the mill hole in the wall kind of restaurant's better  they know how to make good food  i got some decent cold appetizer but they wouldnt let me mix 5 varieties in one plate  i only wanted a taste of everything  i ended up eating all the pig ears because my friend doesnt like it  the best appetizers that stood out from what i got were the cucumber  and the sweet bean curd and veggies 
this place rivals joe's shanghai  which used to be better imo  the soup dumplings are great  other foods are just so so  service can be better as well 
yeh  believe the hype  the soup dumplings are good  thin skinned and translucent almost  they pack a lot of soupy pork flavor that's better than joe's shanghai about 2 blocks away  i can only come here on weekends and it's always packed but for me  it's worth the wait to sit next to total strangers and eat soup dumplings  if you come here with only one other person  they'll seat your party of two with complete strangers but that's alright  make new friends or whatever   i tried a noodle dish with vegetables after having my allotment of dumplings at one visit  i don't even remember exactly what noodles i ordered but that was good too  generally however  i would only come here for the soup dumplings and eating anything else would be wasting stomach space 
as a shanghainess i think the dumpling is not delicious but this tastes better than the lumingchun   before the new chief was coming  the spicy beef noodle is nice yummy 
went there for the first time and i loved it   the service is not so great  but the food more then makes up for it had the crab and pork soup dumplings and the veggie dumplings   they were really good   also had the bean curd which is shredded thin  with mixed vegetable   it was good  but the only vegetable in it was cilantro   i would probably get it again though   i went on a sunday night so it wasn't too crowded    next time i want to try the fried udon  it looked really good   can't wait to go back!
i love the food here   don't expect great service though and always a wait if you go at a busy hour   the cold dishes are highly recommended  i always get the spicy beef and tripe  pig ear  and bamboo shoots   the scallion pancake with beef is really good too!  i love the broth of the soup dumplings (doesn't leave me super thirsty afterwards like joe's shanghai does   )   the noodle soups are great as well if soup dumplings don't fill you up   regardless of the waiting and inconsistent service i always come back because the food is too good!
god in heaven  soup dumplings such as these can't be had outside shanghai  good in a way i can't describe in words  it makes me want to quit my job and move back to ny just so i can be close to them  so damn good!
on a cold  winter day  you want to come here to warm up   their xiao long bao (soup dumplings) are amazing   perfectly soupy  they're chinese comfort food at its best   they also do a great pork chop noodle soup  which for under $5  comes with about 3 pork chops  bok choy  and enough noodles to feed a small family   note  you may not be able to order from their "breakfast" items list all day long (which is often sad when you're there for dinner)  but they almost always have the (1) scallion pancake with beef which they serve thinly coated with savory peking duck sauce  and (2) red bean puffs  which i always order to serve as dessert   flaky and rich  they're a happy ending to a happy meal 
for a shanghainese gal far far away from shanghai  this place gets as close as it gets to traditional shanghainese snacks   their xiaolongbao here are very good   in comparison to joe's shanghai the soup inside is not as greasy and heavy  which i prefer   the soup noodles and stir fried noodles here are all very good too   i had the the fish with preserved vegetables noodles and the soup was very delicately flavored  savory and light  just the way shanghainese noodles taste   the turnip crisp is the best dish here   these small crispy layered pastries are filled with a delicious blend of turnips and pork   one defining trait of shanghainese cooking is that they add sugar to all their dishes   i think for palates that are not used to this  the food here can taste a bit off   however if you're used to this then nan shian is about as good as it gets in new york 
heard alot about the place    decided to stop by while on vacation in nyc    soup dumplings is good stuff better than joe shanghai!! also ate their spicy beef appetizer   that made my day!! will definately come back if i am in ny again  d oh yea the fried bread thingy majigy is delish too
the little dragon buns are awesome!  you have to get it with the crab meat but if you're allergic to crab meat then i feel sorry for you! heh heh   make sure you order the buns as soon as you are seated since it can take a long time especially if the place it crowded   i think i have waited 20 30 minutes for the buns    i almost finished all my other food when the buns came out but it's soo delicious    it's worth the wait   the rest of the menu is quite tasty   the soup noodles all have good flavor but i like the pan fried noodles there   oh    you have try their like turnip puffs    it looks really plain but trust me    it's very tasty!  i do wish they add some rice dishes even if it's just fried rice or something 
awesome food  i guess this place is really popular but my friend and i stumbled upon it by chance a couple of months back after shopping at the asian market   we went back today and thankfully both times we were able to get seats without a wait  we've tried the dry noodle dishes  the scallion pancake  noodle soup and veggie dumplings  i wish i could try more stuff at once but the portions are so huge that we cannot really eat more  both times we ordered two different types of dumplings wontons and both times they forgot to bring one which is a little disappointing but it worked out for the best since we were really really stuffed and def  didn't need an extra dish  pretty fast service and nice clean atmosphere  it is a very very affordable place and most dishes are family size so definitely do not order a bunch of stuff at once   i am in love with the vegetarian dumplings  i love love the filling and am dying to find what's in there  please share!
amazingly delicious soup dumplings!  some of the best i've had in nyc   decent fried udon noodle too 
their soup dumplings are great! probably the best soup dumpings i have ever had in nyc  it's amazing how much soup they can fit inside the thin skin with the meat   their fried noodle dishes are very good as well   the service was quick and attentive   i guess it helps to be asian and speak mandarin  p   this place can get crowded on the weekends   the best times to go are between 11am and noon or after the lunch rush 
it's the best  xiao lng bao   their chinese onion pancake worth a try too  get there before 12 otherwise  expect to see the line   i went there around 11 45  waited 5 minutes for a table 
these were really soupy soup dumplings   i can't say i was a fan of the plain pork soup dumplings  but the crab and pork dumplings were quite delicious   if i find myself in flushing again  i'd just order the crab and pork dumplings 
mmm   the pork xiao long bao is so yummy   the skin is not as resilient as din tai fung (in ca) but the broth and pork inside makes up for it   the cold tofu mushroom dish  scallion pancake  and chive boxes are also very good   they come out piping hot and fresh   eating all these with a cold cup of homemade soybean milk makes it perfect   yum yum 
pork soup dumplings are awesome   i'm a huge fan of crab  but the crab  in the crab dumplings is just not good   stick with the pork only ones   by the way  these should come with instructions   you don't want to lose the soup  so take a bite off the top  suck the soup up  and eat the rest in a bite or two   awesome!
this place has some good tasting crabmeat xiao long bao  the regular xiao long bao is too much white pepper taste   i didnt try anything else cause i just went there to try the buns  definitely a great place to stop by but be prepared to wait the place is soooo small 
i only had the soup dumplings here    and they were good    better than joe shanghai and better than shanghai cafe in manhattan the skin is the right texture  the soup is not super greasy like joe's  and the meat    tastes like meat   like it comes apart  the soup dumps taste fresh and you can see the ladies making them in front of you     so you can catch them if they try to dig for a booger or scratch their a$$  then wrap the dumplings    potentially adding "special ingredients" 
while the soup dumplings are excellent  try the scallion noodles   they are my favorite dish from this place   the sauce and the fried scallions are on the bottom of the bowl  so be sure to flip the clump of noodles over and give it a good toss   you'll love it!!!!
i was there with family for dinner sometime in august 2009   we had ordered cold appetizers which included  cucumbers  seaweed strips  tofu strips and some type of tofu   we also shared pork chops (two pieces) with noodle soup   the noodles were very good and the noodles and the soup was not oily   usually at other places  the noodles are soggy or it is too hard   there noodles are just perfect!  the xiao long bao and the fried pork buns were amazing   i had to finish the meal with a cold soy milk   yummy to everything we had ordered that evening the restaurant is small and there was about a 30 minute wait for a table   even though there was a wait  it was worth it   i cant stop thinking of their food   yum!!!
the steam buns were great but the service was very poor  and it's always filled up with customers and you will have to share a table with others 
cold appetizers taste bland  fried noodle very greasy  the only thing i like from here is their soup dumpling and their beef noddle   service hit and miss   one waitress nice and the rest just plain ignorant  my worst experience   came at dinner time with my husband and my kids   crowd as usual   went to hostess table register to ask table for 3   he ( middle age guy   look like the owner ) just look the other way and ignore me   i ask 3 times and when i saw  a waitress pass by   i ask her table for 3   she immediately seat me ( what the hell with that ? )
honestly  i don't see what's so special about this place   the soup dumplings are good  but then again  i don't think they're different from soup dumplings i've had anywhere else    price is the same     their noodles (we had the salted cabbage pork and pork chop noodles) are good  but not anything tastebud popping   when i see the line for this place sometimes  it's an automatic turn off anyway   why wait in line when i could go down the street to taste of shanghai and have the same quality food?
well worth the wait  made on the spot  both the pork and crab xiao long bao were excellent  we ordered 6 orders of 6 for the 5 of us  and left full and happy  make sure you order enough 
yes to crab and pork soup dumpings (xiao long bao) and amazing red chili wontons (hong you chao shou) in peanut sesame paste  epitome of chinese soul food
really worth the hourlong train ride   best soup dumplings i've ever had 
poor service   but i remember worse years back   i just don't understand why the wait staff has  i mean  has to be so sullen all the time   the male staff seemed better at least a couple weeks ago  that's why i suggested to go back   the food is okay   last night i went with a small group of people all six of us   we ordered a shredded chicken over fried noodles   the dish came with plenty of straw mushrooms but there were not a shred of chicken   if there were some or even one shred of chicken i wouldn't bother to ask because in my mind i thought they made a mistake by giving us a vegetarian dish   but the woman waitress just shot back yes it's shredded chicken over fried noodles and quickly went away   then we asked the guy who took our order   he examined the dish thoroughly without saying a word and then just took the dish away   i mean what's wrong with these people   was i complaining there was not enough chicken  no  we were just politely asking if they gave us the right dish   there was absolutely no chicken  they made a mistake   yet they never ever say a word of sorry   where is the hospitality?  i would not go back for some time if ever 
ok  this restaurant rivals some of the best shanghainese restaurants in vancouver  bc!!!  so that's pretty darn good!  let me warn you that this style meal is carb heaven  so if you are on the adkins diet   go out the door   the soup dumplings are amazing (be careful when taking the first bite   the soup will burn your mouth  be sure not to spill any of the juicyness  take the first bite from the top  then pour a little bit of the ginger sauce inside    mmm   don't forget about the appetizers (cucumber  seaweed a little spicy in a good way  shredded tofu awesome!)   i was excited to see that we could order the salty sticky rice roll during dinner  though its typically a breakfast item!  the stir fried rice cake with shredded pork and shitake mushrooms was definitely a partay in my mouth   i wanted more please!!!  unfortunately i had to share  (  definitely worth trying everything on the menu   fyi  i've had better onion pancakes  however  its still pretty good here 
i had a spicy beef noodle soup  which was good  but not extraordinary  it wasn't that spicy  and while the broth was well seasoned  it could use some interesting spices or something else to make it more unique  there is better fare in flushing 
i only went here for the soup dumplings based upon other reviewers  and i can't say i was too impressed   when i read that this place was called "nanxiang "  i thought maybe it would be more similar to the shanghai soup dumplings than joe's shanghai   they aren't   the soup dumplings are large and soupy with thin but weak skin   real shanghai dumplings tend to be small  less soupy  with thin yet tight and strong skin   also  the soup is very tasty in shanghai   i'm sorry to say this but noodle house dumplings are far from home as their taste is like a bao tze with water   definitely lighter than joe's shanghai's soup  but joe's taste is still closer to home (though still a longshot from shanghai's true dumplings) 
the recently add more space  but there's still a waiting line outside at lunch and dinner time  despite the 3 5 service  the food here is fantastic and completely affordable!
the xiao lung bao here is    drums rolling    the best i have had on the east coast   i have tasted xiao lung bao at many places including joe's shanghai and i will tell you why i think these are the best   first they are always made fresh   you see these ladies that stand around and wrap them all day long   second it's the perfect wrap to filling ratio  not too big  not too small   the wrapper is just thick enough so the dumplings don't break when you pick them up and just thin enough that it's not over powering your experience   the filling   i have only ordered the crab pork variety here   is just right  not too greasy  so tasty and delicious   the soup is plentiful and not sticky like that at joe's shanghai   it doesn't hurt when you get your dumplings they are always hot off the steamer and just oh such a wonderful experience   the other dishes are good  but not exceptional   services is so so typical simple chinese restaurant   i would go all the way out to flushing just to tasty these wonderful xiao lung bao 
this place is great   the dumpling (shao long bao) are made to order   so it's none of the frozen stuff you get in the other places   the stir fry rice cakes are great too   they also have fresh soy milk  rice rolls (fan tuan)  and fresh noodles 
if you are looking for soup dumplings  this is a very good choice   i came here with a friend of mine and we ordered one order of normal pork soup dumplings  an order of pork and crab soup dumplings  the pork chop noodle soup  and the 5 spice beef wrapped in scallion pancake   the scallion pancake beef wrap  a favorite dish that i've had many times in different restaurants  was good but nothing spectacular  as the ratio of pancake to beef was around 4 1 and the pancake consistency was chewier than i would've liked with less crispiness on the outside (honestly  it was more like half scallion pancake and half xao bing)   the noodles were excellent in consistency  the soup broth was delicate but still decently flavorful; unfortunately the pork chops were served in the soup so they did not preserve the crispy goodness of having just come out of the fryer  but were seasoned well   lastly  the soup dumplings were very good to excellent  not too greasy with good flavor  i think actually better than the ones i've had at din tai fung in arcadia   prepare to be seated next to strangers and bring cash since plastic is not accepted  overall  a solid choice for soup dumplings 
love their soupy dumplings & pork chop noodle soup!  they recently purchased the area next door  so no more lines 
yummy soupy bons  chinese name nan xiang xiao long bao
a great place for shanghainese breakfast  they have dou jiang (hot soybean milk  salty or sweet)  youtiao (chinese doughnut  fried crueller)  ci fan tuan (sticky rice burrito with youtiao and rousong)  and of course  xiao long bao (soup dumplings)  i agree with another reviewer that it can't compare to what you can find in shanghai  but it's the best so far that i've had in new york 
i finally found soup dumplings better than the over expensive  tourist laden  joe's shanghai =)   the dumplings had just the right amount of skin and soup and tasted amazing   not to mention most things in the place go for under $7 including the shanghai pan fried noodles and the portions are huge   i need to come back here to try their breakfast items  sweet soy bean milk and crispy dough    yumm
xiao long bao were good  spicy pork slices with tripe was also very good  would come back again and try the other dishes 
this is the most authentic shanghainese restaurant i've been to in new york  i love the scallion noodles and turnip buns (not sure what they're really called in english  "luo buo shi bing")  and everyone loves the soup dumplings (i don't eat meat so i can't say!)  i take my shanghainese family here when they visit and they love it  tastes just like shanghai  but less greasy!
so i went to nan shian dumpling house (aka noodle house) for lunch and wasn't too impressed with the food here  got the cucumber w garlic and bamboo shoots as cold appetizers  both didn't have much flavor  we ordered 3 baskets of plain dumplings  took awhile for them to steam it  when it came  we discovered it was the crabmeat dumplings  pointed this out to the waitress who replied  it's only a dollar difference per basket  excuse me but that's not the point  we didn't order this  instead of saying sorry or changing it to plain  you make it sound like we're being cheap  well  then why don't you take $3 off our bill? oh but of course not  she insisted we ordered the wrong dumplings  whatever  the dumplings are good though  seems to have more meat that joe shanghai  the sweet cold soybean milk barely had any soybean flavor  felt like i was drinking mostly sugar water  i'd go back next time and order different dishes and make the waitress repeat the order back to me 
this is the best soup dumpling outside shanghai   it really is   my family is from that region  and we have been looking for good soup dumplings for a long time   we've tried joe's and that place is god awful   this gem of a restaurant has the juiciest soup dumping ever   that little dumpling will over a chinese spoonful of liquid   the meat is very tender and tasty  and the soup is succulent  and not greasy   i just love this place   the other items are very good as well  scallion pancake  beef noodle soup  the scallion noodles and rice cake   the wait is the only drawback  as it's long!  the place is tiny  maybe 30 people and often there is a line of people waiting outside at any given time   i recommend going there early on the weekends  like at 10 30 when it opens   everyone i've ever taken to this place  tells me after they've tried their first dumping  'wow that was yummy!'   enuff said 
as close as i've ever gotten to rice noodle soup that evokes my home province yunnan  the flavor profile of guizhou is decidedly more sour but i love it  i'm incredibly lucky to have this affordable almost taste of home on my block and eat here often  for anyone who's never been  just know you can ask for both rice and traditional noodles  the latter takes longer  also  you can specify spicy or not spicy and even no cilantro etc 
no service  when we make order  the owner looks like someone own her a lot money  and even made order wrong twice  fine  the worth thing is when i stand from of  the counter ask for a soda  she just keep playing her phone and after i asked more than 3 times  she told me  take it from refrigerator by myself  tasty really bad  noodle cook too long  that tast too soft  the worst chinese food even in flushing area on the photo can figure out there no one stand by the counter during lunch time 
short and simple menu but i wish the english was translated better instead of having terms you'd have to go it's not as spicy as you'd think perfect balance of meat and flavors 
was just around the area to find something to eat for lunch on sunday around 12pm  i was hungry and i saw this newly design restaurant   i thought they renovated the old restaurant  i walked in and found out that this is a new restaurant and the previous dumpling shop was out of business  there were only 4 rectangular tables and 2 other tables on the glass window  the menus was displayed on the screen on top of the counter  i was expecting to be very busy but there were only 2 costumers  i guess this is too far away from main st and no one want to travel all the way here to try it unless it is extraordinary  beside there are couple similar restaurants around the main st  this place is self serve so don't expect too much from the servers  i ordered the beef mifen (direct translate rice noodles)  it was good  the price on the menus is tax included and my beef mifen came out to be $7 99  the general construction of their noodle soup is noodle with sour cabbage and sour daikon and the meat(depend on which one you order)  the favor of the soup is a bit bland so i added their spice on the table  just an reminder  don't put too much random stuff when you don't know what is it  i learn it a hard way and put too much of their spice then my tongue got numb  overall it was okay  i will come here again if i am around the area 
food  3 5 5 0service  2 0 5 0value  3 5 5 0decor  2 0 5 0overall  3 5 5 0 good guizhou noodle spot in flushing   there are a few in the area including in some of the local food halls  but i think this one is probably the best   note that the food experience can be slightly off depending on who's working    ie  whether they'll flavor it for you to leave it up to you   don't expect too much on the service side 
my favorite dish here is probably the mutton with the skin vermicelli  followed by the stewed beef as a close second  the soup has a tanginess that really cuts through the fattiness of the mutton and ughhhhhh i'm drooling just thinking about it  if it's your first time trying guizhou noodles  get the vermicelli as it's chewier than regular rice vermicelli  and stick with either the regular mutton or the beef  as the pickled pepper red sour soups might be sour overload  if you enjoy tripe  their braised tripe is also really good  since they add that spicy sauce to it  if only the restaurant was closer to the station  i would go there every week for sure  ps  the mutton has bones in it  if you don't like bones  don't get it  personally i love eating meat off the bone but whatever floats your boat 
this is definitely the my new favorite spot in flushing  i was drove to flushing to visit my friend and it was so late  i saw a newly renovated place and it kind of stand out in that street  the owner recommended the beef mifen and sesame pancake  i was soooo gooood  the beef was very tender and chewy  the broth was well balanced between just the right amount of sourness and spiciness  to be honest   i was never a big fan of mifen  after trying that dish i changed my mind i also gave the owner five star as well since he is supper nice and explained the ingredients to me very patiently  highly recommended! definitely go there try out the tons of flavor mifen!
i have eaten here are 4 5times  it was always really good until the last time i went  the order was too salty  then when i went back to tell them  they told me that i should've told me to not make it so salty  if you want us to do that  you should definitely put that on the menu  honestly  the first few times were so good and i ordered the same thing as i did for the last order  so  i just thought the taste would have been the same too 
i think they just opened few months ago  the store is very clean and the atmosphere is very cozy  the most popular menu is beef mifen  but i also like their lamb w skin mifen  their sour & spicy sauce is also very unique and delicious 
newly opened! soup is very tasty  and there are a lot of choices  there aren't many seats  but it's very clean and cozy  price is also good  very cheap with good portion 
new york i have eaten the best beef meal  shopkeeper is also handsome  he is always smiling and offering you the most intimate service living in new york can also eat the taste of home
the flavors of the noodle soup are perfect with a healthy serving size that easily fills you up  it is nice to see a constant stream of local customers that come in for takeout or sit in while i am enjoying a large bowl of beef noodle soup  confirms for me that everyone who have tried their soups end up being repeat customers 
i went here with my wife   i had the spicy sour beef soup  she had the lamb   both we're delicious   very affordable   i thought the environment was a little off  and the guy at the counter was a bit quick with me   but overall a good lunch spot 
they make crazy good noodles  my personal favorite is beef offal vermicelli  i come all the way from manhattan to eat this awesome dish  and this food is completely foreign to me(i am korean not chinese(guizhou))  when my chinese girlfriend introduced me this noodle  my mind blew and instantly fell in love with it  i hope they deliver to the city more often 
this is my go to place now when i work late   their beef noodle is very good  especially like the beef  very tender 
best mifen i've ever had  will definitely recommend friends to try this  really appreciate we have such a decent dinning place in the neighborhood 
i have loved this place since it first opened but the brunch i had today is driving me to write one of my first ever reviews  i had the caprese avocado toast and it was sooo delicious! honestly  i must have told my husband a dozen times how much i liked it while i was eating it  the burger is top notch and i've also very much enjoyed the rachel and the texas club  the decor is just my style and the employees there are always nice  keep up the great work!
amazing  cute little deli up the road from my new job  pleasant staff  clean restaurant  i ordered the ham and cheese and it was huge!! it was also delicious!! their potato salad is so good  except it comes in a tiny ramekin and is nowhere near enough to compliment the sandwich  the price was good too  less than $12 including tip  i don't usually love dijon mustard  but theirs was great  they used just the right amount  i can't wait to check out the rest of their menu  i heard great things about their burgers   
came here after the dripping with taste fest in search of some filling food  i chose this place because i saw they had a reuben and i am all about a good reuben   sadly  the reuben here did not deliver  it was ok  but for being a deli style restaurant  it was definitely lacking  firstly  there was barely any meat  they do have an nyc option for the reuben  but the regular reuben is listed at 5oz of meat (which in my experience is usually plenty  but did not seem like the amount i got on my visit) and for $12 75 there should have been more heft than the skinny sad little reuben that i was served  what meat there was was good  but because there was so little  the dressing overpowered it and it just was not what i was looking to satisfy my craving  i got the spicy version  which was flavorful  but again  there was not enough to really enjoy  the red potato salad that came with was also a bit dry and bland   maybe it was because we came a little before closing? not sure  i probably should have gone w the slaw for $16 w tax  tip  and drink  i have to say it was a bit overpriced  but  the restaurant itself was cute and the owner server was very nice update  the owner did kindly reach out and because of his graciousness i am willing to give the reuben here another go  especially since the beef used is locally sourced and pasture raised!
we ate there today for the second time and chose it because of their known brunch menu  although everyone was  more or less  pleased with their menu choices  we had to ask twice for them to refill the coffee urn  their salmon  cured on site   is their signature item  and it's really good but rather pricey   very casual  order at counter  and not many tables; so there may be a wait  the owner doesn't take well to suggestions  either  as evidenced by the owner caustically confronting me for my review  as well as other people we know who have had negative experiences with him 
this place is crazy good  best lox and bagel i've ever had (that's saying a lot considering i just got back from nyc)  i had the salad and added lox  my family had lox bagel and pesto and can't stop talking about it  my daughter housed her lox and bagel 
amazing again! everything we ordered from brunch menu was devoured   avocado toast is a full meal with a duck egg on top  bacon mac and cheese served with an egg too 
tried this place for breakfast when coming home from camping a couple of months ago and was highly impressed by the options on the menu  i had the #18 bagel with egg & cheese  and it was super fresh and tasty  if you're adventurous you may be up for trying some of the other options on their menu  they offer lox  capote caper  pole caught american albacore  etc clean establishment  worth checking out! they deserve bonus points for their order online feature 
food is very fresh and very tasty  good choices and nice size meals  really liked it a lot!
yes i agree the food is pretty good but man this place ain't cheap  finally got a chance to stop in and try their famous reuben sandwich  it was tasty but i don't think it was worth the almost $13 for it  they give you a puny side of fairly bland potato salad with it which didn't help at all  the wife only wanted the chicken noodle soup which she loved  seemed home cooked with quality ingredients  that's all we ordered so with 1 sandwich  1 cup of soup and a small scoop of potato salad it was over $20 with no drinks and tip  seemed pricey to me for so little food  we'll probably go back to try their salads and other sandwiches but honestly i was expecting more from this place 
my lovely lady and i stopped by for a late snack  we were greeted by a friendly staff in the rather stark restaurant white wine selection  by the glass  is pretty atrocious  but the french dip was pretty good  she liked her soup  whatever it was  but the burger  while tiny (larger than a slider  but not by much) was out  freaking  standing  one of the best patties one can find  not a ton of options but an excellent  tiny burger makes up for a lot 
the bagels are outstanding  they come in plain  sesame and everything  the cream cheese is plain or they'll cut up some scallions in it if you want  i wouldn't exactly compare this to wholy bagel because there are not a million bagel and cream cheese options  this is more of a lunch spot  i wish they were open earlier in the morning  but i need to accept that this isn't an early morning bagel shop  the service is always top notch  if you like lox  this is the place to get it  i doubt there's better lox in town  i'm looking forward to trying the reuben next time i go  if you have a hankering for a good bagel and lox  definitely give it a try!
had the blt with fig jam   really good  clean and nice atmosphere  only complaint was the boss(owner?) came out from behind the counter to reprimand the wait staff   not cool!
wow  a real  honest to goodness ny style deli right here in    darn  dripping springs     it's worth the drive folks and honestly not far out of oak hill   gorgeous space with great energy  lots of "cute" but no hipster  love that   we were greeted by a darling strawberry blonde  and her recommendation of the lox and bagel makes her my new best friend   i ate 3 hours ago  and i'm ready for another   from "real" bagel dough shipped from nj  they make bagels daily  in house   the proprietor smokes the meats himself  including the incredible lox!  i'm always careful about bread  so i tried to eat only the top part of my everything bagel  scraping the insides onto one side  pizza style   i found myself going back for bite after bite  however   addicted  the hubby tried the eggs benedict and pronounced it yum   the poached eggs were spot on perfect; a thing of beauty    we'll go back for reuben's and beer wine  they have a great list of both  as well as take out roast chicken  sides and pastas   we hope they expand into s austin!
for great food and service that never disappoints  this place it at the top of our list! when traveling we go out of our way to make a stop here and have lunch  and as always our eyes are bigger than our bellies! not to mention the bacon and smoked mackerel we purchase to take home )  we respect places such as this that take pride in what they serve and how they serve it  can't wait to have lunch here again!!!!!
so many words to describe this place  amazing  delicious  outstanding    i could go on but let's get to the heart of it the food is amazing  fresh and the staff here is great! this is my normal sunday spot  i love the patio outside so quiet  i enjoy getting away from the austin rush of things and just relaxing and really enjoying my breakfast or lunch  you can always find the owner here  wich shows true passion 
we love lox box and barrel! my favorite for lunch is the blt add avocado and their soups are always delicious   yesterday was the first time we visited for breakfast and it was amazing i had  egg plate with avocado and potatoes and a bagel   the bagel is served hot and delicious and so is everything else   the owners and staff are always personable and the restaurant is always clean    i love the decor tooi recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a great meal either to dine in or carry out 
they do not take call in phone orders  this is super inconvenient since this is a place that you would go to on the way to a destination since there aren't many anchor businesses around them  placing an order online while driving is really dangerous especially if you are already on 290 where 4 people just died in a car accident on mother's day  i needed to place an order for 5 breakfast sandwiches for my boss and wasn't able to make the deadline because their online system actually cuts off before their posted breakfast end times  i'm currently now waiting  been waiting for 10 minutes so far  for lunch sandwiches that i had to order when i arrived because of their system  i think they have a few more logistical kinks to work out 
a great place to get the finest deli  any pick from the menu will be a great experience  their style is fresh and cozy  makes you feel like you're eating over your best friend's house where you can have a great chat while having an awesome meal  every bite is a delight  a very smart choice from this business is the use of local products which makes the final results be incredible fresh and tasty  the place is very clean and the staff is just unbelievable  great overall service  can't wait for my next visit!  )
delicious  everything we had was fantastic  we were just traveling through and happened upon it and were wonderfully surprised!
hands down    five stars    i've been on the hunt for good deli (real deli) for a long time   let's face it  we have few deli's in town that truly are a deli  by other than texas standards   lbb managed to not only nail it  but added a texas flair i arrived later in the afternoon today  with a friend date   and we both ordered the reuben (spicy)   we ordered the smaller version (as they also offer the new yorker for those that want the oversize deli sandwich)   this proved to be the perfect size for both of us (we each ordered our own)   i also ordered a side (double side) of bacon   when i read that the restaurant smokes their own lox  bacon and corned beef   we just had to add it   glad we did   the bacon is uniquely flavored and absolutely decadently perfect   next time  i will try the blt   the reuben came on a marbled rye and the bread was fantastic   i also want to note  we didn't see one sign of pepsico or coca cola products   rather  they use a local soda company featuring cane sugar and natural flavorings   sure sugar soda company out of austin   i tried the cola and it was a pleasure the sandwhich came with their own house made pickles and chips   not too much and not too little the service was exemplary given you order at a counter  they not only bring your order to the table  they follow up without being intrusive   i have to say  this place is worthy of a visit and will become a regular for me i look forward to working through their menu as many items caught my eye   i noticed a table near us ordered a greek salad  and i almost regretted my choice as the salad also look great 
we ate at lox  box and barrel for the second time  our first meals there were bagels and they rated four stars  we decided to spend for the pricey reuben and beef au jus for the most recent visit  the corn beef or pastrami on the rueben was super salty and parts of it were tough and hard to chew  the sauerkraut was so full of water that the bread was soggy on the bottom slice and a pool of fluid lay on the plate  suggest the chef press the water out of the sauerkraut before placing it on the sandwich  i am sorry we did not march this sandwich to the manager for credit  the roast beef au jus was totally unremarkable  the bread lacked character and the gravy and beef had little seasoning and very little flavor  this was a bland sandwich  the staff was welcoming  service was top notch  restaurant interior was pleasing  location is tough to get into from highway 290 if driving westbound and having to cross oncoming traffic  note  the owner truly cares about this business and offered to refund price paid  but  i have to turn down his offer because we did consume the food  we'll try lox box and barrel again and will let the owner know right away if food has a problem 
a group of friends and i really enjoyed this place after spending the day at the deep eddy vodka distillery  the restaurant was dead quiet without any other customers besides our group (due to the time we went in) and it was great! the menu offered lots of different options and flavors with sandwiches  breakfast items  and great fresh sides  everyone in our group loved their meals and raved over the great mix of flavors and presentation of the food itself  my favorite part was the meal i ordered was a foodsharing meal meaning that they donated a meal to a youth in need with my purchase  i also got a little card with my order thanking me and letting me know it was seed paper and could be planted  it may sound cheesy but i love little quirks like that! i would recommend for sure if you're looking for a tasty lunch spot 
note to the business  if you are going to force customers to orders "to go" for the last half hour of the business being open  advertise this on your operating hours  the employees there were rude in telling my party that we were not allowed to eat in the restaurant because we arrived during the last half hour of the business' operating hours for an analogy  most fast food restaurants display hours when their dining area is closed and their drive thru is the only area open  the dining area will be open until the closing hour  and customers who are in the dining area past closing time could remain in the dining area until they are done with their meal  this business could take some note of this  and operate their business in a similar way needless to say  i didn't order any of their food due to their attitude leaving a bad taste for food i haven't even ordered yet  it's amazing how bad customer service can immediately make food taste bad when it hasn't even been made yet *edit after the business page owner posted the following response (in case it somehow disappears) "we do not have policy of forcing customers to do anything  if you show up 10 minutes before closing we politely inform you that the restaurant closes in 10 minutes  if you are immediately rude to the staff in any establishment i doubt they would show you any courtesy either "   the business page's owner's response proves my point  what the business page owner here stated would happen didn't  i'm the customer  and this was my experience  i wasn't rude to the staff; i just walked out after they told me they would only serve food "to go" half an hour before closing  the fact that the business page owner seems to be accusing me of being rude to the staff is rather disturbing  and seems to be a method to twist this review into something that it is not  thanks for reading 
this place is epic  not just because of the food (probably the best lox i've ever had) but because of their service  i'm used to eating lox or sushi and all kinds of other non pregnancy foods when i wasn't pregnant and it's hard to quit cold just because i got pregnant!! but the owner here and the staff offered to make me heated lox which is safe for pregnant women and gave me so many other options  they are super patient  their menu is also super extensive and diverse so there's really something for everyone here  even if lox isn't your thing  if i could give 10 stars i would!!
when i'm in the area  i love stopping in for a sandwich  i'm a sucker for their roast beef with cheddar on a baguette     i'm a sucker for any good roast beef and cheddar sandwich  but theirs has a nice kick with wasabi mayo  they use quality ingredients and i'll definitely be back whenever in the area 
after 4 visits i felt it was time   could one possibly eat more lox in one week?  the #17 has been in my dreams since first discovering   each subsequent visit brings me to the same meal and i cannot get past this   help!  why would i change perfection?  the combo of the flavors is just what the doctor orders  the location on my way in and out of town  the great staff  i could go on!  thank you for keeping it local  keeping it delicious  and something different  not mexican food (you can only eat that 6 days a week)  pizza  etc   expensive?  i am worth it   you can tell the quality   i don't have to drive to austin  yay!   any naysayers are spoiled brats! go back to mcd's and get your #1 or #2 and shut up 
it was ok  i ordered a salad with green goddess dressing  but it was not green goddess  we ordered my grandson a grilled cheese which he would not eat  we tasted it and it was burned  i think it is over priced  it was $34 for lunch for my daughter & 2 year old grandson and we had water to drink  my daughter got a sandwich which was to be served with chips & a pickle  they did not come with her order so she asked for them and got maybe 10 little broken chips on a plate and still no pickle i was not impressed  but my daughter ate there about a week ago and said it was great  so maybe a bad day 
this place is awesome! it's a very farm to table establishment  and everything is super fresh  i recommend the roast beef sandwich  it's the best i've ever had 
we come here almost every monday  every time great service  great people  and most of all the food is amazing  the hamburgers are really good  sometimes they run out of you don't get there early enough  the daves insanity sauce is great  just um   watch your pour  shits dangerous  the mr gets the rueben every time but we got the turkey and hot damn that was not expected  totally amazing  i still love the lox sandwich  it's worth it! i highly recommend them if you are in the area  and they have a really great team that works there 
as a native new englander intimately familiar with nyc bagels  i was delighted by this clean  cool bagel joint  the staff were very nice and helpful  and the made to order food was delicious  although they have limited bagel flavor options (you are not going to find a "sourdough pumpkin bagel" here)  they've got the standbys that most people are looking for anyway  we'll be back 
this is one of the best sandwich shops around! fresh ingredients  house cured lox amazing!staff is great they take pride in what they serve!definitely a good place to get a beer and a great sandwich!
sandwiches are amazing but the salad was meh  had the cesar with chicken  the chicken didn't taste fresh as if it had been cooked the day before  this probably wouldn't bother most but i can't stand reheatedchicken  i'll just stick to the sandwiches but go less becasue carbs and my 40's don't get along 
i've only been once so far but i thought the reuben was great  i can't wait to try the bagels 
what kind of lox and bagels place doesn't open until 10   good food but weird hours hence my 2star review
just had an amazing breakfast for a very reasonable price  great value!! added lox to my breakfast plate and it was delicious  stop here on your way out to wine country and get a good base before a fun day!!
there may be a couple of ins and outs to this new ish place  but i can't help but give a full 5 stars for their thoughtfully chosen ingredients and straightforward  yet unique menu first time going i thought the club was a good bet   the "texas clubhouse" has flavorful smoked bacon  amazing (house made?) mayonnaise  great cheddar cheese and bright fresh veggies   it's amazing   i don't usually eat jalapenos  but the ones on here were sweet and just right spicy a little bready  but a nice fair serving  only other complaint  a proper side of chips would be a nice touch for a $11+ sandwich *get extra pickles   this was the best pickle spear i've ever eaten 
this is a great place  fresh  great flavors local  don't miss the house cured items  but  occasionally the owner does impromptu dinners  watch facebook  i started with a salad that had tomatoes  summer strawberries  mozzarella  greens  and a vinaigrette  the first bite was lettuce  i actually said "wow" out loud  who the heck says wow when they eat lettuce? and then feels compelled to write about it?i guess i do 
um  wow  we stumbled across this deli while house hunting  i am so glad we did! real new york style deli with absolutely delicious food  the menu had a large selection  including multiple types of lox  we tried two different lox bagels and both were fabulous  they also have a nice kids menu and brought our son's fruit out first  which was nice  we ordered at the counter and received our food very quickly  the desserts looked divine   will have to try them next time 
we ordered a club  bagel with cream cheese  onion & tomato and a french dip  all were delicious  nice atmosphere and good service  we will be back 
love  love  love this place! it's a great deli and we love to go there for brunch  my favorite is the breuben  which is house made corned beef  sauerkraut  scrambled eggs  swiss cheese and russian dressing on a bagel  it is delicious  i would highly recommend this deli to anyone 
love this place and the quality of their food  i'm obsessed with the lox and goat cheese sandwich  it's so delish! also  if you ever get the chance to have the savory bread pudding  it's out of this world   brunch special  not on menu 
black friday in the hill country outside of austin  wanted to get a pieous pie  but they took off  their loss  our gain as we stumbled on lox  box & barrel! a delightful little sandwich shop with truly phenomenal lox and bagel  just delicious and chameleon cold brew  what's not to love?
great food  can't wait to come back  want to eat it all  i need a bigger stomach had the turkey pastrami and the bagel and lox  the bread on the sandwich was crazy good and want to try it on the corned beef  would be great to have a side of all those great pickled veggies 
been here a few times and each time i am disappointed  they are overpriced  i got a chicken ceaser salad and there were 3 small strips of chicken  and it was a $3 add on charge for the chicken  i don't care if it is free range chicken or organic chicken  that is a rip off! their coffee is good though 
always passed by this place when heading in out of dripping springs  it's inconspicuously hidden on the corner of a small shopping center and can be easily skipped if you're not placing close attention  however  if you do remember where it is and have an appetite  i'd highly recommend it! the sandwich was amazing and the homemade kettle chips & homemade pickle spears were addicting  awesome  tasty & legit little joint 
my first visit here as it is a little off the beaten path    first off  the good    i came in around 2 pm and was greeted right away  the staff is friendly and my order arrived in less than five minutes   the place is cute inside and i love the fact that it's local and has a farm feel   anyway  i ordered the cheddar bacon burger and was slightly above average   the bun and bacon were good but the burger was below average mainly because it was fatty and sub par quality meat   i buy my beef at costco and my burgers have a better flavor and less grease   at first i thought it was the bacon and cheese that was so greasy but i ate the meat separately and it was indeed the patty that was dripping with grease   with good beef  this burger could be as good as mighty fine but right now  theirs is a 4 1 2 and this one is more like a 3 1 2   another thing that i didn't like is the odd little licorice tasting (yuk) (fennel?) seeds sprinkled on the burger   another thing  the potato salad side was tiny (in a condiment mini cup) and very tasteless   i realize i am a foodie and a harsh critic but i don't think i will order the burger here again   with that said  i would love to see places like this succeed so i would possibly try another menu item   that's my story  lock  stock & barrel!
i am not sure how this place could be better  everything we have tried has been nothing less than excellent  don't sleep on the hamburger  why wait in line at hoppdoddy when you can come here 
really good   really really good   i had the dip  impressive   i'll be trying the cob next time  it looked awesome sitting in front of one the customers close by  they didn't leave a crumb  neither did i 
had the veggie melt  delicious  fresh veggies on a fresh ciabatta roll  served fast and hot  nice selection of unique drinks including teas and ales  the atmosphere is very modern and inviting and clean  we will definitely be returning 
ridiculously great foodsuper fun atmospherenice peoplewhat more do you need?
so nice to have a cool place like this between austin & dripping springs  the food is real good and fresh and so's the coffee  really nice menu and reasonable prices 
my new favorite lunch place! hard to find quality ingredients and chef prepared meals this side of town  so happy we stumbled upon this place  we ordered the lox and the rueben  the portions were generous  the bread from a local baker  the meats fresh  produce local  so delicious  they also have kid friendly meal options  the prices are great given the high quality  if you have dietary issues or just eat clean  in general  definitely check them out 
so excited that this place opened   this place is ahhh mazing   we are already planning our next trip and what we want to try   the blt  the cobb salad  all of it!  stopped in for lunch and was so happy i did  great food  great atmosphere and $2 wine for lunch on a friday  can't get any better than that! thanks lb&bthe reuben with spicy russian dressing was outstanding 
my husband and i stopped here for lunch the other day and were really pleased! i had the grilled chicken sandwich (with pesto    my fave) and he had the french dip  and both were delicious! the bill was a little pricey (sandwiches are $8 12 and drinks are over $2)  but the sandwiches are quite large and you're definitely getting all the food you paid for  also love that they support local farms  we'll definitely be back 
good spot for lunch  not a cheap lunch  but great quality amd generous portions  my group had reuben  roast beef and french dip  all very good  roast beef had wasabi horseradish which had some kick  but great flavor  shared potatoe salad which was excellent  lemon bar and brownie were also great  casual but nice decor  wil be back to try breakfast!
have eaten here 6 7 times  the texas club is amazing  just the right kick  don't skip on the locally made root beer 
prob one of the best sandwich shops around w hand down best lox in town  staff is very helpful and happy to help a customer out!
glad this place is here near dripping  really good sandwiches   a friend and i met there for coffee and a bagel  the total for two lox bagels and one small coffee and minimum tip choice on the ipad was $27 60   the lox was great  but sadly the price isn't sustainable for regular stops 
hard toasted bread for my roast beef which was very difficult to eat  maybe flavor up the roast beef a bit  sandwich was very plain   i usually give a place a second chance  but the cook was smug and left a bad taste in my mouth  nice guy walking around checking on people  possibly owner manager?  you can tell he is putting in the effort for this new business  i really wanted to like this place with the cool name  ps  toasted bread with right out of the refrigerator cold roast beef doesnt go well together 
the best blt i've ever had! friendly and helpful wait staff  super clean and welcoming  atmosphere  they haven't seen the last of us ;) i can't wait to try more!
had the new yorker    it was delicious  i'm glad my honey and i decided to split it because it's pretty massive   on the other hand even though i was stuffed    i was craving more because it was so tasty   i also bought a side of the pickled jalapeños and that really set it off!  when we were done i went to see if they had any of the pickled jalapeños in a jar to sell and take home  but sadly they don't offer that yet   hint hint    after all said and done we had a very fulfilling lunch and we will be back for more!
very good food! great options  the sides could have used a bit more flavor  they also had a good beer wine soft drink selection   i had the pesto chicken breast sandwich   the prices yikes  a high on prices 
slow down on 290 and stop in for the most delicious bagel and house smoked lox! 5 stars!!
strolled in here before going to the nail shop next door  great place! hope they survive this location because the food was fantastic  clean shop  great decor  friendly staff  will absolutely be back!
this was a really solid sandwich  it's like if your mom tried to make a gourmet lunch for you   which i mean in a really positive way  you could tell that they were new  maybe figuring things out but really cared about producing a quality product for the customer  i'll be back!
great quality  gourmet food  love the bagel and lox and all the sandwiches  yes  i've tried them all  haven't tried dinner yet  but looking forward to it! did brunch with my family on sunday and it was delicious!
delicious food  friendly service and a very pleasant space to hang out at  we had a couple of sandwiches (french dip and blt) and a bowl of soup (something italian with beans  vegetables and dairy free)  all very yummy  can't wait to come back and try their lox 
my biggest complaint  rude manager owner  we are all about supporting local businesses but you have to want our business  this guy obviously does not  also  no wifi  virtually no breakfast despite yelp listing it as breakfast (manager owner said  "well  that's yelp")  and terrible fountain soda  it has beer & wine for lunch but given his attitude  we won't be back  want to support locals who are happy to see us instead  rest of staff was great though  food was just so so  too 
we had the best lunch!  where to start?! the blt and bagel & lox were fresh and huge and tasty with the perfect capers and red onion marmalade  seriously a symphony of flavors on the sammies   extras too  like pickles to die for  cobb salad  amazing   clubhouse  stacked  wow beer  score  and what a deal! everything  so  great! yummy fresh iced teas (yep  two fine choices)  and the cane sugar soda machine options were really tempting  but we passed  i have a lemon square connoisseur in the family  reporting theirs was the best one ever ever ever 
probably the best blt i've ever had  everything i ordered tasted fresh and homemade  very friendly staff  and fun and relaxed atmosphere 
this place is so good  wonderful sandwiches  soups and salads  all with local and fresh ingredients  i had the blt (add a fried egg!) and cheesecake brownie  and my wife had the veggie cheesesteak  they really were outstanding  fantastic new addition to the area! can't wait for them to start doing breakfasts!
had the turkey club   super good! nice to get a local business with good food out in this area!
as a native north easterner  i was hard pressed to find top of the line smoked lox deep in the heart of texas  but the search is over now that i've found lox box & barrel  this gourmet deli not only has the best bagel & lox i've found yet in texas  but has an incredible lineup of amazing sandwiches  salads  and soups as well quick counter service to eat in or easy grab n' go ready made meals to take out with you on your way out of austin into the hill country amazing friendly staff make this an easy choice to return to many times in the future 
probably the best turkey reuben i've had in a long time  i'll definitely return just for that  everything else looked delicious  staff was friendly and efficient  nice addition to the eateries on 290 
i haven't found deli food like this anywhere in texas!  the turkey pastrami was so tasty   reminded me of the turkey joe's i used to order in chatham  nj   the roast beef with wasabi horseradish  also incredibly delicious   and the lox & bagel i ordered last weekend for breakfast was just perfect   thank you so much for being here  so close to home!  this will definitely be my go to lunch and breakfast spot 
went for brunch today and had the bruben   reuben on a new york bagel with a fried egg!  it was awesome!  the deli case had a great display of smoked salmon so i got some lox and salmon pate to take home for pre thanksgiving snacks   love this place!
we got a new yorker and roast beef sandwich  on the new yorker  the homemade corned beef was the best i have ever had  not too salty and went well with the marble rye  sauerkraut  cheese  and dressing  the homemade pickles are great  the quality of the roast beef and cheese was great  the baguette was not toasted like another reviewer experienced  i know some reviewers talk about the price  but the quality of the ingredients is what you are paying for  my family will definitely be going back again 
i've stopped here many times for their classic breakfast bagel and can say that it's fantastic    the smoked salmon is really good  but it's the fresh bagels that make it outstanding   today we stopped for lunch and i had the corned beef reuben and my wife had the green goddess cobb salad   they use fresh ingredients and it shows  everything was very flavorful and the marble rye on the reuben was outstanding   i've read several reviews complaining about the price  but you get what you pay for   if you want processed meat on plastic bread  there's a subway across the street   )   i highly recommend this restaurant 
omg  very mediocre corned beef at an outrageous price  i could go to manhattan and get twice the sandwich for less  note to the owners this is not manhattan and your quanity and product is not good enough to warrant your prices
what a disappointment! i've been excitedly waiting for this place to open  so my high expectations probably contributed to my disappointment  it wasn't that the food was bad  but $10 for a tuna salad sandwich with about a 1 2 inch of tuna salad? all i tasted was the bread  and for your $10  you don't even get a tortilla chip on the side   just a really weird tasting pickle  my husband got a meat sandwich that was similar   mostly bread 
i had lunch there yesterday  best blt sandwich i have ever had  and this was my second time to go there  and get it from them  so thought i would post a report   extremely good "b" which they smoke in house    this sandwich has some kind of onion marmalade spread which is just outstanding   good bread  well toasted  funny  how such a simple thing can be hard to pull off well  but they sure do it   no  its not cheap   but yes  it's worth every bit of what they charge for it   heavy rain at lunchtime yesterday seemed to drive everyone indoors  all tables were occupied when i walked in the door  but by the time i ordered  one opened up  and i noticed the staff was really hustling to get tables cleared and cleaned the minute folks left   there are very few places in austin that cure their own meat (much less smoke their own fish  like they do here)   it is a labor of love  and to do it well seems to require passion bordering somewhat on obsession   this establishment reminds me of what jesse griffith is doing at his dai due restaurant on manor road   i have been to feral hog hunting   butchering and cooking school with jesse  i e am a little bit more fixated on bacon processes than most folks (and for many years i had a pet pig i raised on a milk bottle  named patsy cline)   there are worse things to be obsessed with  than bacon  try the blt here and see what you think     william osborn (owner of place down the hill with the old passenger railroad cars being restored) 
nice friendly staff  ordered the corned beef reuben   great tasting sandwich  it had less meat than i had expected having seen some advertised photos  but tasted awesome 
this place is a must visit   the food is amazing and the people are great   try the breakfast reuben but everything on the menu is fantastic   just what drippin' needed 
i remember i came here when they first open and i was not a fan at all  i decided to come back last month and give it a try because 1) i wanted ramen and i didn't want to travel all the way to hashi or have ajisen 2) and why not give them another chance since they might have improved after a year or so after opening  i'm glad i did give them a second chance  i ended up liking their ramen a lot  i heard that this place aren't legit japanese ramen and i see why it is not  i also heard that this place is taiwanese version ramen tomato beef ramen 4 5 you can definitely taste the tomato broth  nice balance between tomato and beef  i like the mix  i like how they have 3 4 pieces of cherry tomato  the egg was perfectly runny and i can taste a little of soy sauce flavor   reminds me of tea eggs spicy beef with sour cabbage 4 5 love the herbal taste of the broth  i like how you can definitely taste herbal and with the spicy kick  it made the whole ramen like a dream  the sour cabbage is sour the way i like it  they don't include egg for this ramen   so if you want egg you can add it for 1$ only  spicy popcorn chicken 3 5 5 i had better somewhere else but it is worth the price for how much you get  probably not enough spice and the saltiness  the ladies who work here are all friendly and nice  15$ min for cc 
i'm not quite sure why this place is so well liked   i ordered the b1 "sheng spicy sauce with top blade slices"  which is a dry noodle that seems to be really popular on yelp the first thing that i noticed was the portion size   it seemed like quite a small portion to charge $9   it was a really simple bowl of ramen noodles with some scallions and bean spouts   the top blade slices was just that   a few slices of top blade sirloin  which was sliced thin but somehow continued to be somewhat tough   and i guess the star was supposed to be the spicy sauce  which was nothing more than a hot chili oil made with szechuan peppers so it's a tingling heat the ramen noodles were store bought egg noodles that you can buy at the market in the refrigerated section   there was nothing at all special about them   after mixing everything together  it tasted exactly as you'd expect hot chili oil tossed in ramen noodles would taste the tea they served complimentary with the meal was pretty good and i think i enjoyed that more than the noodles overall  it was definitely not a satisfying meal and it felt like i overpaid for something that i could easily put together at home perhaps i just ordered the wrong thing and i should go back to try their soup ramens  but i don't think i'll have the desire to give this place another try when there are so many other places in flushing to try out 
ok ramen prices are good you won't go bad for coming here but it doesn't scream i have to come back
i tried this place out a while ago with my sister for lunch and it was just not a good experience overall  anyways  this is one of those long overdue reviews since i've only recently gotten into writing reviews for places i eat at  to be fair though  i felt the ramen was just ok and if i was basing my review only on the taste of the food then i would be giving this place two or three stars instead  and like i said  it was a while ago so maybe they've even improved on the taste of their ramen since my visit  the reason i had to take stars away is because while we were eating my sister found a strand of steel mesh in her bowl of ramen  it looked like it must have came from one of those steel mesh scrubbers that's used to clean pans and other cookware but regardless  it definitely didn't belong in a bowl of ramen 
love their new menu item  the spicy beef ribs ramen    its delicious   and beyond its price  worth every cent usually just ordering beef ribs at a restaurant will run you $20 and up for sure     so paying $15 was a big surprise  it's tender and juicy in the middle and they now provide gloves so you don't make a mess devouring it by hand ;)i also noticed they added two imported japanese sodas that i didn't see before  so i bought them both to try it out  the soda brand is a well known plum wine brand called choya  the green can one tasted like peach and plums    it's an acquired taste    too asian for me lol   the other one is a unique mandarin orange flavor   that was a pleasant surprise in its accuracy  but folks   there's only 10% juice and they're both high in sugar  it is soda after all  but i like this one still  )
sheng ramen is my second time coming to eat here  first time i came here they didn't have much stuff on the menu but today when i stopped by the menus was updated inside is nice and clean my experience with the food was great & bad at the same time  today i ordered the fried buns  tonkatsu ramen  jajian mien  veggie dumpling and spring roll tonkatsu ramen i felt that the soup was a little salty for me  the pork was round and huge i didn't like it  jajian mien was not my type of noodles  it has some kind of weird taste which i decided to stay away from it the veggie dumpling was delicious! it was crispy outside  the dumpling skin was green  i'm not too sure but i think it was kale the spring roll inside was just mushy  outside was too greasy  it's self serve no need to tip them there's water  hot tea and sauces which you will have to grab it on your own the lady at the counter was nice and other lady who served my food was also nice and smiling so i put $2 tip for her i will come back next time to try out another stuff from their menu 
if you're looking for a quick noodle fix with not much expectations  then this place might do  this is not your local ippudo or ichiran if those are the flavors you're looking for  ordered the sheng ramen and tonkatsu  average flavors at best  the noodle texture was ok  but the broth and ingredients are lacking  i still prefer the local restaurants nearby serving beef noodle soup 
the tomato beef ramen is my favorite  i order it every time i am here  the portion is decent with their generous sized bowls  my kids love the tonkotsu ramen soup  we also ordered a variety of their small dishes   the cashier lady has 3 kids of her own so she is sympathetic to my large group and is always helpful and chatty  i think she might be taiwanese  but i cant be sure  i have to remember to get her name next time!the food here is good  and the food arrives pretty quickly  to the reviewer who said no tipping  even though tipping is not required because you do order the food and pay at the register  notice there are no garbage cans to dispose and clean up  the staff comes to tender the tables at the end of your meal so it remains clean  be courteous and tip  its a small price to keep the spot sooo well kept 
free green tea and iced water  no tipping because you place your order and then your food comes and you get your own water green tea  the tonkotsu ramen was pretty good with the marinated egg  i wished i tried the beef ribs ramen but next time! also got beef strips for an appetizer and that was tasty  the minced pork was a winner   i haven't had minced pork for a while and it was amazing! super tasty and i could eat that for multiple meals! the cute little old lazy who was serving was super friendly and cheerful  she definitely brightened up the room! she's awesome 
a taiwanese ramen shop located in flushing  this place is a seat yourself and order at the counter place  the staffs will bring your order to the table you're seated  i came with 2 friends for dinner  they ordered the tonkatsu ramen and the gyu kotsu ramen  i ordered the sheng ramen  staffs were friendly and service was quick  foodwise  the sheng ramen was flavorful and the portion was just right!
i'm very pleased with what this place brings to the table  both figuratively and literally   the menu offers a pleasant variety of taiwanese side dishes and an interesting arrangement of noodles   there is plenty to choose from so you certainly won't go through it all after one or even two visits much of the accommodations are self serve almost cafeteria style; the utensils  tea  and water are gathered by the counter for your own helping and you can seat yourself   there also isn't a waiter to take your order; the menus are available at the counter but a server may bring them by if she's cleaning up a table the beef noodle soup that apparently most people look to try didn't appeal as much to me   the large beef ribs are ok   they've cooked long enough to soak up a soup flavor but they're not super well done to the extent they fall right off the bone which i would rather   the soup and noodles are ok too; there isn't anything too special in my opinion since most of the flavor comes from the spicy oil they add to beef broth   overall i'd say it's ok and worth a try but i'd probably be more interested in spending on several smaller dishes the jajiang mien was a little better than the beef noodle soup in my opinion   if you've had a jajiang mien before you know that nearly every place pretty much puts a variation of the ground meat sauce and that's about it   nothing all that different here but it's still good nevertheless the minced pork on rice which i consider the staple of taiwanese food is probably the best go to if you don't know what to get   it's pork belly and maybe some ground meat cooked together on rice but the flavor is addictive the one minor thought i had was that this place is kind of tucked away on the first floor of a building i honestly didn't even know existed until i yelped the two nearby blocks   and there are even more restaurants in the same hallway that i would have never known were there   although it's not the first place you'd find walking down the sidewalk but it is absolutely worth a try recommendation  minced pork on rice
overall the food was very good and the customer service was on point   my only complaint would be  that the food is a bit pricey but still you should try 
this place can easily be missed if you're not looking for it  so my advice is to look for it  sheng ramen has brought something new to the food mecca that flushing has been and is  while continuously growing  you can't compare this to your typical japanese ramen joints because it's something pleasantly different  it's a no frills establishment hidden between some heavy hitter restaurants like congee village and dolar hotpot  but with flavors that can hang with the competition  the menu is simple and straight forward serving up some taiwanese ramen and small bar snack things like popcorn chicken  which btw is pretty darn good  now for most ramen places  even pho  it's all about that broth  for me at least  the broths here are amazing  i've come here numerous occasions and the broth is consistent every time  full of that boiled to death bone goodness  it's what keeps me going back  the noodles are nicely al dente  and most of the orders are served with some sliced meats similar to hot pot meats  overall  this place is good and a easy choice for me when i'm in the area  although my one negative feedback would be the price as it's a little high for what you get and portions are slightly small for me  but with the direction flushing has been headed  it's becoming harder and harder to compare to the good ol days of cheap eats in this neighborhood  for some  the price points may not be worth it  but the flavors and taste has made me a fan and i'd definitely be back  stay fat mother suckers
had the bone marrow ramen  just ok  soup is not bad  ramen is just soso  it's bit hidden because it is on the end of prince st and all the way inside the building  bit pricy on the ramen 
sheng ramen is the guilty perpetrator as to why homegirl can never keep a new years resolution  simply immoral! and let me tell you why  their lu rou fan (steamed rice w  meat sauce) is mind blowing  it's truly reminiscent of my own grandmother's lu rou fan recipe  i don't even mind that it doesn't come with the usual tea egg and yellow pickled radish  the meat sauce itself is enough to keep me going back for seconds and thirds  it just melts in your mouth jeez  i usually order more so i have lunch packed for the next day  while most people go for the soup ramen  i actually prefer the dry ramen  b1  remember the number  get it  you will thank me and then you will come back to this review and vote useful  cool  & funny  the sheng spicy sauce w  top blade slices is my go to every single time  i would stay clear of this if you're not a fan of spicy food  but i love it  after every single bite  i can't help myself but go in for another  it's a party in your mouth type of feeling  writing this review alone while thinking of my b1 is enough to get my mouth watering  so trust me on this one and don't even get me started on the popcorn chicken  it's crunchy  flavorful  and just addicting to eat  would definitely advise sharing this as an appetizer with your table   the concept itself makes me feel like i am back in taiwan  in most taiwanese restaurants  you usually seat yourself and order at the counter  every time i visit  the friendly staff greets me warmly  it's nice to feel home y at this restaurant  as a taiwanese myself  i'm a hard critic when it comes to authentic taiwanese food  so hats off to you  sheng ramen  you have vicki chen's stamp of approval  i guess i'll forgive you for always tempting me to break my diet new year's resolution! ;)
i ordered the tonkatsu ramen and it is very flavorful  i love that it is not salty at all because my daughter loves to eat ramen too  hubby ordered the spicy beef  tasted it too and it's also very flavorful   
i'm so glad this place opened up! it's filling in for the lack of ramen places in queens  the only other ramen place is in bayside which is a little far for me to go to!this place is located inside the plaza mall that's housing congee village and many other new food places! my friend and i walked in and seated ourselves  we then went up to the cash register to order  i love how relaxed this place is and it's not an actual restaurant experience with waiters and all   the staff were really friendly! i got the gyu kotsu ramen and my friend got the popcorn chicken and one of the dry ramens  everything was super yummy! i don't think this place is "authentic" ramen but it's still ramen  the prices are also reasonable i would deff come back to try their other dishes! $15 card minimum!
3 5 starsi did not try their ramen so it's a review on their small dishes their prices increased    from  50 to a $1 more which makes a big difference at least for me since i care about value  $5 5 for a tiny portion of takoyaki  these balls are much smaller than the ones i've had in the city or the ones at the nightmarket  l had one not so fresh piece of octopus but the others were fine  but 5 tiny balls for $5 50 is expensive for flushing and they were not the best i've had though much better than the ones at the food court!the taiwanese popcorn chicken was okay  my first time trying taiwanese food to be honest and i'm not a fan of this appetizer  it really needs a sauce and luckily i brought it home and used a delicious bbq sauce to dip them in  it has an odd seasoning that i'm not familiar with  also it's definitely not white meat  what was delicious and quite comforting was the rice with meat sauce that is currently $5  who doesn't love fatty meat in a light savory sauce  i would definitely get this again but i feel like it's kinda expensive for the portion especially when it was simply $4 before  i can make pork belly at home  if i wanted to    almost $18 total for a snack to share instead of having dinner  kinda overpriced but i will come back and try their noodles  honestly i was going to give this 3 stars but there's this adorable older lady that works there that is just so kind and helpful   just like my mom  definitely have her around customers cuz she gave you this extra star  if i had only ordered the rice dish it definitely would've deserved the 4 stars but the small portions is deterring customers since flushing is full of cheap eats with generous portions  we did get a free red tea which was delicious and had the perfect amount of sweetness 
another overdue yelp review!3 5 starsthe husband and i stumbled upon here for our lunch date after i did some yelp research for a place to eat in flushing since we were around the area this taiwanese ramen tastes different from the japanese ramen but in a good way!i enjoyed my bowl of mildly spicy ramen  the husband  on the other hand  thought it was good but he expected more  he thought the ramen was only soso  his spicy broth tasted flavorful though our appetizers were not bad  we ordered takoyaki and fried squid they accept credit cards with a $15 minimum there is a little sauce station that you make your own sauces  they could expand this station though the restaurant is fairly clean with free wifi i think but we did not get to use it we were seated and given menus  then the husband walked up to the front and order they offer free oolong tea!sheng ramen is kinda hidden because it's located inside a building above congee village kid friendly with high chair available! too bad we didn't bring our daughter that day  she loves to eat mein mein hehewe might go back one day if we ever want an inexpensive taiwanese ramen fix in flushing reminder  no tips required  but the husband still left tips since the server was super nice and friendly to us 
love the spicy beef ramen it was amazing and the spicy dumplings  i enjoyed every minute of it and my  party of 4 were really pleased   staff is welcoming and fun they were really nice and smiling   can't wait to come back  very flavorful   )
it wasn't bad but don't expect ramen  this is chinese noodle soup that imitates japanese ramen  it should be named sheng noodles instead  let's get with the breakdown  place   inside a newer building in flushing where it is cleaner  once you get to sheng ramen  nothing about the interior was charming to me  everything was there for you to sit and eat your noodles  service   can't complain  they work and will bring you anything you need  food   i ordered the house sheng ramen  it has a light kick of spiciness to it but it was bearable and decent  i wasn't impressed because you can get the same bowl of soup for cheaper elsewhere  the meat it comes with is very light  wish they put more  everything else seemed to be just dumped in  taiwanese popcorn chicken   normal  always a good dish to share  overall  an average place to me  i might go back if friends drag me  not a bad place though!
place is inside the small mall on top of congee village ordered the sheng ramen and cucumber salad in the front register  they give you a number and you choose any seat and wait for them to bring it to you sheng ramen had a good amount of spicy  but not overly spicy to prevent you from enjoying the noodles and the meal   the beef was thin sliced and was very fresh  clean  and lean   the pig blood tasted weird  but its not for everyone   the tofu in the soup reminded me of hotpot  but matched well with the noodles   the broth was tasty and great  i kept sipping it spoon after spoon  then i had to stop cause i feared it might be too much msg which will make me thirsty later (i was not thirsty hours after and i'm assuming no msg? so this was good broth!)   noodles was al dente  make sure to stir it up and let it soak a bit more if you like it to be softer cucumber salad was a great side dish to compliment the spicy ramen   the cucumber was loaded with garlic and tasted great will be back to try the dry noodles and other side items credit card minimum is $15 
sheng ramen is a noodle joint that i got to visit lately  although at first i thought it was japanese food it was actually chinese taiwanese style noodles  but either way i love noodz so i had to try it out i got to try the jajian mien  the fried buns and the wintermelon drink which was a special combo during their grand opening week  the jajiang mien although good i wish i added some hot oil to it cuz the noodles became a little stiff if you don't mix them right away since it is a soupless ramen  soup noodles are definitely better for a noodle pull  the noodles were springy and the portion was just right to me not too little not too much i also got to try the gyukotsu beef noodle soup with perfectly made eggs that had a gorgeous runny yolk served in this luscious 72 hour bone broth full of umami flavor and had a calming effect on me after the first sip  the beef it is served with though is very thinly sliced and similar to what you would get when you dine hot pot style  i wish the beef were marinated or seasoned a bit more but the broth almost makes up for it the fried buns are such a fun thing to eat as well  these little fried puffs of dough can be dipped into condensed milk thats served on the side for a bit of sweetness  is it an appetizer? is it a dessert? not sure but i want more of these i also finished it off with a house made wintermelon herbal tea which was a refreshing end to my meal  the interior looks like it would be self serve but has waiters bussing the tables and everyone is so warm like they really appreciate your business and want to serve you efficiently  most of the seating is basically just stools so don't expect a fancy dinner here it can be a little hard to find since there is no street entrance but you actually have to go into the building thats connected to congee village and its right next to the dessert shop on the 1st floor i would definitely return for that bone broth and whenever i have a craving for their fried buns and herbal tea 
it's lunchtime! hubby and i decided to try this new  cafeteria style taiwanese food place out  located in the heart of flushing that just opened up recently  we came here around 1 pm on a sunday afternoon so it was crowded as usual  you can almost always find parking in the municipal parking lot if you don't feel like looking for street meter parking  which is what we did and it was only 2 blocks away from here  you can sit wherever you please as a sign on the door indicates  service was great with a server telling us how ordering works and pushing 2 tables together so we had more room for our food  there's a self serve station with utensils  condiments (vinegar  spicy miso butter and chili paste)  iced water and hot tea so help yourself  there was also a grand opening special going on for the month of may (ended 5 21)  where you can choose from 3 combo options and it includes a choice of fried buns or cucumber salad and an iced winter melon or herbal tea  i got the sheng spicy sauce dry ramen combo with fried buns and winter melon tea and the braised beef broth with dumplings  the fried buns had a sweet dipping sauce of condensed milk  which was sweet and tasty  the winter melon tea tasted great with just enough sweetness to keep us from becoming too thirsty  the dry ramen with beef had a spicy kick of flavor  which had my taste buds wanting more but it was super spicy though  the dumplings were good and had more filling than dough  which filled my husband's stomach up rather quickly  all in all  the food tasted great with the most authentic taiwanese flavor we have yet encountered  the meal was also very cheap and service was great so please remember to tip even though everyone is saying no tip required because its self serve  stop being cheap! as we left  our server waived bye to us  which made us feel important as customers  we will be back again especially since i didn't get to try the jajang and shacha dry ramen this time 
bomb a$$ ramen ! hole in the wall but definitely worth finding great atmosphere lady at the counter was really nice nice portion size as well !spicy beef rib ramen is a must try
sheng ramen isn't your traditional japanese ramen  they use the same ramen type noods and gave it a chinese twist  the ramen i got was the special with a little of everything  i liked the blood cake and tofu  the broth had a nice  deep flavor that was very satisfying on a cold day  my favorite thing might actually be the fried taiwanese chicken nuggz  they were perfectly fried and seasoned without feeling too heavy  i didn't want to share  i also really liked the complimentary self service tea and water they provide  i've seen deals on groupon for cash back  will definitely use that next time i go 
ramen was bland  squid was re fried  popcorn chicken had too much batter  the runny boiled egg was the most perfect part of my dish  sad to say  service was pleasant that's why 3 stars  self service on the free barley tea and water was fine  so not complaining about that 
no it's not the ramen you think  it's not japanese ramen but more like chinese taiwanese noodles  but pretty good noodles! not sure if i'd come back  it's inside the building which houses a bunch of other food options (congee village  dolar shop  etc)  very casual place  you just order at the cashier and sit down 
i think i came with pretty high expectations after hearing a friend's recommendation but was let down when i came  i ordered the a1   spicy ramen with beef slices  beef tendon  frozen tofu  duck pudding  bean sprouts  and scallions  it was my first time trying duck pudding  i expected it to taste similar to pig's blood but found it to be more of a moist texture  the szechuan spice was a little too much for me though so i swapped dishes with my boyfriend  he thought my dish was a good level of spice but that the flavor was lacking  i had his b7  jajang with minced meat  which was a noodle dish topped with a thick sauce with minced meat and zucchini  it was decent  the noodles were a good texture  but the portion could have been bigger to share  we got the spicy dumplings which were just regular dumplings sitting in oil  the cucumber salad tasted a little off too  overall wasn't that impressed with our meal  won't be back 
tried 3 different noodles  spicy dumplings  and the egg drop soup on 3 separate visits  all were well prepared  and consistently tasty the restaurant has added more items to an expanded menu  it is a nice goto spot when you want something else that's not food court style can't wait for another visit 
i love the cafeteria style of service here  my favorite thing to order is the sausages  taiwanese fried chicken and any of their noodle soup dishes  they are all pretty tasty   they also have a nice selection of sakes and beers  great atmosphere to come with friends for a full on dinner or some snacks and drinks 
this place is a little hidden within this building  when you walk up the stairs  the entrance will be to the left door  walk straight in then turn right  it's a little confiding at first but once you see 520 dessert  you'll see sheng right next to it  i came here specifically to try their ramen based on the hype on yelp  assuming it would give that wow factor  i actually didn't get what other yelpers were raving about  the ramen was average and super oily my party ordered a1   spicy beef ramen w  tendon  beef slices  frozen tofu  veg (2x) one without duck blood pudding and b1 (same as a1 except the dry version)  and popcorn chicken  a1  lacking flavors and very very oily  reminds me of a chinese restaurant that serves beef stew except it would taste better than here b1  soggy ramen  hard to mix noodles in a tiny bowl popcorn chicken  lacking flavor and small portion  fried sage leaves wasn't fried enough  the chicken was juicy but it wasn't fried enough  need more seasoning! overall  if you're expecting japanese ramen  you're looking at the wrong place  this is pretty authentic taiwanese ramen but just missing flavor in every dish  will probably not return again 
it's nice to see something different opening in flushing  it seems that a common misconception a lot of people are having about this place is that this restaurant doesn't serve the type of ramen most people are accustomed to  they serve taiwanese styled ramen and although it's not too different from japanese ramen  you can definitely see the difference in the options of broth and topping they offer  service in flushing is usually horrendous  so i was surprised when the service here was pretty good  the staff was super friendly and patient; they helped us decide what to order when we didn't and politely pointed out where the self serve lemon infused water  simple things like this are super rare in flushing! i ordered the sesame & soft boil egg (b2) cause it was a pretty hot day and i didn't want anything too soupy  it tasted like peanut butter noodles which i enjoyed! the soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly and had a delicious runny yolk!  although i did enjoy my selection  my friends ordered the other dry ramens which were honestly much better than mine  i think i would recommend those over the sesame & soft boil egg cause it did come out a little more dry than the others  the taiwanese popcorn chicken is pretty good  crunchy on the outside and very juicy inside  overall would recommend this place! it's a bit hard to find though  you have to into the building that's next to congee village and walk past the dessert store 
this place is a hidden treasure located on prince street the restaurant is family run and serves up taiwanese style ramen  not to be mixed up with japanese style ramen the place is kept clean and tidy with a good amount of seating and has self serve ice water and tea in the front!the food here was beyond my expectations for there was a lot of flavor and left me wanting more  however  if you're going to get something spicy  keep in mind that it's not mild and wouldn't recommend if you can't handle spicy foods the service was good for the staff greets you when you first come and when you leave  which is typical asian culture  will definitely come again!
this is an unknown gem of flushing! it's a chain restaurant from taiwan that tries to up beef noodle soup to the next level  we tried the new item menu's tomato beef ramen and spicy beef rib ramen  and also a small bowl of braised pork rice  the beef they use is the sliced beef  but it's quite fitting  the tomato broth is wow  thick! some people say it's too salty  but i guess i like heavy flavor so i thought it was fine  the beef rib was fall off the bone  the portion was filling  a lot of places give too little meat  too much noodle  this place gives enough meat  enough noodle  and not enough veggies  we also tried their old fashion black tea and winter melon tea (made in house  not diluted by water  you can tell)  both were delicious and authentic  the auntie working there was chatting with us about how the store opened  and it was interesting she mentioned it's been opened for a year but a lot of people walk by and don't come in because they think it's a northern chinese noodle place or a fake japanese place  they don't have a sign that indicate they're taiwanese  but to me  the location isn't the most ideal so that could be a huge impact on their business  it's really too bad!!! i found it cute that they had a huge hand sanitizer on the table for you to use along with self serve lemon water and (great) self serve hot roasted tea 
this place a true hidden gem in flushing  first of all  all of the noodle bowls are delicious and my fav is non spicy beef ramen  it is very comforting  soothing yet creamy  it comes with tender beef slices that just taste so good on its own without even dipping in sriracha! if you are into spicy noodles  go for dry spicy beef ramen  it has spicy and refreshing flavor especially becaz of slightly fruity sauce ( i think there is plum in the sauce  not sure though)  also  self service n yet  really clean spot  on a side note  the noodle dishes are not really japanese  they r more like chinese n japanese fusion  overall  sheng ramen is a solid & nice place to satisfy noodle cravings in flushing if u get tired of chinese hand pulled noodles 
up there as one of the better ramen i've tried  the location is well set  service was great  and the temperature was nice and cold  offsetting the spicy ramen  the spicy dumplings was a surprising good  put my down as a fan 
this place is so good!!! and very quick!taiwanese fried chicken  perfectly crispy  and so juicy inside  can't believe it's only like $6  jajang dried noodles  exactly what i wanted  very yummy!spicy beef ribs  can't believe how much beef you get for $15  it was very good  different than your typical ippudo ramens  added bonus  free hot tea!
i actually enjoyed my ramen at this spot  i opted for the spicy dry ramen (i think it was b1) because i wanted to try something new and since it was extremely hot out  i didn't want anything soupy  im glad i made that choice  spicy level was perfect and it kind of tasted like packaged ramen but something made it good  prices are decent (around 8 10$) and there's a good amount of seating  i would probably return and try the soup ramen next time 
awesome service  sweet staff  this is one of the best spots in flushing if not in new york  their noodles and ramen are a1  try it and you won't regret it trust me 
i havent tried any other ramen but the spicy rib ramen was amazing! for $15 you get a huge piece of rib  half a tea egg  and very chewy ramen noodles  the broth is delicious by itself  in addition the popcorn chicken is very krispy on the outside and tender on the inside  the goyza however wasnt as good as i hoped  very plain  it is a self serve place and tip is not required  definitely would come again!!!
maybe i came in with high expectations  the food was okay  the soup and beef was a bit bland while the octopus tentacles were a bit too salty  the egg was perfectly cooked 
good customer service  friendly staff good selection of beers and japanese alcohol free cucumber water and tea  no tips is the best part but portion size is small for cost 
can't believe they serve the duck blood pudding  i thought it was illegal  but it's delicious cause i can only get that in taiwan  noodle soup base is delicious and the beef is not your regular beef  it's thinly sliced hotpot beef 
good ramen and laid back atmosphere  staff were friendly and easy going   great place for a quick bite 
this was my first time here and i didn't even know it existed until a friend told me she saw it on yelp and wanted to try it  definitely won't be my last time either  food was great and pretty cheap! though there are seats  you order at the counter and they bring the food out to you  but you still have to get utensils and napkins  tea or water yourself  all in all  a pleasantly quaint place to sit down and have a meal while also casual enough to feel like home 
ordered the sheng ramen  spicy beef ramen and popcorn chicken  love the popcorn chicken because it's crunchy on the outside while still moist on the inside  they have self service hot tea and iced water  and they use real cups  which is very nice  both ramen are ok  decent food but i don't think i'll be craving for this 
love this place for so so many aspects! i've come here twice and have yet to be disappointed  the place is casual  friendly  and clean  the staff are warm and attentive even though it's not a formal restaurant with table service  the food is authentic and delicious  i had the spicy beef sour cabbage rice soup and taiwanese popcorn chicken  the rice soup was unique and is a must try  the popcorn chicken was as good as this dish can get  don't forget the dessert! last time i came  i had the fried bun (man tou) with condensed milk which is always delicious to have as a dessert or snack  will definitely come back (probably by the end of this week ) 
i've been here for a few time  ordered take out a few time  nothing impressive to me until today  i order take out again  i order (f1) spicy beef broth w  dumpling with extra *beef slices *soft boiled egg *spicy frozen tofu and *spicy duck pudding  and (c8) gyoza so  the spicy duck pudding is amazing  if you are from taiwan then you will know what i'm talking about  here in u s the duck pudding or pork pudding is very different than the one we had in taiwan  but this place have these amazing spicy duck pudding  i told most of my friend to try it already also  gyoza is $5 for 8 pretty cheep and it tastes sooo good  one more thing  i've try their (c12) steamed rice w  meat sauce $4  the portion is a bit small  but it's really good too  very similar to the one i had in taiwan friendly staff  and it's self serve place 
note  4 5 stars  the owner servers were really nice and efficient so i bumped up the rating to 5 on yelp this is taiwanese style ramen  don't expect japanese ramen here the shop is self serve  you go in  take a seat  and order your food  they will bring the food to your table and clean the table afterwards  no tips required  you have to get your own utensils and water tea  i honestly prefer this method of establishment  everything is at my own pace and needs  they will also gladly help as needed i came here during my lunch hour on a wednesday with my coworkers  everyone got their food within 5 minutes of ordering (this included 5 bowls of ramen and a serving of fried chicken) the food is pretty good  i ordered a4 ramen noodles  the soup seems homemade (?) and it doesn't taste too salty or bland  i'm guessing there isn't much msg in the soup either since i didn't feel the need to drink water afterwards  the salt&pepper chicken was really juicy and hot (be carefu l selecting your spice level)  the soft boil egg is done just right  runny and delicious  the only suggestions i have is to add some more soup and bean sprouts to the dish  the portion size is just right for me; though i'm sure some people will need to add extra noodles or toppings to feel full overall  i would definitely come back in the near future 
we made an impromptu decision to eat dinner in flushing due to the amazing weather and our fortuitous parking spot  stumbled into the plaza to check out sheng ramen and the smell and casual setting was enough to make us want to stay   you order at the counter and they bring the food to you   the people who work there are very nice  kind of like eating with a friendly aunt there's so much on the menu that we want to try  but in an attempt for moderation  we each got a ramen   he got the gyu kotsu ramen (the clear soup  braised 72 hours) and i got the szechuan sour bean with minced meat dry ramen   both were really good  although there wasn't really any sour bean in the dry ramen  more like a spicy meat sauce  they have a beverage and condiment station where they offer water and hot tea and black and white vinegar  spicy miso butter  and chili paste  i threw some of the black vinegar in my noodles and it was pretty great we also ordered the fried bun with condensed milk which was amazing  crunchy on the outside and naturally sweet  made sweeter by dunking it in the condensed milk  so good  and best to eat it piping hot  in addition  we ordered the taiwanese popcorn chicken  which was good and juicy  but the pieces were a little bigger than the traditional version and they cover it with spicy chili powder  which isn't the norm overall i definitely recommend this place for a casual meal 
located deep within the building that houses 520 desserts  the inside of the restaurant is quite spacious and not too crowded  when we went in at the time  there was only one other group with us   the service was great  the waitress came by to our table after we ordered to check up on us and we had pleasant small talk the food itself was okay but not to my liking  the popcorn chicken was salty and overseasoned but my friends told me that's how it usually is  in terms of the ramen  i ordered the sheng ramen  the noodles were good in that they were firm yet easy to eat but the broth itself was underwhelming  it was spicy but there was no flavor to it  they recommended the winter melon tea  which i liked  so i suggest getting that  at the time  the restaurant was quiet and they have two tvs on opposing ends of the room to watch  creating some background noise  it's a good place to sit and talk 
ok food but wow service was horrible  the woman asked me to circled around twice in the building when i asked for bathroom and told her i need to go before ordering  guess what i found out  the bathroom was right next to her! i found out that after 20 min circling and didn't find the bathroom  she simply said " will you let me talk? " and blah with an attitude accusing me like every other customer as a liar!
this is a great little ramen spot  the people are super friendly and the ramen speaks for itself   had the beef ramen with the ribs and it was great  this quaint little restaurant is a must if you need to scratch a ramen itch!!!
cute little restaurant with delicious dishes  the restaurant name is ramen but it's really a taiwanese restaurant because the translation of ramen in taiwanese means pulled noodles  i enjoyed my minced been dry noodles and the braised egg drop soup   while my companion enjoyed his kyu kohsi dish  will we be returning? yes!
having the word ramen in their name was very misleading as i was excited to try out this new ramen shop but ultimately it was just a spicy noodle shop   there was nothing special about the broth or noodles besides it being spicy  the noodles tasted just like the noodles from a instant noodle package   someone into spicy noodle soup might enjoy this place though as mentioned by other yelpers the only item i did enjoy were the dumplings as that i would recommend 
ramen and taiwanese style?  my friend told me it was a chain overseas sheng noodle   had to check this out myself!  my friend and i got the a1 a2 b3 and some dumplings   a1 is the sheng noodles with duck blood  tofu and sliced beef   i got the spicy beef  which didn't have the duck blood and tofu but it had the slice beef and mustard greens with it   something similar to beef noodle soup   so they use japanese style noodles  which they give a hefty amount if you see the pictures   the broth and seasoning is really sensational   walking near this place you could smell all the flavors   we actually had trouble not salivating all over ourselves while we took pictures   my other friend tried the dry ramen b3  which was really good as well  it was a bit harder to mix it since it was a dry style she took some of the broth from the dumplings and added in her bowl to help get it going   we went for ramen and broth she wanted something a bit different  the dumplings were nice thick but soft skin and flavorful and juicy on the inside   we opted out on another spicy dish i heard of this spicy butter that is homemade  must check that out next time as always check the pictures out =)             another stop at sheng ramen they started to pick up some speed with customers coming in   now serving some neat combos  i got chrysanthemum tea    pickled cucumber salad or fried buns with condense milk and a ramen   i also ordered a sweet fermented tofu to try it out !     april 2018 tried their beef ribs ! that was really good reminds me of beef noodle soup with their added spicy paste   we also got popcorn chicken and cucumbers to add to our meal 
the service is worst than none  the food is not impressive  but the service is really bad  asking customer to use outside bathroom when there is one inside  when asked why she told people to go outside  she gave an attitude and said not sure you are a real customer  often  it is not what you said  but how you said it is the main problem 
came here for the gyu kotsu ramen and was pleasantly surprised when i found out that it was not your usual japanese broth which i always found too salty  sheng's taiwanese style ramen broth was tasty without being overly salty  really loved the marinated soft boiled egg  also gor to try the braised pork belly over rice as well and it's such a simple dish but it was super tasty and flavorful also tried several other sides like the soy garlic wings which were ready good  shredded potatoes which i thought was a bit spicy but that's just me  the fried buns with condensed milk was dessert and fun  will def come back to try other dishes that i haven't yet 
this was a very pleasant surprise  the pork ramen was delightful and the pork stomach was so delicious  the pork had a perfect ratio of fat to lean meat  so i practically melted in my mouth  i would say that this place is better than ichiran  the takoyaki was very good as well; it bursts in your mouth and coats your tongue  you're left with a piece of squid in the center 
the place was not crowded when i came on a wednesday night  probably because this place is hidden inside a giant building with a long hallway to get to   i ordered the spicy mala beef soup ramen and winter melon drink   the soup was very flavorful with the perfect balance of the peppercorn and hot chili flavor  not too much to overpower the taste of the beef flavor   the slices of beef were very tender and taste fresh  unlike the frozen fatty sliced beef usually served by other malatang restaurants   i love the frozen tofu which soaked up all the yummy soup and released them in my mouth with every bite   the place itself is cozy and clean  with wooden tables and chairs and large flat screen tv's on either side playing taiwanese and american shows   it's a nice place to come either with friends or just by yourself without having to feel awkward 
if you are looking for an authentic dining experience in taiwan  definitely visit sheng ramen  i grew up in taiwan and everything about this place reminds me of home  from the decor  to the service and food  i have no doubt about it that this place is 100% taiwanese  i love how clean this place is  they use japanese ramen noodles as the main carb which is a bit unusual for a taiwanese restaurant  however  it really goes well with different kinds of beef soup they offer  i love all the noodle soups  with a perfectly cooked soft boiled egg on the side   spicy beef dry noodle is a great choice if you are craving for something spicy without hot soup  minced meat over rice and popcorn chicken are also something that worth trying  i've been back 4 times so far since i discovered this place  i'll be back soon!
it's a taiwanese noddles restaurant so some may be confused from its name  i ordered a spicy beef noodles and the soup is quite yummy and similar to what i had in taiwan  the noddles can be a bit confusing as it tastes like the japanese ramen instead of the taiwanese noodles  the duck pudding is cut into slices which is a bit too mini  when you order pudding you would hope the size to be like a tofu at least  may come try another taiwanese food next time but not the duck pudding 
i came here with high hopes and left hungry  the noodles had a good consistency but the soup taste was alittle off  the pot stickers had a great crispy exterior with a stuffed interior but lacked flavor of any kind  i would try these out again if they taste tested the filling beforehand  the spicy dumplings are literally just regular dumplings drowning in hot oil sauce  too much oil  overbearing  skip 
tried this spot for the first time because i was craving ramen and i will definitely be back  you need to be ready for the different flavors  the cucumber salad was refreshing but the thick chunks of garlic were unpleasant  also i wasnt aware that the spicy sliced potatoe was  raw  it was marinated in spices and rice vinegar  the soups were delisious and not too heavy 
went in twice in a week! first time was because wanting to try out a new place  which it turned out to be a really nice surprise   i had the vegetable ramen and no joke the soup was delicious! decent portion too! my friend ordered sheng ramen and fried squid (new item~ ) she couldn't stop saying how good it was and how they were perfectly marinated seasoned!  her ramen was great as well! a bite of thin sliced beef then a bite of ramen~ awesome!2nd time was just because i had to bring my family and share the goodness   also to come back for my vegetable ramen!
this is not ramen  it's chinese noodles in soup  broth is overly waterly and the cha shu is thin slices of frozen pork belly that's been broiled for 5 minutes in a toaster oven very salty and loaded with msg 
the ramen was excellent! easy to get to and parking was easy compared to the rest of flushing  the guy we met that worked there was super friendly and it really made for an amazing experience keep in mind that the storefront is not right on the street    you need to walk into the building and through the shared hallway to find it you got to go there!! it is totally worth it!!!
over price！ this is not ramen  it just noodle  the duck pudding is not duck pudding   it pig blood pudding the portions are too small even for a slim girl!!see picture!
i honestly didn't think this place was good when i passed by the first time  it's hidden in a location that doesn't  get a lot of traffic  however i went today and honestly their broth was very good  it has distinct flavors from taiwan  i'm likely to come back again! i'd say their beef broth was better than most of the noodle places in new world mall  i haven't quite enjoyed a bowl of beef noodles in such a long time since flushing mall closed down   i wished they had more noodle options besides ramen!
not that good as a taiwanese noodle  it's below the average performance of taiwanese beef noodle in nyc  not mention compared with authentic ones from taiwan  disappointed 
love this place  it's clean  staff are friendly and the menu is awesome! their pork over rice is delicious  i have never had the traditional taiwanese meal that tasty  i believe the secret ingredient is their sauce    but ramen is good too  love their winter melon tea as well!
very good little ramen shop in busy area with lots of restaurants  hidden inside a building with several other restaurants  this place had a tasty treat that was served quickly that i was ready to slurp!
love the spicy dumplings  the staff is super friendly  one of my favorite places in the neighborhood  i must get myself to try more than the spicy dumplings 
atlantic taiwanese food mix with little japanese style super delicious  aaa services!!! perfect spot for lunch and quick dinner  highly recommend it
when it comes down to flushing  there is a plethora of food places ranging from stands  food courts  windows  and restaurants  in addition  the list of cultural list of cuisines here are massive  when it comes down to it  choosing a place to eat can be overwhelming  in the case of sheng ramen  they help make picking a place to eat easier  despite being named sheng ramen  this place has a wide range of food options including rice  soup  dumplings  and salads  they also serve teas like wintermelon  herbal  jasmine  and red tea  appetizers range anywhere from $3 6 and include traditional taiwanese dishes like taiwanese popcorn chicken  marinated beef shank   pork ear  and pickled vegetables  for entrees or larger dishes  prices range anywhere from $5 to $10  these entrees include steamed dumplings in broth (amazing)  dry and wet ramen (amazing)  and rice in soup (also pretty amazing)  considering the effort  quality  and portions of the food here  this place is a pretty good steal  i would recommend getting the braised pork with rice and any type of ramen dish  the noodles here are al dente~ usually with your selection of meat  bean sprouts  and a perfectly cooked runny soft boiled egg you wont regret coming here p s 1  they have free self service lemon water2  they have free self service hot tea
i'm a fan  they delivered my food in 15 20 minutes after i ordered it (granted  we're located down the block) the food was amazing  i'm definitely ordering from this place again 
went with my coworkers here and tried the ramens it was good and the chicken was heaven! the workers was nice to us
not exactly your classic taiwanese beef noodle soup but adjust your expectations and a very good meal could be had  the soup base for the classic a1 option lean towards a mala flavor and the beef used is sliced brisket  the wife had a dry bowl that tasted like a pretty solid zajiangmian  we also ordered a taiwanese popcorn chicken and a fried mantou with condensed milk dip which were both good but came out with odd timing (the dessert mantou was served first before anything else and the popcorn chicken was served last)  not a perfect meal but met expectations and would repeat!
this is a discreet place you can take family or colleagues to for brunch  they have music video on one side & cable tv on the other with music in background that doesn't sync
came here because of the four star yelp reviews and was a little disappointed  they serve ramen type noodles in not so flavorful broth  although i am aware that this is not japanese ramen i still expected my broth to be special or flavorful  overall there weren't anything special about the ramen and i wouldnt come back  i also ordered dumpling in hotoil sauce and that was just okay  nothing to rave about  it is sort of a selfserve place where there is an area for you to get your own water but when we were ordering and paying at the same time our receipt was showing if you want to tip x amount of dollars  we ended up tipping not knowing that it was self serve  i guess it kind of feels like tipping the person that takes your order at mcd  this place is located above the new congee village and right next to 520 dessert  not hard to find at all!
was feeling for some shanghai tonight  was browsing through yelp for some locations around me and this spot came up  it's a shanghai type cuisine but they serve their noodles with ramen noodles  with either "dry ramen" or "soup ramen"   styles  we went for the dry noodles  i tried the jajang w minced meat (i don't usually eat meat and ive asked for them to not add bean sprouts or scallions  i'm pregnant now and shouldn't be eating that)  and the husband tried the sheng spicy sauce w top blade slices  i tried his noodles and boy it was spicy! if you're into spice that hits you right on the spot this is the dish for you to be honest i'm not really feeling their jajang sauce  its a really a bit too dry for me  im use to having the kind that's a bit more saucy  it's still good though  their noodle was al dante   loves the chewy ness to it  we also ordered the taiwanese popcorn chicken  it sat on the table for 3 mins and it was still hot when you bite into it!  the breading wasn't thick or left a greasy oil taste in your mouth so it was good  overall experience for this place  good 
amazing place on par with any ramen place in the city  the taiwanese chicken and spicy beef ramen is done like no where else  super nice people running the place too
some of the best veggie ramen i have ever had   the tomato base is so well seasoned  you don't even realize its tomato!
did not enjoy anything that was ordered on our first time here  the only think that was good was the pig ear and even that was too cold and too hard the taiwanese sausage was the size of my pink finger (no wonder it was cheap)and even though everything looked very promising   the main dishes were totally bland will not be returning 
got spicy dumplings in soup broth  delicious! in a bldg with lots of great looking chinese and japanese food options  but i'm glad i chose this one!
reminds me of asia! walk in  order at the front and pick your own seat  i got the a4? the non spicy galbi beef ramen  came with a perfect egg (soft boiled with almost runny yolk)  it was a delicious of beef and noodles  also got the taiwanese fried chicken  that was too spicy and salty for me  but the chicken itself was so tender and juicy inside that i kept wiping off the hot spice and salt so i could continue eating  i am definitely going back for the noodles 
taiwanese style ramen located inside this building full of other dessert and food places  you have to walk down a few hallways but they have taped signs up so it wasn't that hard to find  you order at the counter and seat yourself as you walk in  they give you a number and they will bring the food over to you once it's ready  since the place just opened not long ago they're doing a promotion until 5 31 17 where you can order a ramen with either fried buns or pickled cucumber salad plus a drink for only $12 $14; which is a super good deal  the ramen portion was pretty generous but i didn't personally find it to be super amazing but the either way i thought the food was worth it  i liked how the spoons were the types with an edge on them where you can hook it to the side of your bowl so the spoon doesn't fall in and drown in your soup as it pretty much always happens to me  both the herbal tea and winter melon tea was good and they have a self service drink area where you can get iced water and hot tea  since you order and pay before you eat you don't have to tip but we left some on the table anyway!
def not authentic in any way  not in taiwanese  not in 'ramen'  it is a hybrid noodle shop  the two ramen bowls we got had noodles that was from the fridge  not fresh  the meat was korean bbq   hot pot style thinly sliced meat  not braised  the vegetable consist of broccoli  bean sprout and old carrot  also  why the two large tv on each side of the wall? it tacks on a terrible atmosphere to a counter service noodle shop 
every since i got back to new york for summer break i've been dying to try this place out  i finally decided to come try this ramen place out with a friend of mine a week ago  at first i was really skeptical since a lot of places in flushing claim they have ramen but it's just regular noodles  the store was in a building along with a bunch of other restaurants but it wasn't really hard to find  when we stepped in there weren't many people since we came right after lunch time  it was quiet and the place was very clean  we seated ourselves and the waitress brought over the menus  she was really nice  we then went up to the cash register to order  i got the gyu kotsu ramen and my friend got the braised beef and vegetables ramen and we shared an order of gyoza we were pleasantly surprised because the ramen was really good! it wasn't too salty and the portions were big  the beef was cooked perfectly! the guisa was really good as well  they didn't let it burn or undercook it  it was just right  my friend really enjoyed his meal as well and it was his first time trying ramen that didn't come in a plastic bag haha  overall  my experience was terrific and i will definitely be coming back since i'm in flushing very often!
came here for lunch and noticed it was a new spot so went to try it out with a group of friends  it's a bit hidden inside queens crossing but not difficult to find  the restaurant is more of a fast food self serve style  go up to the front and order your dish and they'll bring it to your table  there's also plenty of tea  water and other condiments available for self serving as well  i ordered the braised beef ramen and winter melon tea drink  loved the winter melon drink  it's a sweet flavor but not overly sweet  definitely refreshing  the ramen was a bit average or underwhelming  the thing is that this isn't japanese ramen  which typically gives you a punch of flavor  yet even though this is taiwanese style i still am expecting that in your face burst of umami flavor  i just felt i was eating a chinese style beef noodle soup that used ramen  it wasn't bad  but there wasn't anything special i could say for it  there wasn't anything that would make me want to go back a second time  noodles aren't too pricey  around $10 11 but i prefer the $7 noodle soups from ny food court 
if you're like me and searched yelp for "ramen" and found sheng ramen  you're gonna have a bad time the name really should be sheng noodles  instead of sheng ramen  i'm alluding to the name being misleading they basically took a taiwanese beef bowl  transplanted the regular noodles with ramen  and called it a day  the owner must have patted himself in the back 3 times that day the taste  it's okay  like a regular bowl of taiwanese noodle soup  except with ramen the business probably knew they can put the word "ramen" in their name  and then magically able to add +$4 to their noodle items  kudos to them having business sense  capitalizing on the hipster crowd thinking they are trying a brand new kind of "ramen"  one last thing  their beef broth is jeb bush  weak and low energy 
came here because the food pictures looked great  got the sheng spicy dry noodles  spicy beef and sour cabbage ramen and spicy steamed dumplings with red tea  the dry noodles were not tasty and just spicy and numbing while the ramen was just average  the spicy steamed dumplings were good but nothing to die for  while the red tea was spot on  seating is spacious and comfortable and no need to tip 
it's a bit out of the way  tucked inside a sort of mini mall on the corner of prince st and 37th ave   you wouldn't know it if you're just walking along the street   food and service were excellent   prices were as expected for flushing very reasonable   but you get great quality for less than quality prices   the popcorn chicken was delicious  an excellent accompaniment to the beers and sake that they had   i was surprised by the alcohol selection the ramen was also top notch  but at an affordable price   great quality but without spending $15 per bowl   i'm going to take my coworkers there tonight 
randomly dropped in as we were in the area and omg found an amazing gem  the broths were so flavorful   soft boiled egg tasted amazing  one of the best ramen bowls i have had to date this has become my new favorite place to have ramen
this is a new restaurant in flushing for decent beef ramen  i like the setting and the cleanliness of the restaurant  the place even comes with tv with sports channel on  i also like the appetizers here  the price is affordable  i would highly recommend this place 
very friendly staff  go there  seat yourself  they'll bring you the menu  you order at the register  and they'll bring you the food  no tip required but it's appreciated  very clean place and there's enough variety on the menu without being overwhelming  this is taiwanese style ramen  and they also have rice and dumpling dishes 
if you're looking for japanese ramen  this place isn't it  it is chinese noodles and it is absolutely amazing  the staff there is incredible  michelle is a sweet heart  i recommend the spicy beef ramen with sour cabbage and if you dont like spicy  the gyu kotsu ramen is so rich and flavorful  their fried squid legs are the bomb! i find myself coming back all the time  do try it out and do remember this isn't japanese ramen 
beautiful place! good food  good customer service! i frequently bring my friends here and they love it too!!my favorite ramen bowl is the guy kotsu ramen! the beef is cooked to perfection  and has enough vegetables and carbs for my diet!
2 stars for noodle  10 stars for braised pork rice 
i ordered the spicy beef ramen and it was delicious   if you love spicy food  the spicy beef will not disappoint   i paid $10 for the spicy beef ramen the place was clean and modern   there are flat screen tvs and free wifi from the restaurant   i went on a sunday late afternoon and the service was quick   i liked that i can order at the counter and go seat myself   someone will bring my order to me   there is a station where i can pickup my own tea  chopsticks  and condiments so i don't need to be waited on 
saw my friend posting about this new taiwanese restaurant that has a soft opening so i decided to try it out  started off with the cucumber salad and the marinated bean curd  both had just enough flavor to taste good and not be overwhelming  ordered gyu katsu ramen which was pretty decent  the soft boil egg was perfect and spicy beef ramen had just the right amount of kick of spice in your mouth  it also comes with duck blood which tastes just like pig blood  manager was very nice and gave us an extra dish of the taiwanese lu rou fan (meat sauce over rice) on the house  the meat was very flavorful and not over cooked  definitely hands down better than the other taiwanese spot in flushing  the service was superb  both the manager and the waiters came by many times to ask how the food was and offered to fill more soup if we wanted  manager actually tried to return tip to us claiming that they don't take it because back in taiwan tip was not necessary  staff informed us that they had a chain of ten restaurants in taiwan if we ever go visit taipei  will be back for more authentic taiwanese food and great service 
great place for ramen  it's cafeteria seat yourself type  no tip required  very friendly staff  will definitely come back 
first time trying this place because someone i know mentioned it to me  so i was curious and wanted to try this place out  the staff at this location was super friendly and gives you a nice local mom and pop shop feeling  the noodles were delicious and not that spicy  another good item was the taiwanese popcorn chicken  it was crispy with a nice kick to it 
these days we're rarely in flushing but we miss the authentic food  found a new taiwanese ramen restaurant  we ordered the a1 spicy sheng ramen and a4 72hr broth noodles  the spice level was perfect not overwhelming but you can really savor the heat and flavor  both were delicious  definitely will have to make a return trip to flushing to try out the other items on the menu!
i'm new to the ramen world but i love this place  inside of a large building that houses other restaurants and such  you'll find this place  you walk in  find a seat & will be given menus before you go up to the counter to order & pay  after they bring the food out to your table for you to enjoy  their tofu ramen is so good  haven't gotten a chance to try the other vegetarian friendly options they offer yet  this is a must visit place whenever i'm in flushing and need something to eat 
really good food ramen was awesome but be aware if you go they will give you the menu and seat you down but!! they won't come back to take your order you have to go to the register and order we spend like an hour waiting without knowing that little detail but lesson learned ant the end food was really good
they use fresh japanese ramen noodles  but chinese style  the noodles themselves are delicious  portion size aren't so big  but enough for a average lunch  the overall style is very similar to what you find in the food courts as a specialized chinese style  the restaurant is very casual  fast food like even though the establishment looks more like there's waiter service  tried a noodle with no soup base (minced pork and veggies) and the classic spicy sheng ramen  both were ok 
very friendly staff  i had the spicy beef rib ramen  the broth was very tasty   the ramen was a bit hard for my taste  would have liked it to be a little softer  the beef ribs were big and tender to the point of falling off the bone   i would definitely come back here again 
this place was awesome  i'm a big fan of ramen so called me  jaded!!! i loved the broth here  i got the spicy beef ramen because you know me  i love spicy    the broth was my favorite part  the tofu was a nice touch because i don't think i've ever seen that in a ramen  i love hotpot and it reminded me of that  overall  this is a great place in flushing for ramen  next time  i will look to try the sheng ramen since that is their signature  i will definitely come back and visit with my friends if i am in flushing and in the mood for ramen 
this place is ok  it took me a while to find it since it's located inside a shopping mall  once you find it  you'll see a pretty spacious dining area  when i got there it was late night  so there were only two tables with people  i ordered the traditional tonkotsu ramen  and got it pretty fast  (again not that many people anyways) i was afraid that it might taste very salty  as many places in new york are like that  but their flavor was just right  the noodle was decent sized  ingredients were what you would expect in this price range  and nothing really to complain  so overall it's just a generic place for people to dine  it's a calm and chill place for late night dining experience  but don't expect too much from this place 
a must try! had the a1 and it was awesome  perfectly cooked thin slices of beef  broth was excellent a nice level of spice and ramen had a great texture  the popcorn chicken was also a great appetizer  will definitely come back  we also ordered a4 and a5   both also had great broth and ramen cooked perfectly and one of those dishes came with an egg  we had never tasted such a silky egg like that before )note to self  add egg to future ramen dish)  the rice with meat sauce was very yummy  can't wait to bring my baby girl to try that  so overall excellent food experience 
just went here for the first time and ordered a pork and a vegetable ramen  both were very tasty  filling   and delicious  we've been looking for a good ramen place without having to go into the city all the time and this may be the place  will definitely be trying them again 
decided to try to this place out  i was disappointed with the ramen soup  it was bland  the popcorn chicken and fried bun with condened milk was good 
it's a simple operation whereby you order and they'll take the food to your table  the ramen and broth are of high quality  and the soy sauce garlic wings are appropriately tasty  give this place a try  i bet you won't regret it 
do not get high expectation to try out just treat it like a fast food and there is many of fast food noodle shop around u can pick and lot better taste ! thats it !!
seriously best flavorful ramen i've ever  it's rare to find an awesome ramen place especially with unique creative flavors  employees were filled with hospitality and asked if everything was ok  i had the veggie tomato based ramen and it is awesome i wish i could eat this back in boston seriously 
i had beef noodle which is really tasty  also a side order of takoyaki  will recommend friend and go back to try others 
this place is pricy and the ramen is not that good  for the price of the ramen you can get better food around flushing  it's like a self service place  there is a station with free water and tea  the setting of the restaurant is really free and you just walk in and sit yourself 
first time coming here  the ramen is very unique and is not the traditional taiwanese ramen    once in a lifetime experience you shouldn't miss out on!!! you will never be able to eat ramen at other restaurants again
i feel so sick after take lunch in this restaurant today    i run to toilet six time all day   and i did not eat anything after their food until 10 pm  
super cute new ramen spot in flushing! the place is a little hidden but in one of the fresher established infrastructures in the neighborhood  the first thing i noticed was the décor  the restaurant itself is very appealing  gives you a subtle feeling that you're in taiwan instead of flushing  the staff is also super pleasant and helpful when providing recommendations for your taste buds! take note that this is more like taiwanese ramen rather than the typical japanese ramen (you can definitely get that feel after tasting the broth)  service is a bit different here; you order at the register but they still bring you your food  we ordered the marinated pig ear and gyu kaku ramen   the pig ears were a little bland  but the ramen made up for it  they also recommended the herbal tea and it was amazing   nothing like i've ever had before!
this place amazing literally  idk if she's the owner or what not but there's a lady late night super nice  oh man their noodles is great never was really into noodles but man idk if i was just hungry or what i finished that thing in less than 10mins  food is great  place is amazing  and the lady haha shes great
i love ramen but this is definitely not ramen  went in a weekend noon with my bf but didn't see anyone walked into the restaurant during our entire lunch  the food is nothing like ramen  i can't even finish it though i'm super hungry  also ordered tea and it tastes like sugar water  will never go again and will never recommend to any of my friends 
by all accounts this should have been a 3 to 3 5 so i rounded up for a couple of reasons   the taste was decent (good even) but not spectacular   i ordered the spicy beef ramen which lived up to the name as it was really spicy   i also had taiwanese style bean curd (豆乾）which was made right and was absolutely delicious    with the food was taiwanese beer which made the meal that much better 
checked in on 6 24 17 for lunch overall experience was mixed  service was fine and suggestive but the food was mixed pigs ear   tasted fine but the not all pieces were not completely sliced through which some piece ended up in clumps which was kinda of gross gyu katsu ramen   not great   bland but the thinly sliced beef was decent jajang w  minced meat dry ramen   it's okay   not great but the not the worst   smallest cut of bean curd i have ever seen and ate (if it was a little bigger it would make the experience better)   also  the egg should not be cold!  it was cold!would not go back again 
sheng ramen serves taiwanese style ramen so don't come here looking for japanese style ramen  i've never had taiwanese ramen so i was excited when they finally opened last weekend  on their recommendation we ordered the house special sheng ramen  it came topped with pieces of thinly sliced steak  beef tendon  fried tofu  and bean sprouts  we were delighted with all the toppings  the menu says spicy but it is not overwhelming  we could smell the exotic flavors of the soup as it was placed on our table  the broth doesn't have the rich fattiness of japanese ramen  instead it is rich in flavor and not too heavy  you won't feel guilty drinking the whole bowl  the noodles were perfectly textured and chewy we also tried the dry ramen with the sheng special sauce  it has a kick to it with the kind of tongue numbing spiciness found in szechuan dishes  i loved it!the staff was friendly and helpful  i learned from talking to the owner they get their noodles from sun noodle aka the secret weapon of america's best noodle shops  the restaurant has a nice coziness to it  strange as it is in the middle of flushing 
came here on a whim today as i was craving some spicy ramen  the best decision ever!! ordered the vegetable ramen to go  packing the food the way they did made sure nothing would spill  and it was absolutely delicious!! cant wait to come back here!! it is now my only go to spot for ramen 
ramen was a disappointment  the noodles tasted like supermarket bought  but their hot tea was pretty good 
escape the bustling flushing in this nice quaint spot  owner is friendly and helpful with suggestions  order up front  take a seat  and they'll bring the food to you we got the spicy dumplings and sheng ramen combo with the opening promo of cucumber salad and winter melon drink  the soup base is the same for both of them  dumplings were good proportion of pork to cabbage to dough  ramen was good  but it wains in comparison to japanese ramen shops  it's similar to the food court food but in a nice environment with healthier utensils  and better ingredients (i liked that the ramen had beef tendon bits)  priced well appropriately 
good thing about this ramen place is that it's not overly salty like your typical japanese ramen  i don't think the dishes were over the top and definitely not the best ramen in queens  the texture of the noodles are perfect  but there's something about the broth that doesn't cut it for me  the portion are closer to the smaller end and i was not full at the end of my meal  even after having their fried buns with condense milk 
popcorn chicken was done perfectly  ramen orders 1 and 4 were tasteless and had such little substance  way overpriced  would rather pay 4 6$ more for a real bowl  or 9 50$ less for an instant bowl 
i get sheng ramen for my dinner  and it was so good!!! i went around for ramen shop in flushing area and this restaurant jumped into my sight  the beef was so tasty that i want to order more beef in it lol!! i highly recommend this ramen store to all of you! the place was clean and you can get water at anytime by yourself  i'll definitely come here again!
food was delicious but was a bit spicy for my taste  however  i really like the taiwanese popcorn chicken  it was da bomb 
i got the braised beef and vegetable ramen and the bf got the gyu kotzu ramen as well as the spicy dumplings  the broth of both soups were delicious (and i especially like it cause it's beef based)  but i liked my order better  it was more soysauce y if you're into that  i also like that they have self serve water  tea as well as to the utensils and spices  we used their spicy butter on our soups and it enhanced the taste so well! we got just enough spice that we wanted  my boyfriend loved the dumplings  sweating from the spice but he said it was delicious and kept eating anyway  the place is nice and cozy enclosed in this building with a bunch of other new restaurants  will definitely come back here and try the other ramens and other things on the menu  i also really like the fact that it's more of an area that's away from the hustle and bustle of main street roosevelt  although  parking is still a hunt as you may already know of flushing  all in all  recommend you try it!
i saw the advertisement yesterday  and came today  didn't get disappointed  i highly recommend their signature beef ramen and fried chicken 
i went out of my way to visit this place because my friend recommended me  the trip was very worthwhile  i got f1 and b5  the soup was very rich and the portion for meat was enough to fill me up  adding on the dumplings were fire!! it was juicy and meaty just the way i like it!! definitely making another trip to this joint soon  strongly recommend this place 
i really like the taiwanese ramen that they serve here  it has just the right amount of heat and flavor  my favorite is their spicy beef with sour cabbage ramen compared to their dry ramen  i think their dry ramen packs a little more heat since it's dry  if you have room  their dumplings are a must as well! the taiwanese popcorn chicken could be better but my friends did enjoy how their basil was perfectly crisp and used as their garnish 
i never come to flushing but i heard good things about this little taiwanese ramen shop  they had two tvs playing american tv and taiwanese news  which was super reminiscent  it seems like a family runs this location  which is adorable  the woman at the register was very friendly  we had the popcorn chicken  dry noodles with shacha sauce  lu rou fan (not sure if it's on the menu  but it is the dish i get when i go back to taiwan  and it was incredible here)  dumplings  wintermelon tea  and one of the noodle soups  which was incredible  the broth was amazing itself  recommend!
ramen is average  gyu kotsu ramen was a let down as the beef was sparse and not very impressive   tonkotsu ramen was better  par with what you'd expect from other ramen joints the side dishes were actually a pleasant surprise  with the marinated beef muscle and taiwanese sausage a hit at our table 
amazing place! would definitely go back! highly recommend the braided pork over rice!
i had spicy beef ramen  love their beef broth and the frozen tofu   also their side dishes are very good   my daughters fight for the fried bun and marinated bean curd     hope they will open a store in manhattan 
i won't say the ramen and the beef rice soup taste bad  they actually taste ok  however  the small portion that they give bothers me that's why i have to post this comment me as a young male that weight about 136 pounds  have to order at least two dishes to feel fulfilling  i ordered the spicy beef ramen for my wife and the beef rice soup for my wife  my wife didn't like her dish so i ate both  and still left feeling hungry and needs to find another place to stuff my stomachs and that's $23!so i am not really satisfy  overall if they make the portion larger i would give a 4 star for the taste because it is actually quiet ok one more thing  the duck blood doesn't taste like duck blood at all! it is more like pig blood  it is not soft  and has pig blood scents  i eat duck blood since childhood  there is no way that duck blood taste like that  if you have ordered the duck blood  you will understand what i mean 
best taiwanese food ever    great price and very authentic  ordered 10 different dishes and none of them bad  words cannot describe its deliciousness 
had the sheng ramen and it was very delicious   i agree that sheng ramen is not like a traditional japanese ramen shop with stewed pork bone or shoyu broth  but this fusion japanese taiwanese deserves some recognition   the broth was spicy  flavorful  and had many different condiments within it   reminded me of a malaa tang  the duck blood was a nice touch and was not something i have had within a noodle soup before   also ordered a bowl of the spicy dumplings and it would have been a very good stand alone dish   overall  people complaining about the untraditional factors within this establishment miss the big point   the restaurant is creating a niche for itself that attracts flavors from taiwan and japan   sheng ramen is one of the few flushing restaurants that is bringing innovation to the flushing food scene   this fact should be embraced and encouraged for future establishments 
average ramen  nothing special  the ramen  broth and dumplings were bland  this place is a dime a dozen 
we ordered the a1 and b1    the a1 is their signature spicy soup noodle   beef is very fresh   soup is very tasty  and the ramen is authentic japanese ramen the b1 is a dry spicy noodle   if you like spicy then the b1 will not disappoint    this is a very unique noodle shop    i look forward to going again 
ramen with a taiwanese twist  got the gyu katsu ramen but was rather disappointed in their broth  for 72 hours  there wasn't much thickness to the broth but got a gamey flavor instead  to mask this flavor  i ended up adding their spicy butter and some soy sauce and vinegar  ramen had a good texture though and i appreciated the lime ice water  their taiwanese popcorn chicken was nicely flavored but nothing i haven't had before  passable but not memorable 
the service here is very friendly and social  then again my friend eats there a lot so they probably know him  the ramen is soaked in 72 hour and taste amazing  it is self seating and the water cooler is right there so you can get water whenever you want  it's small but quiet and has a friendly atmosphere about it
yummy taiwanese style ramen noodles and other taiwanese food staples such as braised pork over rice and mapo tofu over noodles will keep me coming back for more   try the iced red tea!! simply delicious!
decided to be adventurous and came here for lunch  to say the least  i wasn't disappointed  i got the sheng spicy sauce dry ramen (b1) and it was delicious  portions are good and for the price  the ramen is definitely worth it  if you live in the area or you are visiting  it's definitely worth dropping by!
i stopped by for lunch with my boys and we ordered the gyu kotsu ramen  dry ramen with spicy sauce and the rice with meat sauce    all three were simply delicious   the broth of the first ramen was flavorful and rich   the spicy sauce delivered the heat and was bold  my picky four year old devoured the rice and meat sauce in minutes   we ordered different noodles and more of the rice for takeout because it was that good!  the staff is friendly and efficient   so happy we tried sheng ramen during the soft opening and can't wait to try the rest of the menu   oh and be sure to try their spicy butter
i got the mabo tofu and it was solid  it hit the spot  next time  i will get a noodle dish  because the ones my friends got looked amazing 
fresh chewy noodles in yummy broth! yes!spicy enough to satisfy my "spicy craving" yes!food with fresh ingredients my little ones actually liked and ate! yes! they ate up the soup ramen a4  rice with minced meat and boiled eggs  that's a winning combo any day!definitely will be going back to try all the other things on the menu 
today is their soft opening  it was a great success  the food that we had was delicious! we had guy kotsu ramen  braised beef and  vegetable ramen  sheng ramen (their signature ramen)  spicy beef ramen and steamed rice with meat sauce 
first time came here to try something new ramen was sooo disspoint at it first the cashier wasnt so not nice when im ordering i was order a beef bone noodle soup he give me the beef noodle soup i was like did i oder beef bone noodle？he say no u order beef noodle soup i say i was point at the picture front desk to order its ur problem made mistake order for me 。so can i change diff one？ no this already made u can not return ok fine can i get side order of beef bone then can u sell it？he say no we not sell beef bone alone u have buy the whole order wow i was like u made the mistake order ur not doing anything about it while ago i was eatting the noodle soup it was so salty not tradditonal ramen soup just like a satly chinese noodle soup i will never come here again look like they are a family store people who was figting in kitchen i front of dinning so rupe they dont care about the bussnines？once again dont come here eat ramen baddddd taste
great service  great food  love the ice tea and prices are unbelievable  
love the fried squid head for appetizer!   the ramen is good  very good soup base!  the eggs in ramen are superb  always want to order one more!
the food tasted okay  but the portions are very very small  it is too expensive for what they give you  the menu selection is also quite limited  i kept saying to myself that i could have ate a much better meal at congee village downstairs 
i would give it 3 5 stars if i could  the noodles are just ok  if you are looking for taiwanese style beef noodles  this is not the place  side dishes are just ok  fried chicken and the cleanness of this place are the only two things that could count as good 
food was ok  nothing special  this is a chinese owned establishment and cooked in chinese taiwanese style  the menu looked promising and b1 (pre set meal)  didn't enjoy their self made drinks and thought it was odd  the noodles were alright and ranges around $9 16 a bowl  i am still not sure how i feel about the beef    its basically the same beef you get when you go to a pho restaurant  also  the quantity of the beef was small and i didn't feel full after my meal  i got hungry 30 minutes later and got some dumplings on main street 
five stars for the braised pork over rice  excellent  one of the best i've had  had the taiwanese chicken and the spicy sheng ramen both good  great taiwanese fast food  quick and tasty  will be back 
not a bad place   its basically self serve   seat yourself  order at the counter  grab your own drinks  its nice bc you can do things at your own pace  i had the bone soup noodles with beef  its a decent portion size but presentation is lacking  i havent had a bone broth before so i cant say how well it compares to others  it isnt something memorable but its not bad either  they also have dry ramen which id like to try next time  the fried chicken app is good and the steamed spicy dumplings arent so bad although i think i prefer the spicy one 
to be honest  i was a little disappointed  based on the reviews and photos  i really thought the food would be very delicious so i went w a friend to try  however  the beef noodle soup was very plain  it's not tasty like japanese ramen or vietnamese pho  whatever they called their ramen is just disappointing  even the cucumber cold dish is plain  won't go back again 
finally had a chance to try out some taiwanese style ramen last sunday  had the a4  beef bone and ribs broth ramen  i must say  i like it alot  had also the gyoza  and fried bun with condensed milk   price is fair  not bad 
noodles are aldente and the broth is very tasty  the beef topping is okay  i like the salty egg  place is really cozy too!
great food  great staff  amazing clean environment  imported teas are to die for  very high quality of ramen  don't hesitate on anything!
love this place!! the ramen is authentic and amazing  and the people are absolutely wonderful! so kind  attentive  and very friendly  i highly recommend this spot for anyone who likes ramen!
location  flushing  place is clean and modern   i came here simply because of yelp wes' review  and i write my review to reconfirm how good this place is  if you are looking for a chinese bbq place  this is the place!food  had their potato noodle along with flavor everything  i was too full to walk off the restaurant  but i am happy  sauce is delicious  meat is fresh  flavor is spicy  and this is exactly what we had chinese bbq in mainland  oh dear  price  not expensive if you split with others  service  chinese and english  they know it all  overall  5 starsssss
i'm so disappointed   i had this place bookmarked because they were supposed to serve large premium skewers using real metal skewers   but this turned out not to be the case   only two skewers came on metal i went for an assortment of skewers and nothing really stood out   the lamb one was $3 and was the best of the bunch  but also nothing impressive   most of the lamb was fat   it had nice lamb flavor since there was so much fat on it  but the seasoning was lacking   i was hoping for some spiciness  which was not there nothing else i tried ended up being good   the chicken heart was tough   the chicken feet were really dried up and difficult to eat   the lamb tendon was cold   most items  even though they supposedly came freshly off the grill  seemed only lukewarm   and everything was seasoned the same way  that is to say underseasoned and without any of the nice cumin flavor you get from the stands in the end  it ended up costing me around $14 to try seven skewers   the price wasn't bad  but the skewers were nothing special   maybe i just didn't order the right items  but i've had much better from the stands on the street 
don't waste your time here  there's tons of great bbq places in flushing  i walked in and the lady told me it's only 20 30 minutes wait when in fact  it's 1hr and 30 minutes  i was on the line with other customers  and the lady supposed to call numbers by order  you know  like 1  2  3  4  instead  she yelled  "who wants to sit at that table?" and let last person to arrived sit at the table  people got very furious and asked her what's the point of the stickers if she don't  call by the number order  etc  20 minutes later  my number was called  but i have to share the tiny table with other customers? what? there's an empty table right there! i asked the lady and she said  "well  that's for 4 people  " then let two people who were after me sit at the table  i asked for an explanation and she tried so hard to lie about it  denying the fact  the food was very bland  not much flavor and the clam noodle has sands in it  disgusting 
lots of variety of food  skewer pot  pig's brain  spicy crawfish  wang zai hot milk are must tried  service is a little too slow  places are too crowded and noisy with no privacy  people lining up next to your table as they watch you eat  other than that  food taste good  great place for friends gathering 
authentic 串儿 place!! soooo good  two of us came for the first time and were pretty amazed by the selection  i loved the eggplant   aa菜   lamb and beef tendon skewers  make sure you specify the spicy level! it is also very easy to get much food without noticing  we were super full afterwards and saw a lot of people waiting for the seat at the door  with that said  plan ahead for the wait  we came at 5 30 for a saturday dinner 
came here on a wednesday afternoon around 4 30pm  the restaurant was a bit empty since it opens at 4pm  the staffs are very polite and they have a good menu selection  we ordered skewers  the skewer hotpot and the spicy stir fry clams  skewers  very good! we ordered beef  chicken  chicken wings  squid legs and fish tofu  they were all very good  no complaints  skewer hot pot  this is where i took off the 1 star  it's a cool concept to have a hot pot version of skewers  but i prefer the skewer to be grilled  the broth lacks flavor  and things kept falling into the soup base as we try to take the skewer out  it will be a pass for me  for $30  i would rather get more skewers  spicy stir fry clams  i wouldn't pay $14 (i think) for this dish again  it has a slime texture to it  and the clams itself is very small  too small for my taste  it also lacks flavor  overall  i will come back again for the skewers  but i'll pass on the hotpot and clams 
review for friendship bbq october 27th 2017 delicious xinjiang skewers! found this "hole in the wall" restaurant while walking down on union st with a friend looking for a quick bite on a  friday night  and boy is it a gem! even though the place was packed  we managed to secure one of the last tables and were quickly seated and provided with drinks  complimentary peanuts  and menus  from hotpot to chinese style cold dishes  their menu was pretty extensive  however  my eyes were on those bbq skewers  meat & seafood bbq typically will cost you $1 5 3 each depending on how many you get  they also sell their skewers in 10 to 30 count quantities  just keep in mind that the portions for each skewer are larger than you may think! and for those of you considering just buying a skewer from one of those roadside stands  let me tell you that every bite was well worth the price!!my friend and i ended up ordering shrimp  their signature xinjiang lamb skewers  chicken  shrimp  and squid skewers  all skewers came out piping hot and ready to eat  lamb skewers blew me away  huge chunks of meat sizzling in a cumin szechuan   like spice rub  delicious and probably downed that skewer in less than a minute  other skewers were fairly decent in flavor as well  skewers were slightly on the spicy side so it was perfect for a cold friday night other than that  i didn't really mind the decor  it was pretty standard  but the ambience was just right to satisfy my cravings for xinjiang style skewers!
the food here mostly consists of meats and vegetables etc  bbq on skewers  the food is pretty tasty and we enjoyed it  it wasn't exceptional or anything crazy but it was enjoyable  when we went there wasn't too many people here and the service was pretty good  the servers were attentive and quite nice  our food also came out quite fast which is a plus my favorite skewer here was the xinjiang lamb skewers  very tender and juicy! it's $3 per skewer and very big  the normal lamb skewers are $2 and i felt it wasn't as good as the xinjiang style ones  the texture of the meat wasn't as good also i recommend the enoki mushrooms and eggplant! they were very delicious  the egg fried rice is also a good combo with the meats  the price here isn't cheap though  it's about $2 for most of the skewers and the price can add up 
1  they have a post in shop which says there would be lottery every month if you follow their wechat account  but they never publish the lottery number it seems like they are using this to cheat customers to follow their wechat 2 bad service! people jump the queue but they just let them in 
this is a very decent chinese bbq place in flushing area   it gets packed fast during dining hours  and they won't seat ppl until everyone is there the oysters and giant clams were fresh & delicious   most of the meat skewers were quite tasty as well   the only negative was there was gas taste to a few specific items  since it wasn't cooked with charcoal they have more than just bbq and we will definitely go back to try!
first time here the food was amazing   prices even better   service was fast   let me say this if you ever had korean bbq you're in for a treat there skewers are amazing def try the chicken and the lamb ones !beef soup is also great will def come here again with more people !
super crowded and hot  flavor is good    but i had food poison within the two hour stay there  there is only one bathroom and ppl are waiting  its embarrassing  not coming back 
oh man  is this place legit or what?  don't bother with the hotpot  just go for the grilled meats  much more flavorful and the sauces seasonings were on point   the menu might seem a little intimidating with all the options  but just order a little of everything  there really wasn't anything that was meh or terrible   aside from the bbq stuff  the cucumber and cayenne peppers were fantastic side dishes   just be careful with the cayenne peppers  it is no joke how spicy they are   if you can't handle spicy stuff  this will literally incapacitate you   the beer tower is an amazing value if you're going with a group of people little miffed as a korean that they label the soju on the menu as sake    c'mon man   but that won't stop me from going back  will probably try some of the non bbq stuff next time   probably one of the tastiest meals i've had in new york 
it's the simple things in life that makes it all worthwhile  imo good food and even better company would suffice the evergrowing competition in flushing makes it difficult for businesses to keep their heads above water  so when we stumbled upon this place jammin late night  we knew there must be something we're missing out   service 4 5english friendly  wait time for 10 30pm friday night was 15min  be sure to grab your number so you don't loose your place in line  young  energetic  vibrant servers knowledgeable in the menu items  another plus to this visit spicy crawfish 3 5 5mundane crawfish stirfry  i would save my appetitie for the real thing the star of the show was the xinjiang lamb skewers 5 5  with huge chunks of lamb and seasoned to perfection   forget the bamboo sticks  they wrapped these meat cubes in tree branch which might be for the show  or might help accenturate the flavor of the meat  i have to say  the execution of the lamb was superb  big chunks of lamb can easily mask the flavor and be too gamey for my taste  but their secret to this perfection is zero gamey  yet soft chewy  perfect for my palate  to cut to the chase  order yourself some xinjiang lamb skewers  your tummy would thank you  rec  the meat bbq skewers 
it's a perfect place for late night food (4pm 3am) or for friend family gathering (to share food) i have been here twice and have tried most of its signature items  *skewer hot pot* i like the diversity of the skewers  it includes beef tripe  beef  shrimp  quail egg  fish tofu  fried tofu curd  chinese cabbage  fish ball  corn  mushroom and seaweed  the taste of the broth is not the most impressive part though  *szuchuan grilled fish*had this twice  what i enjoy is the taste of spices  however  the grilled fish tasted like fried fish; more vegetables would also be great  my friends were "fighting" for the few pieces of lotus and green vegetables  *xinxiang special lamb skewer*this is what friendship bbq famous for  the lamb tasted fresh to me  without the odd smell of lamb  i would assume that they marinate the meat very well  there are also some seafood items on the menu  it's hit or miss  for people who like the grilled  seasoned style  this is for you  for people who like the original freshness of seafood  you probably won't like this style as much as steamed seafood i may come back again if my friends are craving for it  but i may not initiate another dinner here since overall it's still a bit salty and a bit too loud in my opinion 
this is a hole in the wall! which is surprising because they are always jammed pack! when i came here  i just shared seats with someone because it was quick  the grilled meat skewers are amazing in every way! food here is price pretty reasonable  tbh actually the price here and cart prices are about the same  i would watch out what i order tho! some of the dishes are a hit or miss  overall  food and service are pretty quick  definitely would come back!
i've came here twice in the past month to difference experiences   i loved the restaurant the first time due to a combination of great service and delicious food  meanwhile  the second experience was bit of a let down due to the lackluster service  although the food was still pretty good   here are some of the items we've tried spicy hot pot with 30 skewers   the first time we came  i've asked the waiter whether we can substitute any items and he said we can substitute anything we want with the caveat that the items in group a would be pricier   we ended up not doing any substitutions so that we can try all of 13 items   we found out that we only like a few of the items  such as the tripe  beef  quail eggs and the fish tofu  all of which were in group a   when we came the second time  we asked if we can only get items from group a and pay extra if necessary   however  the waiter emphatically said no substitutions   it was a bit annoying that the two waiters were contradicting each other  particularly since the menu has listed the a la carte prices for each skewers   overall  this dish is a great deal  however most of the items were just not very good  particularly the corn (they use the starchy kind of corn and is just mushy)  the seaweed knot and the vegetable rolls (which is just scallions wrapped in tofu skin)   we ended up throwing out 1 3 of the skewers  which was a waste   i don't think i would order this again unless they allow you to tailor it as you wish and just charge a la carte prices grilled skewers xinjiang special lamb   the best skewer here!  it is the most expensive meat skewer  but oh so worth it   it comes on a gigantic tree branch looking skewer and the meat is seasoned to perfection   moreover  i love the perfect balance of fattiness of the lamb  this is hand's down my favorite lamb skewer in flushing gizzard   second favorite  although they ran out of it the second time we came   the gizzards were grilled to the perfect amount of chewiness other skewers we've tried included the squid  fish tofu  sausage  pork skin and beef tendon  all of which were well seasoned and cooked we've also tried the stir fried string beans  which was super salty for my taste  but the rest of my group loved it and finished the whole dish the price here is reasonable with each skewer averaged around $1 5  which is what the typical skewer trucks parked around flushing charges   it is a great deal to be able to sit in a restaurant and enjoy delicious skewers for the same price as you would get from food trucks   the only drawdown has been the inconsistent service   as i mentioned  our first experience was impeccable  the servers came by to check on us  refilled our water glasses  made sure we cooked the hot pot properly  etc   in comparison  our second experience was extremely lacking   the hot pot over flowed and spilled the boiling hot soup all over the table   we had to flag down the waiter to give us extra napkins   we helped our waiter to clean up the mess  but he just left the dirty napkins on the table  which was a bit of a turn off   moreover  it was difficult to get their attention to refill our water  as well as to order extra items   perhaps they were short handed during our second visit   overall  i think the food trumps the inconsistent service and would definitely come back again 
came here to try this place out on a friday night  the place was packed but we managed to be seated after about 15 minutes  we order sausage  beef  lamb  tendons  jelly fish  mackerel  and crawfish  everything was delicious and definitely did not disappoint  the beer were also inexpensive  the only thing was we wanted to order a pitcher of beer but was told that it will not be cold so we ended up ordering individual bottles  i wouldn't recommend the jelly fish dish  it was not worth the price  overall  i really enjoy how casual this place is  i would definitely return to try the rest of the menu  for the four of us the bill came out to about $100 
best chinese skewer bbq in town for sure!people who work here is very nice  they don't rush you to finish  or  hand you the check before you finish  i believe i've come here at least 6times last months  it's a place where you can enjoy the authentic bbq while chatting with friends or having a late bite after long working day  they also have a private room in the back it's available for 14 people i think 
took well over an hour to drive here from newport nj  but that xinjiang lamb skewer made the trip worth it  in hindsight  i would have skipped ordering the other skewers and small dishes and devoured more of the lamb  so reminiscent of cold wintry nights in northern china 
bbq so goodservice sooooo badhence the 3 starswe waited for an hour then they ran out of lamb!!!! like waaaaht?!
solid and fairly authentic chinese bbq in flushing  this place can be really great with a group of people with their large menu and drinks too  might be the best chinese bbq i've had in nyc  definitely come here if you are looking for something a little more authentic 
authentic northeastern china style street food and regional foods!!! guaranteed! so i went there earlier with eight friends  and ordered a whole lot table of food  really enjoyed it  you can get as noisy as you want with beer  bbq  grilled goods  and northeastern style pickled cabbage hot pot with pork belly  and the best crawl fish in a long while dining over there makes me feel like tele porting me to a summer night having street food and beer and chattering at a little bbq stand  so nostalgic 
i don't trust yelp with 4 star reviews anymore unless they are over 300  500 reviews ! almost every place recently that i trusted from yelp reviews have disappointed  this place has good looking picture but please don't let them deceive your eyeballs ! please ! the quality of meat here is a 1 10  the spicy broth may look good but tastes absolutely gross 
really doesn't taste good there   ordered the $30 for 30 skewer hotpot   it was the worst skewers ever  some of the skewers has only two tiny cabbage and the black mushroom was so mushy   the soup base was horrible   definitely a rip off item to order there 
if you have a chinese tongue then this is not the place for you  i feel like there are probably better places in flushing  the grilled fish was pretty average  the grilled eggplant tasted like plum sauce  and the sesame oil duck tongue was not so fresh 
a friend recommended me the place  average $30 $40 per person  highly recommend northeast pork bones  tsingtao beer  lamb bbq  tendons bbq  eggplants the spicy pot which cost $30 was not that good 
this place is legit  wife is from northern china  and we've been all over to the skewer places in la  they have their spice down  and meat is cooked very well side dishes are pretty good too  may be a little different than other places but everything was tasty and fast  open late too 
great hot pot   bbq place in flushing  good selection of both  good food quality  not the biggest place  and sometimes a bit of a wait 
the food is ok but the staff aren't very lively and it takes a long time for them to notice you if you want something  the food is also not really fresh either but the seasonings are the best!
i asked the waiter to bring my high chair for my baby the moment that i enter the restaurant   and they didn't bring me right away  after a little while i asked them again  and they told me that some other customers ask for it and they only have one which they came after me  i told them i ask first  and they gave me excuse like i don't think you daughter can fit in  i told them i'm sure my daughter can fit in  so they finally brought it to me my daughter spilled some of her cookies on the floor and the waiters came and complain to me which they can just dust it with broom real quick  all the restaurants i went  this is the first restaurant that would complain to me for which a baby would do really normal  none of other restaurants had ever complain to me before for things like this  and i usually would tip them good because of this!finally come the best part that we asked not to put spice on the grilled whole egg because it's for my daughter and they said ok  but when the food came it was cover with lots of pepper and the grilled whole egg was the size of my finger (same length and think)  it tasted like rubber bend  the $3 banana was literally grilled banana with some sesame on top of it  the grilled chicken we ordered was not even cut  the pork intestine was like all fat and soft till the point i only took one bit and never touch it again  the $16 lamb soup was soup with lamb meat that is only like a few dices in it         the whole time me and my friend were laughing because we never see food that is so unbelievable horrible like this  so we check out and went to a dessert place right away       
the place is bad  the service is no good  don't come  $$$pricy and you be disappointed   (
this is a great place with north eastern style of hotpot and bbq  as a vegetarian i was delighted when i found out they had bbq vegetarian balls i was estatic  i also loved the eggplant and sourcabbage  great flavours and as its awesome that i didnt feel left out despite that im vegetarian since most bbq optios are carnivorious  would come back again for the sour cabbage hot pot 
authentic chinese bbq excellent food and service  menu price is fair  variety of drinks  i would definitely recommend it  remember to bring few friend to enjoy the food and the atmosphere  is a great way to experience traditional chinese culture
the food presentation was just as amazing as the taste  i recommend the oyster and the eggplant dish  the only flaws i found were that the wait time in between the dishes were extremely long  i'm talking at least 15 min because of how busy it is 
i like to eat this bbq the taste i love  the service is very good and will come again next time 
the food is delicious but be aware that there usually is a long wait  tiny space  and one bathroom stall for everyone which was dirty when i had to use it  for the food  i recommend the garlic eggplant and grilled sesame buns  simple but deliciously charred 
the food was average  but the experience was terrible  i ended up to pay 30% tips because the waiters and the manager were nice  but the waitress in there made me sooo embarrassed  she had bad attitude and very unhappy face  and didn't apologize for what she did  kept arguing  arguing    i don't think i will ever go back to this place again if she still works  never tell friends to go 
terrible service  we wait for a long time for filling up water  it cost too much time for waiting this night  and the food is just okay  not such fantastic as ad shows 
this place is not cheap  the special beef stick that they claimed is kobe beef serving for $1each was super tiny  there were like 4 tiny little meat hanging on the sticks only  we ordered bbq food and the taste was okay   a lot of cumins and peppers  the sautéed conch was terrible  i am pretty sure it was frozen conch and it felt like eating rubber band 
the attitude of waitress is soooo bad  we have waited outside for about half hour for a table but the waitress skip our reservation by stupid reason  i would not go to this restaurant any more 
love love this place  the decoration  the food and the overall ambiance  the place is packed and waited for 30 minutes to be seated  it was bearable especially the skewers are just so so good  the eggplant is to the point i terms of moisture and garlic  the lamb is excellent  ) would come back to this place again 
if you want some great meat skewers then this is a place you don't wanna miss  i gotta say if you want to try the best meat in the store order the item call ahn tsu on or basically bbq baby chicken  sound horrendous but don't hate it before you try it  i thought it sounded cruel and unusual as well but after i tried it goddamn did i fall in love  the baby chicken was so tender and juicy that you can taste the juice flowing out  it as sauced and flaked greatly so that every bite you take is savory and heaven like  with each bite you'll want more and more until you realize there's none left! this baby chicken thing is a meat to die for  definitely try it out  the lamb meat skewers are average   kinda fatty in my opinion  sometimes you would get huge chunks of fat in your mouth and that's just plain nasty  i also ordered fish tofu  string bean  cold chicken  which basically all just taste average  only reason i'm giving it a 4 star is cuz of that baby chicken  goddamn that was good  oh don't order the noodles  it's bland even tho it looks spicy  you can try it  but i can't promise you'll like it 
frozen clams  dry bbq  one restroom  ingredients not fresh  service is alright  another young and popping place after midnight that serves less then average bbq and sautéed spicy dishes that comes out warm 
if you are deciding between this and shang shang woman  and wondering if it's worth the wait  i am telling you it is  the food is great  service fast and waitress are very responsive and professional  definitely will come again 
this is the perfect spot for a late night meal since they don't close until 3 am most nights  my boyfriend and i ordered the hot pot skewers  beef skewers  and chicken skewers  the hot pot skewer deal comes out with a gas grill with the pot of uncooked skewers  it takes about 5 minutes to cook everything  we enjoyed the variety of the hot pot skewers and the taste of the spicy broth itself  however  there are just some items that come with the 30$ hot pot skewer deal that we did not like  if you know what you like  then we recommend just ordering what you like  if you don't know what you like and just want to experience something  then order the 30$ hot pot skewer deal  disclaimer  not everyone likes skewers in hot pot broth; some may prefer grilled skewers  the chicken skewer was average  but the beef skewer was good  the servers were fast  attentive  and super sweet  they do have a button on the side of the wall to call your server to your table  expect to pay around 15 30$ per person 
i came here twice in the last month  the food was great  especially the bone marrow   coming out all hot and ready to be eaten  my favorite was the lamb skewer and the chives  i will visit here again  make sure to call to reserve a table   the wait here are long 
waited 1 5 hours to get our table but once we got our table the food came pretty fast actually  we were able to finish everything we ordered under an hour lol  portions of everything are pretty descent we had a lot left overs and the cumin crescent bones are the best thing on the menu  definitely recommend to y'all 
i was at friendship bbq with my cousin last friday   the food here mostly consists of meat and vegetable skewers either they cook them for you in bbq style or you can cooked them in the spicy broth yourself    we got there around 6pm and got seated right away since the place was not packed yet and we were so glad that we got there early because by the time that we left  which was 2 something hours later  there was a line waiting outside  the food was tasty  the bbq skewers are all very well seasoned and cooked to perfection   highly recommend the eggplants  the lamb bbq and the tendon bbq as well as the edamame with boiled peanuts  would definitely come back here again 
fried noodle sooooo bad pork intestine smelly no good  and undercooked anyway the bbq  is bad
came for the bone soup but they ran out at 6pm     all the bbq sticks are bland  doesn't even have the bbq taste   sorry but i will not return again   would rather spend money at those street vendors  gave 2 stars because the edamame was decent 
great food    the oysters  roasted eggplant  and cucumber salad    outstanding!  excellent informed waitstaff was generous with information for first timers  thank you and we look forward to returning soon
authentic chinese bbq place very nice staff price is fair lot of variety for drinks definitely recommended 
amazing!!! i have tried this kind of barbecue several times before   but i don't want to go anywhere else except for friendship bbq now!!!
located in downtown flushing  and the service was friendly also the food was fantastic  this restaurant are making traditional chinese bbq  as you can find a lot chinese bbq in flushing but this one is the best for my opinion 
highly recommend place for bbq  the food there is great and very tasty and with reasonable price!
great food! extremely busy    went at 9pm waited a while but worth it  the food is spicy but amazing  i had the special lamb which was my favorite     very quick service!
came here around mid night  and it was busy  don't not order their draft beer  so flat  craw fish was definitely not fresh at all  it's crawfish season you would assume they will get their live crawfish daily from the local supermarket  grill squid is average  but i really like their grilled fish and the  big red stick lamb is absolutely amazing  a must get  the egg flavor is good  but i think it's worth the price you pay for 
it's the good place to eat chinese bbq！the food really fresh and delicious also the price is very reasonable！
it's the real northeast bbq taste ! eggplant and the special garlic oyster are really good ! good place to go especially they open till 3 am
i like the spicy clams  the bbq is not as good as bbq cart outside  but more expensive than bbq cart  and the skewer hot pot  very salty but no spicy  and my beef back straps were cold when they put on my table  very disappointed and expensive  won't come again 
taste soooo good !!!  i want to be here every week ! there oysters are biggest i ever seen
i came here with 2 friends on friday night at 8 30pm  we made a reservation but will had to wait for about 15 minutes  the waiting area was super packed  and once we entered  we were shocked that the restaurant space was huge! we ordered lots of vegetables  shrimp paste  one meter beef and fish  we had the half non spicy soup base and half spicy  the medium spicy was wayyyyy too spicy for us  next time we will order little spicy  overall  i will definitely return back  this is one of the best hot pot restaurant i've been to in new york  oh  they also have some wine collection and it's very reasonable priced  *keep a look out for your plate and glass cups  some are dirty  i had to ask for a new glass cup because there was still lipstick stain from previous customer *
this is a beautiful decorated place  the reason for me to give 2 stars is because the spicy soup base is way too oily (may be it's authentic but i really can't tolerate the oil) i wouldn't recommend spicy soup base for girls who are in the diet  we went there several time  every time there was one friend end up with diarrhea and i felt the food is over priced waitress and waiter were very kind and friendly  however i felt they need hire more staff  we kind the been ignored  servers were so busy  after several attempt  i did't even want to bother 
i was very excited to come back to nyc to have some hot pot  unfortunately  we landed really late so had limited selections  i was excited that this place opened till 2 am and had great reviews  the restaurant looked nice with old world feel  we got seated in the middle area somewhere in the corner  food was pricey but it was ok cause i was hungry  although i was annoyed that i had to pay around $3 so i can go make my own dipping sauce (it did come with unlimited fruits but that's not the point)   however  no one came to take our order or bring us water for 15 20 mins  finally a waitress came and got our order but still never brought us our water   the food came and it was good but we had to waive down the waitress to bring us our water 30 45 mins in  also  our pot was boiled down to a cup of soup left and no one came to refill the pot  so all in all decorations was unique  service sucked  food was ok but not worth the price  btw  it was not that packed if you were wondering 
what a beautiful restaurant! decor is stunning and it really makes you feel like you stepped into a classy house in ancient china! this place serves up authentic sichuan hot pot like their spicy broth  it was no joke! my friends and i picked the mildest one but it is still pretty spicy like other reviews have mentioned  tomato based broth is perfect for non spicy lovers  the meat quality is noticeably a lot better than most hot pot places in flushing  fatty beef just melts in your mouth  their homemade shrimp dumplings and meatballs were really good as well  during the middle of dinner  there were performances! a puppy dog costume person and all staff members started dancing to an upbeat song  they were in sync with their dance moves  that was fun to watch!at the end of the day  the bill does add up but i thought it was worth to try it at least once! they do a surcharge for sauce is definitely wild but it's not unheard of  i have been to a hot pot place that does that as well  just tasting the authentic broth  i did not utilize the sauce bar at all 
spice world has always intrigued me and been on the list of hot pot places that i have wanted to try out  flushing is honestly stepping up their hot pot game   from small shabu shabus to extravagant hot pot locations  anyways  spice world definitely makes it on the list of "top" and "must try" hot pot places in the city  there is always a large crowd of people waiting to be seated  every single time i've passed by  for a table of 4 5  we waited approximately an hour and you will not be seated until your entire party has arrived the decor here is extravagant and honestly makes the whole restaurant feel so boujee  first  while you wait you are offered free asian crackers by the host hostess (try this  they are extremely good!)  a popcorn machine which gives fresh popcorn and they also have some type of juice dispenser all which are free!! you get a paper with a number on it and the host hostess calls your number to be seated the inside of the restaurant is even more lavish and is way bigger than you expect it to be  there are private sections for parties and celebrations  but the general area has an amazing ambience and reminded me of decorations back in hong kong  the air immediately is clouded with amazing flavours of hotpot  you will walk out smelling like hotpot (my clothes lingered with the scent until i washed it)  they have a large variety of soup bases and different levels of spiciness  they charge $3 per person  per sauce so hopefully you choose a broth which is flavourful enough that you don't need to pay additional for sauce  the sauce bar also has appetizers like edamame and cherry tomotoes i recommend the premium beef ($17) which comes on a large paddle and fish tofu  they don't have basic hot pot vegetables such as watercress or spinach which i thought was a little disappointing  the food is very aesthetically pleasing and your eyes definitely eat first! although i think everything is a little bit on the pricier side  i think that the portions are way bigger than they normally are at other locations and everything seems very fresh as well! the service was okay  there was a language barrier since our waiter did not speak english well but the food did come very quickly  they also charged us for something that they neglected to bring out and they rectified the problem without any issue which i appreciate  they also have a little entertainment during certain times (some masked guy was dancing throughout the restaurant)   i enjoyed my meal here and would definitely want to come back to try other things!
easily the best hotpot in flushing if you know what to order for your bucks  broth was super flavorful  fresh meats veggies fish roe meatballs! expect to pay $45 $50 per person  full meal but could get this satisfaction somewhere else for around $30 the servers weren't the best with english so we had some troubles ordering  our table mentioned no lamb to the server due to the smell  but still ended up ordering the special broth that was recommended that had a very strong scent of lamb  so we used only half of the pot   the watermelon slush is straight up watermelon  no ice  no sugar added only one house made noodle on the menu seafood combo was not worth  you get one lobster  a few oysters  few mussels  and about 2 red clams!
hey yo hotpot is one of the heartiest meals you can have during the winter time  what's better than sitting around a pot filled with broth and boiling in your favorite foods? yes  eating the food  i happened to visit spice world (香天下) while in flushing  and i was pretty darn impressed  how impressed? well  if eating here for 4 hours straight is any indication   firstly  this restaurant is located on the upper level of new world mall  the interior of this place is spacious  judging by the popularity of this restaurant  i'd say it may be crowded during peak hours the menu style here is à la carte  which means you are paying more than an ayce restaurant (extra charge for sauce garnish station)  no worries though  because the portions are ginormous  i wish i had know this before ordering  otherwise i would not have been chomping away for the amount of time i stayed  chomped 1  beef and lamb combo   the sliced beef came out on a long paddle board!2  mushroom combo   the enoki mushrooms here were so smooth and buttery  3  red shrimp   i thought that there was a mistake with the order  because these looked more like prawns! the flavor on these were exquisite  4  prime minister david cameron's favorite pork meatball w  cilantro   skip this; you're paying mainly for the name drop those were just a few notable items  but i would suggest keeping the orders to a minimum if you're in a small group  if you're a fan of the numbing  spicy mala flavor  go for the spicy soup 
spice world is a excellent hotpot location in flushing  the food quality is amazing  the service is good to great and there are semi private rooms for big groups  spice world also has performances that are really cute such as dancing teddy bears (for girls and kids) and entertaining (changing face mask man) we went here for a family member's birthday  and we feasted! we made a reservation for 10  the room was spacious  semi private and we had two large shared hotpots  there was a window towards the stage  so we could watch the performances pro tip  there is a special deal if you prepay a set amount ($300)  they give you a special discount on some of the items  we ordered two yin yang soup bases  tomato and pork bone in one pot  and tomato and spicy sichuan oil soup base  sauces are obtained at the sauce station and costs 2 99 a person  what's nice is that at the sauce station  you can get cherry tomatoes and fresh fruits to end your meal we also ordered  house special tripe (2)  hand made beef meatball  homemade style crispy meat (fried pork belly)  crab stick  fresh ox tongue (2)  premium sliced beef (3)  arden lettuce  tong ho (2)  king mushroom (2)  prime minister cameron's favorite meatballs  tricolor meatballs (2)  sponge tofu (2)  pork neck (3)  and hand made noodle  the meat and vegetables were so fresh and beautifully arranged!! my favorite were the homemade shrimp balls  the crab stick and the pork neck  the shrimp balls were springy fresh and so delicious! the crab stick was oceanic sweet and soft  it was amazing! and the pork neck was a crowd favorite  it was springy  arranged in a beautiful flat circle  savory and juicy this was a wonderful time! great food  very entertaining  very good service  the waiter constantly refilled the hot pots  sometimes  they spilled but it was ok  the lemon water was in the room  there were fresh cups and bowls  lots of napkins and chopsticks  i will definitely return  with a large group!
i was expecting a long wait so i came prepared  waited about an hour for a table of 4  you just pick a number and check in with them once in a while  i'd say the quality of meat is really good  we came for cny dinner so the atmosphere was right on   they had performance with large teddy bears and all waiters joined the dance also  sauce is an additional $3  make sure you try the "original way"   oil   scallion   garlic  they will make it for you if you ask someone at the sauce bar 
my friends and i came here to try out their szechuan hotpot after being enticed by the eye catching decor and how delicious the food looked in pictures here on yelp  if you're a big fan of spicy hotpots  then this is the place for you  spice world offers various types of soup bases for your hotpot  my friends and i settled for the regular spicy level which was still pretty spicy considering the amount of szechuan peppercorns and red chilis that were in the soup base  they also offered additional oil in cans on the side  for those of you that aren't big fans of spiciness  they also offer a tomato based non spicy soup base here  quality wise of the ingredients  they were pretty much on point  my friends and i tried a variety of the different meat offerings on their menu and was pleasantly surprised overall  the meats had a decent marbling to them and the shrimp paste was delicious  also for an additional $3  you also have access to the sauce bar which provides numerous sauces  as well as access to fruits  although there were several options for sauces at the sauce bar  i think they still had fewer options than your typical ayce hotpot place  overall  my friends and i were pretty much impressed with our first experience here  the wait staff were courteous  the decor was wonderfully constructed and we all left happily fed 
tip  you can make reservations on opentable!definitely one of the best hot pot experiences i've had  we got a ton of food including the most popular meter long beef  where it's actually a meter long plate of beef  however  i was sad to see that the homemade cucumber with garlic was gone that many mentioned in their reviews the ambiance of the place was definitely awesome and they have a live stage where people usually perform  this time  it was a traditional chinese folktale playing off a projector  onto what i would call the highlight of the meal   the broth  the traditional sichuan hot pot broth was 90% oil and peppercorn  which was super spicy and more so for my partner than me  but the other broth  the tomato broth  was the best broth i've ever had in my life  i drank so many gallons of that broth by itself  it was that good  i was definitely scared to try it at first as most places make it so bland or way too tomato y  not here meal value (from 1 10  my measure of quantity quality of the meal compared to price)  9many have said it's on the pricier side of hot pot and i don't find that to be the case at all here  maybe if you mainly eat at ayce places  but the quality here is top notch for what the price is  you really can't beat what this place has to offer 
im really trying to wrap my head around that 3$ fee for the sauce bar  how do you expect ppl to eat shabu shabu wihout sauce tho??? the food is already exp do they really have to charge 3$ per person for sauce?? smh the food was overall good  nothing special    i guess i paid the $$$ for the interior   combo soup is 20 each and the other 2 was more than 20 but its single soup  we only ordered 1 plate of beef and lamb cambo  1 plate of handmade shrimp meat ball the rest of the 7 plates were vegies (fish tofu  frozen tofu  taro  winter melon  mushroom  radish  and noodles all ended up costing 35 per person  we were a party of 3  35 may not be too much    but all we ordered was vegies and it was already in the 90s$    rather just go to dolar shop  cheaper but just as good and its personal soup there  so if you like personal soups try there!  )
i looked forward to eating here but it was not what i expected  the soup base was too oily and spicy for me  i ordered mild spicy which was still overpowering  the decor was as beautiful as pictured  sadly  the show starts around 9pm  i didnt get to see it  i also found that one small bowl of premixed dipping sauce isnt enough for table of 4  the waitstaff is busy and i had to asked for water like 3 times  otherwise they're ok 
spice world is an adorable spot to grab hot pot  the decor is aesthetically pleasing to look at and it's a nice environment to be in  it is more on the pricier side & i feel like they overprice their ingredients  they also charge you $2 each to make the dipping sauce   in all my years of eating hot pot i've never seen a place charge you for sauce but that's beyond me  the oil fat butter bear is adorable but it definitely makes you feel guilty watching all that msg melt in front of your eyes  the tomato soup is also pretty bomb  warning  they don't play with their spices here! it's szechuan hot pot after all  the juices they have are all yummy and great palette cleansers (albeit overpriced)  the grapefruit one comes in this very extra box and woven bag also  they don't give you ice cream  most places i know give you a free dessert at the end  don't expect that here 
def one of the best and most authentic ox oil szechuan hotpot! very fresh ingredients and generous portions  great service too
this place is as authentic as you get in new york as it's the same sichuan hot pot chain from china  many comments said the soup base is 90% oil and peppercorn   this is how sichuan hot pot is supposed to be   there are actually many many hot pot varieties in china  which actually makes sense  since it's a massive country  however  not from the sichuan region  i found the hot soup base too spicy and oily for me   nothing wrong with the food itself  but just not my taste  the lowest spice level here is like a medium everywhere else  so be aware if you can't tolerate spicy food; order half spicy and half non spicy instead  in hindsight  that's what i probably should have done  everything tasted good  decor is pretty on point too  my compliant is that they seem to "sell out" a lot of dishes during lunch  we were not able to get some dishes that we wanted to try as the server said "they are not ready"  i was a little disappointed to see other tables arrived after us were actually able to get them  they definitely should be more prepared  price is on the higher end  four of us  probably got too much food  ended up paying $180 incl tax and tip 
it's located inside the new world mall  not a easy find  i was there late at night so the main entrance to the building was already closed first impression when i sit down  the place is beautifully decorated  makes you feel like you are sitting in the middle of a ancient chinese village as i read through the menu i thought "wow  this is definitely the most expensive hotpot place i've ever been to in ny " everything is $5 and up  which can add up pretty quickly  one good thing is that their portion are slightly bigger than other hotpot places  i definitely recommend coming here with a group of 4 or more so you can order more dishes without having to pay so much  food wise  everything they sell is all natural according to them  i had the spicy and tomato soup base  they do taste more natural than the other places i've tried  but the soup is extremely oily and i don't enjoy the flavor very much  i was feeling bloated for the entire following day overall not a bad experience  but for someone who's new to the flushing hotpot game  i recommend trying some other places first before coming here  tips    good for group  they have private tables   portions are big  they charge $2 99 pp for the sauces
this place has its pros and cons but overall happy with experience here  first  there is likely a wait here even with reservations   we had reservations and still had to wait about 20 mins  pros most rich broth ever  got tomato and spicy and i've never had a spicy soup so spicy at any other hot pot location nice atmosphere decorshows  entertainment every so oftendrums to sit in while waiting good for large groups cons charge a $3 00 sauce charge per person sauce area had watermelon oranges cucumbers that were not refilled often poor service  waiters kind of inattentive and never had water refilled during dinnermany food items sold outno individual hot pots  only to sharelarge chairs make it crowded for large groupsoverall i would return to try the other soup options since those were the most flavorful soups i've ever had at a hot pot location
disappointed waited over 2 hrs because i heard good stuff about this hotpot restaurant  maybe i shouldn't have come here during christmas lol ordered triple delicacy pot & spicy pot combo  the triple was lack of flavor   spicy pot was sooo oily and yes i know it is suppose to be oily but it was overly oily  oh yea  it was also sooo spicy too sauces are charged by amount of guests  ingredients was okay    not that fresh  there were a couple of items that they gave to us that we didn't order and some of them never came too space are pretty spacious and big  there were performance every hour and you watch them dance  sing or advertising alcohol  pretty loud in there  so if you're someone who doesn't like loud places you would hate this place  never coming back again    1) waited for so long; not worth the wait  2) soup base was bland  3) ingredients were not fresh  4) no more fruits at the end of our menu because they ran out and also bc they were preparing to close 
you know   trading a free dessert for a favorable yelp review is against the rules of yelp  i'm just saying  ive come here a few times before since they opened but most recently came with a friend who likes taking photos of food  the waitress saw and approached her  saying if my friend wrote a nice review on yelp and uploaded her photos  we would get a free dessert  after our meal she asked if my friend had published a review  and she didnt (surprise)  no dessert for us  one less fake review for this yelp page  i had a draft written up with 5 stars  but i'm taking stars off because i found that bold request to be appalling  who does that?shady dessert for 5 star yelp review trade aside  i "loke" this place  i like it more than liking  but dont love it  somewhere in the middle of the two  the decor is fantastic  the staff have always been nice  and the food is very good  not to mention  an epic sauce bar full of yummy sauces (and all the free edamame  cherry tomatoes  and melons you can eat!) and tomato broth will always win my heart  now for the downsides it's a bit pricey for hot pot if youre not a big spender  the pot of soup itself is $20  that doesnt even include all the stuff you will order to cook in the pot  most hot pot places charge a soup fee per person  therefore  if you go with a big group  the soup isnt expensive at all  if you go with 2 people  youre paying $10 each for the soup broth  that's more than soup at the soup man  or hale and hearty  or anywhere the selection is small and not for unadventurous eaters  there arent as many menu options as other hot pot places  and they serve a lot of animal parts as this is a more traditional style hot pot  its cool and all unless youre against organ eating such as myself  tripe seems to be the most popular on the menu but thats a hard no from my american palate  they are vegetarian friendly with a nice mushroom platter though!! my favorite  unless you hate mushrooms  then you're just out of luck the sauce bar  as much as i like it  is $2 99 per person  unheard of  they have melon  cherry tomatoes  peanuts  and edamame for picking so if you're a fan of those like me  fill it up and get your money's worth  if you don't want the charge  that's alright too since at this place  the broth is so flavorful that i find i don't use much of my sauce anyway  which is rare since we all know hotpot is all about the #saucelife  those with citrus allergies beware  its death at every turn  all the juices contain citrus (which they offer even after you mention the allergy  pro tip  pomelo=citrus)  and the water has lemon in it so you gotta ask for water sans lemon and the employees just look at you weird  they do have sodas and tea in a can if you want to drink that  but they're warm  its rude  but bring your own drink to stay safe  all in all that's pretty much all i got for you today  i will still be a patron here since this place is great but please  no yelp trades  thats just so       ugh 
my review is on food nothing much exciting there   we order lots of staff  over price  even we pay $105 plus $15 tips for 2 people  still we have to pay extra for rice those little chinese sauce it's come for free   you have to walk to one place pick up by your self and you have pay for it   and   staff don't know nothing have of them don't know how to speak english at all  and the rude also   it's just some soup place   there u have to buy all side order and put in soup   all of them not cheap   before any make journey here check there prices   the will rip you of at the end   bad experience not recommended to any   more better   place in same neighborhood!!!!!
a friend of mine told me to check this place out and it's a very cool spot  imagine crazy good hot pot with equally crazy lines  i would say if you're going to come  budget about an hour of waiting time to not be disappointed  they do take opentable reservations but the last time i made it  i ended up waiting 45 to 50 minutes any way  i've heard they've improved since on meeting reservation times the interior here is stunning  you almost forget you're in new world mall  the spicy hot pot here is actually spicy  so be cautious when indicating your spice level  medium is plenty good if you're a heat fiend  i recently tried the tomato broth as well   i think it goes excellent with the spicy; especially for the vegetables i recommend the meter board of fatty beef  tripe specialty (big picture on menu that screams order me)  pork meat ball and cilantro  ox tongue and love the shrimp meat ball  they now have spinach  classic and i forgot what the last one is awesome addition to the neighborhood but to be positive   less wait everywhere else! spice world is also open quite late  so if you're hungry at night or want to have a shorter wait   things die down after 10 pm 
best items are tripes  tofu skin and ox aorta  meat is  meh  crispy pork is horrible  i strayed to get really tired of the spicy pot after half an hour  so i guess control the amount of food you order and it will be a pretty good experience  service is weird  they charge 3 dollars for sauce (why not just add that money into soup base? that would make me feel better) our waitress is really confused about what she needs to do 
i made reservation a week beforehand so i don't have to wait at all  the place is too popular so you'd better make reservations way before so you won't need to sit outside for hours waiting  the indoors decorations is really nice and very authentic  they also have show during the dinner which is interesting  the hotpot is good  all the food is fresh  but i'm satisfied with the soup broth cause it's not spicy enough  if you love spicy   then this place might disappoint you 
i came here with my boyfriend for dinner on a sunday night  we had to wait for about 30 minutes before getting seated  the place was pretty crowded  i highly recommend going with somebody who speaks chinese  there was a variety of soup bases to choose from  we got two soups that were both non spicy  then they bring you a homemade sauce  which was decent  however  we didn't realize that they charge you extra for going to the sauce bar to make your own sauce! despite that  the food was pretty good and the soup was delicious! i'd definitely come back here again 
it's my second time ordering here and the first time i really enjoyed it! the delivery was on time and the delivery man was wonderful! the food however was too spicy and i found a hair in it  i wouldn't order from here again 
i came here one night because it freezing outside and i was craving something spicy and hot  i was looking forward to this meal because i heard good things about it and the yelp reviews looked pretty good  i left this place feeling very angry and i told my boyfriend that i did not want to come back  first off  what kind of place takes open table reservation but makes you wait 1 hour?!?? i'm not even exaggerating   trust me i wish i was  when we first got there  the hostess told us to give a couple of minutes to clean up  after 15 mins  they told us to wait another 10mins  then after our third time asking  they said sorry but we are going to have to wait about 20 30 mins  i understand it's a new popular spot but if you are going to make us wait  be honest and straight up about it  if i was told beforehand about this wait  i would have sucked up and gotten a small snack in the mall or something  but no  they were unapologetic and looked us dead in the eye like nothing was wrong  mind you  it's 10pm at night  if you cannot honor reservations  you should be taking open table reservations  by the time i got seated i was so angry that the food didn't even impress me  the place looks very nice  very cool looking inside  the presentation of the food was on point  they do random shows during the night  it was entertaining  i'm sure if i was in a better mood  i would have enjoyed it more  btw  it's very loud in there  if you want to enjoy your dinner in a quiet ambience  then you won't like it here 
this place is one of the best hotpot stores i have been to for quite a while  although the price can get a bit pricey  but the sizzling of goodness and the decor of the restaurant   a+! so as we walked in  we could smell the spiciness bubbling in people's pot and at the moment i was pretty much starving  luckily they offer some small appetizers at the back of the restaurant so i was munching on peanuts and edamame while we were waiting for our yuanyang guo  (鸳鸯锅)  we got the spicy soup base and the tomato broth  both were equally delicious!there is a saying that  "you get what you pay for" so typically if the quality and service is good  the price would be more expensive  the total for 2 people came to $110 including tax and tip  but i personally like to spend a bit more on good restaurants than on clothes ;)service here were friendly and attentive  they were patient and made this interesting sauce for us to try ( i thought it was a bit too sweet tho) hopefully next time they would have their homemade yogurt drink    but overall i had a wonderful experience here  will be back  d
i had no idea that this place would blow me away with an extraordinary experience  tried several hotpots all over flushing and this place stands above them all  great open dining room with private booths for a more intimate experience that's still open to the rest of the environment  dj on hand spinning some great records further enhancing the great time we were having cooking up our meats and vegetables  food was so fresh and they don't skimp on the portions  i was immediately thinking how much greater this will be when we come with a big group  make sure to try the  lamb  i think it's the leanest and tastiest meat on the menu 
first time at sprice world  all i have to said the food is good!! and love the style of the place  i was going give more star   but service there are not good!!and no restroom in the restaurant!
honestly  i've heard many good stories about this place  i just dined there tonight and waited one hour to be seated    fine  as long as it was worth it    but was it? nope  i mean at first i sat down with my family  the first waitress was excellent  she served us with kindness and actually cared about her job  i was thinking to myself  okay that's a good start  then came the ordering and the food afterwards  our original waitress no longer served us and we had a bunch of food runners or something  now this is the part that pissed me off  my family and i felt rushed in our entire experience there  the servers kept pushing food to our table and told us to toss this and that into the pot  look  i'm the one eating here and if i want to save a piece of marbled beef for later  i can  food was mediocre  not as highly expected as i have heard  then came towards the end that makes me want to flip out at the waitress  our last waitress came over to my table while i'm still holding my chopsticks and said  "check?" i felt i wasnt entirely finished but getting there so i told her  "sure"  she then came back with the check and placed it on my table and stood there  she waited for me to pay when clearly i'm still eating  i stopped eating and went to grab for my wallet but she's just standing there waiting for my payment  so i took my time and she eventually left to clean tables  but in the corner of my eye  i see her eyeballing my table  that's just sh!tty service  i've worked in the restaurant industry and you should never rush a customer into payment  so as soon as i placed my cash down  she rushed over  snatched it from me and quickly counted it as if i was going to short her money  i told her it's all yours  i left her 20% tip  it's not a crazy amount but in the service industry  it's well enough  after she counted the money she snatched  she just walked away  no thank you  nothing  not one word  just take the cash and leave  i think that action didn't even deserve a 10% tip  tldr; the whole experience has been rushed for my family and i  servers were inexperienced to the fact that they want you in and out just to make quick cash  i probably most likely won't being going back because of poor service  not everyone in flushing goes to a restaurant for good food    that was the older generations  newer generation looks for good food along with service  if you miss one  don't be surprised when you lose more customer due to a rushed service and not even a thank you in the end  well you're welcome to whoever served me towards the end and i won't be back because of people like you 
this just may be one of the best hotpot places i've been to! the interior was very pretty and classy  the beautiful decor definitely made my experience more enjoyable  clean and comfortable environments are essential for a good meal!that being said  this place is on the pricy side  so be prepared  however  i appreciate how the quality  presentation and cleanliness of the food was on par with the price  therefore i don't think i "overpaid"  my friend and i got the yuanyang pot (spicy soup base & tomato broth)  the pots are bigger than your usual pot and there are also slightly longer chopsticks to go with it  which made it very convenient  we ordered quite a bit and thoroughly enjoyed all of it! there are a variety of sauces at the sauce station  and while we were there  there was even someone all dressed up playing the chinese zither (guzheng)  which added more of an authentic feel and touch to the place  all in all  a great experience! it's a great little indulgence from time to time  so i will be back when i get the chance!
while on the pricey side of hotpot  spice world is an amazing place to share a nice bubbling pot of goodness with friends inside of the new world mall you'll find the entrance adorned with glazed tiles and a waiting section filled with little drums for you to sit on  the wait for us was around 30 minutes on a saturday night  while we waited they held several drawings for coupon vouchers  so they're keen on service inside is a large hall filled with tables that can seat 4 6 people comfortably  and several family size booths that could seat even more  my group went with half and half soups  one mild and the other extra spicy    i'd recommend skipping the mild  of the things we ordered  i'd recommend grabbing the regular sliced beef  wintermelon  and fish tofu 
heard so many good things about the place  we came at 5 30 to avoid wait but still waited an hour  each paid around $60 in the end  the service was terrible  the only time we saw waiters was when they brought us food  we had to change plates ourselves  change the finished food with new food ourselves  we had to get ice water ourselves  we asked for napkin 4 times  for $60  there got to be better service than this  food wise   it is okay  all four of us found it too spicy  all the plates that the food came with are very delicate and interesting  nothing outstanding i feel like the price we pay all goes to the decorations  i've decided to not come here again  if you look at earlier reviews you will see a bunch of fake reviews obviously written by the business 
this place is big with very nice decoration  we went there on a friday night  i made a phone call reservation at 7 30  and we got seats around 8 00 which wasn't that bad  waiters are super nice  i'll give service at 9 10  food  food are fresh but we didn't like the hot pot soup that much  we ordered a medium spicy one  it was too spicy and too oily  while we were eating  my stomach didn't feel good  on that night  the host surprised people with a sichuan face changing show  we had fun 
this is my first time eating hot pot in flushing! the environment is great  and the traditional performance during the dinner is fun too!we choose a mid spicy hot pot base soup and the non spicy base soup  each is good for us as a table for six 
ahhhh nooo  i feel terrible for rating it 3 stars since hotpot is my favorite food  i'd say the taste and spices were just not for me  the bear in the spice broth was super cute though so thats a plus! there was this ingredient that i typically hate  but is popular in szechuan dishes which in chinese is "hua jiao"  hua jiao has a numbing taste and i think that ruined it for me  i know people who love it so if you don't mind it  this place is probably for you! i don't love the nonspicy broth  but i didn't hate it either  it's a bit bland but still enjoyable  i find that the sauce makes the hotpot experience much more enjoyable but i couldn't taste much because of the numbing feeling i got in my mouth  the dishes itself weren't too bad  the beef was good  another +!
best hot pot ! beside their cool chinese traditional decor~ five star for their food and service!hope they could keep going with their good quality hotpot and friendly services ~^ we will be back~
it's the authentic sichuan hotpot that i expect for  compared to those other hotpot places in manhattan  spice world in flushing is definitely worth more try  i came here directly after i arrived at lga in midnight  so did not wait for long time  but i would say the long wait should be worth it  cuz it's not that easy to find a place where serves the most authentic hotpot  my fav piece is tripe  so fresh and delicious  highly recommend this place 
very famous szechuan chongqing hotpot chain in china now in ny  great interior design you would feel like you are eating hotpot in a small village next to mountains and waterfall  very pricey but definitely worth the experience  remember to bib yourself so you dont splash the hotpot oil on your white sweater  good selection of dipping sauce and free appetizers and fruits  waiting time super long  but if you are as crazy about hotpot as i am  you would show up 4pm at the opening bell and be the first party to be seated 
if you don't eat "exotic" parts of an animal (i e  heart  veins  throats  tongue  intestines) i would not suggest eating here for hot pot  it's rather pricey and not too flavorful  the wait looked horrendous if you did not have a reservation  i was told its about a 2 hr wait  the interior design is super cute though and very spacious  we had a party of 8 and had a room to ourselves off on the side of the center  there is also a stage in the front where all the waiters dance with bears to the chinese song little apple  i heard there were also face changing performances but we did not get to see this since it kept getting pushed later and later in the night (~10pm)  because of the focus on szechuan style  they give you little cans of different type of oil to dip your meats and such into since oil masks spiciness (the green one doesn't taste that good to me  just fyi  but the red was pretty good) what turned me off during the dinner was the fact that they did not have much of a selection of sauces  and the placement of the sauce station is tucked between the kitchen area and a wall   pretty awkward to be there in general  also  they refill the hot pots with water  not broth  that is so cheap to me and not cool  granted  this is the type of base that you would not want to drink  but still! water?! major turn off  would i come back again? no  i really do not think it was worth the hype  once was enough for me  i would much rather go to the dolar shop for fresh meats and delicious soups  or even spring shabu shabu for unlimited veggies 
i was really intimated to go in and order  the environment here is phenomenal  i am a hot pot person  and this place 100% satisfied my stomach and my taste  i've visited this place for like three times since their grand opening  and every time i found something new that make me love this place  the half and half is what i recommend for the soup  and the ox stomach is also a must have  not to mention the meter long beef and the prime minister meatball are all terrific choices (i heard that it got its name because cameron loved this one so much when he visited a franchise of this restaurant in china )the wait staff are well trained and are very friendly  you can tell their dedication in providing the top services and entertaining customers all in all  this is a must to go place whether this is the first time you vist nyc or you are a local foodie 
long wait   1 star   horrible service  the broth came and 15 minutes later we still have not received our food  impossible to flag down a waiter to refill water or get the check  why can't they just staff more  1 star  half the menu was not available and the waiter actually missed some of our orders on the paper because he was confused on what we ordered  1 star   beware! suggested tip calculates based on post tax amount! not pre tax 
jesus this is like eating in beijing  we were there at around 9 and there were 30+ people in front of us  we waited for 1 5 hours but it is totally worth it! the food is so great! the spicy one is really spicy  but it is so good!!! fatty beef is extremely thin  and delicious! this is the best hotspot i have ever tried in the u s 
this place is popular and new of course have to wait  but this place is worth the wait  despite making reservation in advance  and we still had to wait to be seated  we spent this time to checking their menu out and have the idea what to order  once we were seated  we were immediately greeted with drinks and have our orders ready pretty efficient  i ordered the spicy and non spicy broth  everything was fresh and flavorful  especially the 1m premium sliced beef and homemade smashed cucumber with garlic (appetizer dish next to the sauce)  they have their own spicy and sesame oil which was very thoughtful definitely recommend to check this place out 
had their spiciest soup base and their own pepper dipping sauce  the dipping sauce really makes a big difference but pretty much anything is good regardless of the sauce  probably the second best hot pot i've ever had and they have lots of things you normally can't find in other hot pot places in the states 
please avoid this restaurant! i went with my family on 3 11 to try their hot pot  i spent around $275 and was asked to leave cash tip  i left $50 in cash but when i checked my credit card statement yesterday  they over charged me $54 as tip  i tried to call the store to resolve the problem but no one answered my phone call  i will never ever go there again and i will tell all my friends and family to stop going there as well  the worst experience i ever had with a restaurant!
firstly i have to admin this restaurant is the best decorated in flushing   and their yin yang or half and half hot pot bowl is the bomb  really authentic! the "meter long beef' and " fresh shrimp paste" you must order them  and all other dishes are also very good  it is truly a great dining experience  highly recommend to all!ps  the garlic marinate cucumbers at the sauce station is reallllllllly good  and it is free   )
this place is authentic!!! the soup base is super tasty and spicy! that's how it suppose to be! meat is fresh  sauce is spot on  and veggies are clean and fresh as well  the presentation of all the ingredient is excellent! it just adds more excitement to the whole dining experience  however  there are some items that are not available yet  given they are brand new  i think it's understandable  the service is great  the wait is a bit long since it's really popular  i actually feel bad for the hostess since a lot of people were running out of patience when i was there  but she kept her smile on and handled the situation well!around 8 pm  the staff put on a dance show for us!!!! they danced to a funny chinese pop song and everyone was cheering! such an exotic experience if you haven't been to china  hahaover all  i give this place 4 stars and i would recommend this place to friends!
they will charge tip twice  very untrustworthy business  when you call and tell them the double charge  they told you the recipe went missing  how convenient! won't go there again 
good service  good food  very fresh and variety of selection  great for the taste of authentic chinese hotpot 
their hot pot with the 9 slots is popping in china and i have been super excited to try this place  i came here twice within three days and the first time was really good and everything was on point  food was good and service not so much  the last time i came here  it was horrible  i ended up giving up on eating because that was how bad it was  i came here with four friends and everyone just ended up not eating because we ordered spicy  but it ended up being spicier than medium spicy  the food is a little bit pricier and they might as well not even hire servers because all they do is stand around and talk  i ordered some food first with one server and thirty mins went by and the food never show  the second time got another  still the food didn't show  they had the audacity to charge me for it and tell me its on the way when i am already checking out  if it takes one hour for a drink and some cold food to come out  don't bother  very disorganized  but a cool concept p s what type of shit is charging $2 99 for a sauce bar  they say there is fruits and appetizers  but there is orange  rotten cantaloupe and peanuts  i don't know how they expect people to eat hot pot with no sauce 
the food here was good and authentic szechuan hot pot   there is a nice atmosphere and we enjoyed ourselves here  however  their service isn't very good and we waited a long time for our water to be refilled and a few other things 
this place has terrible service  for okay hot pot  at a very high price  my family and i decided to come here after an evening out and chose this place because they claim to be open late  when we arrived at 12 pm we asked to confirm if they open until 3 am  as they advertise  and the hostess confirmed  it was not crowded (only 3 other parties of 2 3 people) yet we were not acknowledged  or even given water  for almost an hour  we tried to call any of the staff over and but when they came over they said they don't speak english and before my mom could start speaking to them in chinese they walked away  when we finally put in an order at 1 pm  a waiter tried to tell us they are closing at 2 pm and we "need to hurry and eat " again  this all happened before we even received our food  and $3 for sauce? come on  there are tons of other hot pot places in flushing  if you have the option i would try any other place but here 
best hot pot i had in nyc! items are little pricey but the portion is very large so be careful when you order so you don't end up with too much food  love the tomato soup  most of the items we tried were great as well 
great food and great performances  a good place to hang out with friends  of course it can be very spicy lol
five star to the food but 1 star to the service in particular of the hostess  very unprofessional and unorganized  we first called three days in advance to make a reservation  reservation was made and confirmed  then we called the restaurant the day before to confirm the reservation and were told the reservation couldn't be found and then cannot guarantee the table but we would have to get there on time and there might be 30 40 mins of waiting time  we were unhappy with the inconsistency but we appreciated their honesty  the day we got there  a guy rudely cut our line and asked for table  we asked the guy to kindly respect others and wait for his term  the guy acted as if it were our fault  the problem was the hostess had no sense of judgement  she said "why do you want to fight with other walk in guests?" we were not fighting with anyone  we just simply arrived first and wanted to be helped by the hostess first! she helped the guy who cut the line instead of asking him to respect other guests! this is such a disappointing experience! we waited one hour to be seated! what a joke!
spice world has performances everyday at 7 30pm at night!! yu chen serves our table and he is so good at the performance!! will be back for both the food and the service 
this is a very good chinese hotpot restaurant  the service here is pretty good  nicely cut meat and great seafood  many different options  i highly recommend this restaurant to those who love traditional chinese food and spicy food!
came here once with my family after work and i am a fan i love the decor of the place  it feels like the moment you step into the restaurant   you have landed yourself in ancient china  i absolutely love the decor the food here is really good as well  our family came here a while back so i'm not sure what we ordered  but i remember that it tasted amazing  i do however remember ordering the chili oil fish (something like that)  which is something i order when i go to a chinese restaurant  it was good  the spiciness was just right  you get the spice  but not to the point where you have to drink water every five seconds will definitely come here again!
average food  with somewhat different vibe for a hot pot place  the wait was ridiculously long  which turned out to be due to the whole staffs "dancing time "  i understand that the dancing bear was to attract young customers but it was a bad idea having the entire waiting staffs dancing with the bear while our plates of beef was going bad without any soup on our table  we also got our drinks served after we got the check and were ready to leave  to make it worse  the manager(?) was too busy "disciplining" the staffs instead of helping them serve foods correctly and on time    i doubt that any of us will return here 
went there with a group of friends  i said this place is not worth of money  we came in non peak hour  service is not that great  there is a time limit  however  nobody notifies us  there is a bag for the clothes  but they didn't give to us  we asked for more soup about three times  the waiter passed by couple times  but didn't provide us  finally  the soup was here  hello  the soup is belong to the pot  not everywhere on the table! don't trust the review on the wechat!!!
spice world is my favorite hot pot  i like their oil sauce best  it's very authentic sichuan hot pot  the waiters are very nice and considerate  the decoration is very beautiful  when i was eating inside  i thought i was back my hometown  it's a warm and gracious place 
we went there on friday night  waiting was 75 minutes!the restaurant is so so so beautiful  very beijing style! i like this place!the only complain is the soup base!the flavor of the soup base is very very very important  especially the spicy one ! the soup base here is really so so!!!! not as good as dolar  or the little lamp  or the mister!hope u change or improve ur soup base!
one of the most horrible dining experiences i've had in a long time  so i had relatives visiting from overseas and decided to take them there to enjoy a nice lunch given how nice the decor was  the staff seemed cordial and everything started off smoothly until half way through the meal when we discovered extra flavoring in the hot pot   a baby cockroach  now i know roaches can be a common problem in most restaurant establishments  but what shocked me the most was how the situation was handled by the server  upon showing him our discovery  he nonchalantly took the evidence and scurried away  after that  no one came by to offer to change the pot (because really  who is going to eat after finding a roach floating in the pot?) or even a proper apology from management  when another server brought us the bill  we asked how come they didn't address the roach problem  then our server came and said the roach probably came from the vegetables not being washed thoroughly  he then reluctantly gave a 10% discount off the bill after i told him we took pictures of the roach (since he had already destroyed the evidence) and that management should have handled this better  all in all  the staff needs to be trained better when it comes to these types of scenarios  it's not like we're in china and they can just get away with stuff like roaches in food  we left with a sour taste in our mouths and will not recommend this place to friends or family after what we've just been through 
this is probably the best hotpot restaurant i've been to! amazing food (fresh  many varieties  nice soup base)  good service  nice ambience etc  i made up my own sauce by getting a little bit of everything just like how i usually do for any hotpot  but this one turned out to be the best taste and the flavor maintained the same throughout (usually i have to mix new sauce as i eat along because the flavor just fades away as i keep dipping)  i highly recommend their beef and fish wah  not an intestine or animal organ person  but their aorta turned out to be amazing!! i really like the setting design of the restaurant  along with the music  it really brings you the feeling of having hotpot in china!
very disappointing  ( horrible service and bad management  our server never came to fill up soup or water  the hot pot was way too oily       it's very different from what i've tried in china  most of the food we wanted to order were sold out at 7 45pm(魚扣，毛肚，成都串串etc  ）we had coupon for free fish buckle   obviously not available  the only substitution was watermelon juice  they also mistakenly listed the food that we didn't order on the check  what else  if you are using the 「get $10 off when spending $100」coupon  please pay in cash only  seems like their coupon deals are so shady   all four of us agreed that we will never be back 
the soup base is literally 95% hot oil   the dipping sauce options are very limited compare to other hotpot restaurants in flushing  the food quality is so bad  also 50% of the stuff on menu was not available  me and my girlfriend ended up paying $120 bill and left with our stomach empty  disappointed! i would give a 0 star if i have the option! expensive and bad quality!
place is huge and has traditional chinese style  if you go around 8 30 or 9 they have some kind of chinese face changing show its pretty interesting~ the food is awsome  you  guys should definitely  try it
this is definitely the best szechuan hot pot restaurant in queens  in my opinion  as of today we ordered yin yang hot pot bowl  with one side of spicy soup base & tomato on the other side   the soup base is authentic szechuan & flavorful   from our orders  i would highly recommend "meter long beef" and "fresh shrimp paste" as must have   for more adventurous tasting  try the pork intestines & tripes   all other dishes are also up to expectation there is traditional szechuan face changing performance during the dining hours   the service was attentive & friendly   with the amazing decoration  it is truly a wonderful dining experience as my last 2 visits  some seafood items were not available yet   regardless  this would probably be the number 1 place for me when it comes to hot pot   the only negative is the wait   it is always packed with many waiting here are the general steps of having chinese hot pot  1  order the soup base  2  order other food dishes  3  create your own sauce from the sauce stations  4  enjoy!
this is the best hot pot i've ever eaten in flushing  as a sichuanese  in a foreign country to eat a comparable home hot pot  i feel fortunate  the waiter is handsome guy service is very attentive  show us how long each dish eats  let me have new knowledge  oil dishes and dried dishes in other hot pot shop is not  absolutely delicious  particularly worth a try  the waiter will help you prepare the balm dish  very fragrant  we all had a second time  worth trying a hot pot shop  five star recommended
extremely bad wait waited 1 5 hours and did not get seated   they told me 45 minutes when given ticket   do not go there with our reservations   they will not seat you and make you wait all night long   45  1 hour  1 5 hours  2 hours no seat no food  still waiting   they are not nice
wait time is not terrible on a weekday around 6pm(got seated in less than 10 mins upon arrival)  nice ambience  staff are super friendly and attentive  the tomato soup base tastes so good but hubby said it's a bit oily (disagree) the self served sauce bar has pretty much everything you needed  overall i'm very satisfied  will def come back for more!
everything here is completely authentic as approved by my parents who go to sichuan all the time  you must understand how to use the dipping sauce the proper way and create your own sauce tailored to your needs  even the interior design is incredibly authentic  really traditional and elegant design try the nine flavor pot if you really like it spicy  but if you have people that are americans or children to feed get the half and half non spicy  only cook the meat in the spicy not the mushrooms and vegetables  you could dip that after you cook it non spicy  make sure you use at least a third vinegar to lower the spiciness in your sauce  you won't be able to take it if you aren't familiar sichuan  get the handmaid shrimp meat balls that come in the bamboo sticks  they are the best! there are noodles are hand rolled and fresh 
this is the first hotpot restaurant that i've been to that actually have performance  this restaurant really made chinese culture stand out  the food is amazing and they have the 9 box thing hotpot which i love  the place is just like walking into a new culture  it doesn't even seem like a restaurant more of a new spot to go to at main street  eating while watching the performance was amazing experience i'll definitely go again 
after reading the mixed reviews on yelp and some recommendations from friends  i decided to head to spice world to try  my first impression of the place is very mixed  the decor   i have to give it to them for decor of the place  it is beautiful and very unique  the front of the restaurant consists of little drums used as seats  which is a cute idea  the entrance is gorgeous and inviting  the interior design makes you feel like you are sitting in an actual restaurant in china  just beautiful  the seatings are benches  which is not really my preference  but the design and the furnitures are definitely unique  price   this place is definitely more expensive than any other place  i thought mister hotpot is expensive  but this place just beat it  the price does not reflect the quantity at all  for $3 99 i was hoping to get more than seven leaves of napa cabbage  but i got seven leaves of napa cabbage (yes i counted since it was so countable)  for the price you paid for each item you ordered  you would expect more quantity wise  soup bases   they do offer a good variety of soup bases  which is good for customers  i got the tomato and mild spicy soup bases  i have to say both soup bases did not impress me  the mild spicy soup base is super spicy and the tomato soup base is too sweet  i really couldn't enjoy cooking and eating the food in either soup base  service   i was very unpleased with the service from the hostess  when we first got there the hostess was not there to greet us and we waited about two minutes  when she finally walked out of he restaurant she was on a cell phone making reservation for the customer on the phone  that took about four minutes  when we finally got seated  the waitress asked to place our soup base order after we just sat down and getting ready to look at the menu  after we looked through the menu and checked off the items that we wanted we couldn't get a waitress or waiter to take our menu  i had to flag down a waiter to bring our order in  then the waiters got confused with whose food is whose and had a whole conversation on it  tried it once and that's it  it is just too pricey for my blood 
beautifully decorated place   good for group of people actually group is better you can get more food for cheeper price   its all natural they say which taste good   abit expensive if you go by portion   by its big portion   its located in the mall so u can shop and enjoy your soup
this is a new hot pot restaurant  the taste of food is delicious  i went with my friends  it's great  i recommend you to try it
nice service! no wait in weekdays  we got seated immediately  very traditional chengdu hotpot! love this place! the price is reasonable  just a bit higher  high quality meat and vegetables!
literally the best hotpot in nyc! the spicy pot      amazing! you don't need to dip in the sauce the spicy pot itself is so flavored  the beefs are great! and the bian lian show at 9 00 is epic! costumer service is great!
great service! beautiful dining environment!!! and i love hotpot   especial their spicy and tomato half half pot  so damn great  i am not a big fan of tomato  but their tomato base hot pot soup just so damn good!!!!
absolutely amazing and authentic hot pot  the spice definitely makes you dizzy but truly enjoyable experience  the menu has a wide range of selections  so happy that they've brought this to new york  a little bit pricy but worth a trial!
the close time on yelp is 3 00 am today  but when we arrived at 1 15  the waiters told us that they have already closed for no reasons  if you guys closed at 1 00 am   and then please put the accurate closing time on it  or it will waste people's time 
this place is horrible  it's unorganized  we ordered the spicy tomato base  the broth was not special  just like other hotpot places  everything is a la carte  including sauce  not so many selections  there is no pork on the menu  when we asked the server any possible to order pork  it was sold out and it was only 6 00pm  however  the portions were decent  the service was bad  you have to ask for everything you need  during the mealtime  there was an entertainment by the staff  it was annoying and interrupting  the only thing makes this place special is the interior design   i don't recommend this place to my friends  one time trial is enough  other hotpot places are much better than this place  recommend to make a reservation 
first time here  soup is really food  service is just as amazing  the place just fun to look at  if you been to china  you're gonna really like this place lol  did i just write this to get free dessert? maybe  but am i telling the truth? find out yourself 
this is probably my favorite place to go for hotpots  the soup is very good  my favorite is tomato and spicy  especially the tomatoes soup  it's the best i ever had
envirement  it's so good and clean because it's very busy so it's a little bit noisy but it's ok food very classic chinese hot pot flavor food are fresh and unique i'm pretty sure they got special things obviously you will never try in other place service   it's really nice  servers are nice and friendly don't worried about service everything is perfect!
if you want delicious and authentic szechaun hotpot  cant go wrong with this place  the broth was spicy and peppery as it should be  some people are complaining its too spicy  but szechaun food is known for being spicy  do what i do have some milk before eating  there are also a tomato broth  not spicy i think  food was fresh and there were a lot of options and good portions  the decor was just absolutely gorgeous seriously just check out the pictures downsides  its a bit more pricey then other places  and the wait staff was not the most attentive but that seems to be the case in a lot of hotpot places  also make a reservation or expect to wait a long time at peak hours 
very nice decor and some entertainment  the staff will perform small apple and a change face show which is very good   but the food was way too oily and too much msg 
here it is ! you think mister hot pot is a little over the top with it's non stop beat fest wait till you get a load of this cheese fest  1 2 hours wait sitting on barrel drums to begin this scratching your head journey  outer decor temple like with projections of their signature dishes soon to not be on the menu  upon calling out the post it number  i walk in to a dancing employees dancing to the famous song "little apple"  since it's been open for a few days only i guess the employees danced like they actually wanted to  but still superbly awkward  once sat was greeted promptly with a server  two small can of oil were put down but never explained on how to or should use on  so i ordered the combo base instead of the signature 9 compartment pot  wanted to try the clear bone broth  was ok  not great  the spicy however was the signature  thick  spicy and lots of herbs  little too much herbs in my opinion  then down to the ingredients  1  signature tripe is a big no  so tough need a saw to saw off 2  the farmer beef is also a big no  you might get a nice picture of the bronze like farmer but that beef in that two sack is the worst flimsy flaky chunk of bad meat  3  the shrimp paste however was a plus for the price  three bamboo sticks was a good portion  taste was alright  4  all the watermelon and mashed cucumber salad was a plus at the condiments stand  5  pig brain  only order if it's fresh  after two hours the bian lian master dancer appeared and the crowd went wild  dude went on stage and downed a bottle  threw the bottle down the floor and fled  i guess he was in a hurry to change and be that 6 foot ted bootleg costumed dude that's about to be in a pic with the birthday boy  employees sang all together while customers stripping ted apart and pass around the rip & dip sized bop head helmet to put on and take pics  closing in on closing they soon put on edc music  place was popping & banging  lights were lit & sparkling throughout the ceiling  a projection screen was soon placed on stage to enhance the experience just in case anyone can't make it to edc  after this two hour extravaganza  my heart can't take it anymore  it was quite exhausting for a meal  as fresh as it is and as hard as they try   it's was just slightly over the top   cheese 
staff are very friendly and helpful  the food is very delicious  and the environment is special  i will visit back definitely! it was very good experience 
really exceptional! no hesitation for a 5star  went there last weekend  the food was great  the design is insane  feel like traveled back in time into the chinese antiquity  and they had mask opera perfermance  damn! highly recommended! experience it for yourself  oh  one big tip  try to go as early as possible  because the wait is so long 
came here for dinner last week with friends and saw the interior was well decorated for halloween! it was such a fun dinning experience  i really enjoyed their friendly service  delicious fresh food (i think they changed the menu recently and have more seafood available such as shrimp  crab  lobster etc) and the fun atmosphere every time i came here  will definitely come back soon and more often when the weather gets colder!
visited about one month ago when it first opened  half of the items on the menu was not available  there's a "20 min" policy on the menu stating that if we don't get all of our foods within 20mins  we would get a meat dish for free  30 mins passed  i asked where were my other 3 dishes and if i could get the meat dish for free  the server told me those 3 dishes i ordered were sold out   okay    you didn't bother telling me earlier? since me and my friends were still so hungry  we ordered a can of coke   never came  asked again   never came   asked again    the server then told us they didn't serve coke    visited again a week ago  again  most of cooked dishes on the menu was not available  my friend  again  decided to order a can of coke (bad bad decision)   the coke never came despite we asked multiple times summary  below average service i'm giving it three stars because the foods are decent 
this is the best hotpot in ny  i'm here 2 time every week  food are fresh and the soup base is sooooo god!
good hot pot place to hang out with friends! good service and tasty food! if you are not sure about the sauce  the staff can make a house special sauce for you 
good decoration  very traditional sichuan style hot pot  price is medium  strongly recommended
great food but horrible service  i really love the soup bases here but the service is really bad  as an abc i really don't know chinese and because i couldn't communicate with the staff  they gave me attitude and barely waited our table  i had to constantly remind them of our orders and to refill our pots  i came here about 8 times till i got fed up of the service provided every time i came 
it is really a nice place for groups who's looking for not only good food but also relaxing atmosphere  the waiters and waitress are really nice especially yi chen  after knowing we missed the dance  he offered to perform for us one more time  will definitely come back even though i don't really eat spicy food! lol
i like the hot pot restaurant  it is the first space world in new york and it is the 613st in the world  guys  go to try this    it is prefect
i came with my husband and his friends  the decor of the restaurant is beautiful and the staff is very friendly  the mushroom broth is delicious and the food is fresh   however  the restaurant is on the expensive side for what you get  but  it is a great place to treat people for dinner or lunch due to the restaurant's presentation  for that reason  i would recommend this place to my family and friends!
have to admit  this place was okay  the broth was pretty good for the hotpot  however the spicy one was rather    more oil than spice  i wouldnt have that again  but the original  non spicy one was pretty good  noodles were good  service could use a bit more work  took us a while to get our seafood combo and soup refilled 
the food is good  good quality beef  veggie and seafood  soup base taste good but at the end it become more and more oily (ppl said that's how it suppose to be  so no complain) only problem is no service! starting when we were seated until we leave  basically nobody served us  we have to kept look for waitstaff  overall is ok  i don't think it's worth the 2 hour waiting though 
came here sunday night and waited for more than an hour and a half for a party of four  but the wait was worth it  this is a traditional chengdu style hot pot  with a special twist of sesame oil in a black can  just put ground garlic and this magical sesame oil with cilantro  your food would be amazing! would definitely come back again  and the good thing is that they close at 3am in the morning!!!
this place is awesome  especially the special performance  the waiter yi chen danced for us!n
this is absolutely the most disgusting place i've ever been too! i would give this place zero stars!!!! the hostess is from some villager from mainland china  her attitude is horrible and it seems like she's working at a market! why does the hostess not speak any sort of english  making reservations on opentable??? forget it  if the hostess can't read  they know it's a reservation and has x amount in the party along with it taking place at a certain time  then she called my reservation  i promptly went to tell her it's my party and we are all here  she tells me it's not me! like how you know it's not me that you're calling? i pulled up the open table reservation and she completes ignores me and just says it's not me  then someone else claims to be the person she's calling  she didn't even verify the last 4 of the phone number and asked her partner hostess to sit that party  that party was a group of 6 she called for the group of 7  she obviously can not count! she then had the audacity to raise her voice at me? excuse me  the last time i checked it's you who can't read and if your boss adds the restaurant on open table  best you know what the f' you doing  1 out of 6 individuals i've encountered here understands broken english  why is the rating so high in this place  must've ran some promotion to get those reviews  i've never experienced such service  such disappointment in a highly rated place  spoke to the manager whom a guy claimed he was  explained the whole story from beginning to end and he apologized  then immediately set up the next table for my group  if he didn't find anything wrong with what the hostess did why he immediately sat my group  even when the table is a little smaller for my party  he even changed our table when a bigger one opened up  came by and personally asked if we needed bags for our jackets and all  with all the bad experiences aside  this place is okay to try once but i won't go back again  i must advise if you enjoy being in a loud chinese market this is your place right before you walk in  the dim sum hosts are better than this!
this is ​my favorite​ hot pot restaurant in town  although​ it is in flushing  ​i can travel thousands of ​miles for delicious food  im a sichuan girl  so i know what i eat  first of all  ​space is beautiful  it is very cinematographic ​and it is authenticly​ renovated  i heard that many of the interior parts were exported from china that is​ disassembled from a real ancient chinese​ house in sichuan  and i love to see any business owners not only care about the food but the culture​ behind it   taste  speaking of sichuan style hot pot  this is the most authentic place you could get for it!​ the soup base is delicious  they offer few types of soup base  but i always get the spicy one  or sometimes  if i come with my friends who cant handle that much spice  then we will get the divided pot with non spicy soup base on the other side  either​ one  they are all yummy  price  the price is more expensive than one of those buffet style​ hot pot obviously  but the food quality is also way beyond them  so it really depends on what are you looking for   since this is the best hot pot restaurant in my eyes  i think it is worth my spending service   i read some people had a ​bad experience​ with the hostess​ or waiters  well  ​i have came here for at least 10 times  i have never experienced that  all the waiters are very friendly and super nice to me and my friends every time we came here  they would also explain​​ to us (mainly to my friends) how to food certain food  im going there this weekend with some friends again  and we cant wait!
i am one of those person that barely write reviews on yelp and the only reason i am writing this review is to show how terrible the hotpot experience was! ordered some shrimps which did not prepare properly and had to ask the waiter several times before the guy added soup to our pot! and then all the sudden  someone bought us the check just because we excess our time limit! which  nobody told us about when we were seated  this is one of the place i will never visit again! such a waste of money !!!!!
impressive decor hidden in the new world mall   great ambiance  you don't feel like you are in flushing   delicious hotpot  creative selections  good service  wait is long so try to get there before 5pm where there's no wait   2hrs+ after   glad to see beautiful chinese establishments in nyc!
must place to come not only for great hot pot but also for entrancing chinese dancing and performance  base soup flavor is delicious 
one of the best szechuan style hot pot around new york  highly recommend for people who likes chinese hot pot!
portions  8 10service  5 10 (we felt like we're on an island  no one attended us for a long time and anytime we wanted service  i need to tell two people what i want and i'll be lucky if one of them brings it back)food  8 10 it's becoming one of my favorite hot pot placesprices  5 10 pretty darn high for hot potatmosphere  7 10 the decor was quite unique  nice 
i tried spicy herb soup hotpot  it was very good and spicy ! beef and vegetables are so fresh too! now here is my one of favorite spot for shabu shabu  )
yesterday with friends to ate hot pot it's wonderful time  the foods are good services are good  specially yogurt is really nice!
pricey and the pot was way too oily  even the non spicy pot was oily  you can definitely get the same or better quality of food in the neighborhood for less  besides the food  their service was great and there were snacks and drinks passed around while you wait for your table to ready 
do not  go  here worst service ever  we arrived 15 mins after opening and there was already a waitlist  so we got a number and waited about 5 mins and got a table  along with another couple who got the table next to us (they arrived a couple of mins after us to put their name on the list)  nothing against the other couple  but they factor into the story later  we figured this place must be good if they're packed at 4pm and there's a waitlist  so we were excited se we sat down  marked off our orders on the large paper menu  and waited   it took about 10 mins for the waiter to come back to both our tables and take our orders  although he realized that we sat first and took our order before the couple next to us  they received their soup first  then came about 2 3 plates of food  after about 5 mins of watching them eat  we got our pot of soup  and then we waited  and waited  and waited  we watched as the table next started to finish their first round of orders and another table of 2 across from us order  get their soup  and get all of their food   in about 10 mins total from order to food landing at the table  and we still waited for our food it took 30 mins after taking our order for our first plates to come out (including beef balls which were obviously out of a plastic bag and emptied onto a dish)  we waited an additional 30 mins for the beef & lamb combo plate   really   1 hour for a small plate of beef and lamb that i saw other tables get flying out of the kitchen and every other hot pot place as the first 2 plates that come out!needless to say  we complained after 15 mins of waiting for the initial plates and the waiter said they were new and its busy  ok  that's acceptable  another 10 mins and we asked the server again  who replied that they're busy  uhmmm   not really acceptable when everyone else around me has their food  so we asked to speak to the manager  after getting everything except for the beef & lamb combo  we complained again  same answer   we're busy  no manager either after we requested again i cancelled the beef & lamb combo 55 mins in  but they still brought it out 5 mins later  when i said i didn't want it  the waiters (2 of them) said that we ordered it  they brought it out  it's sitting on my table  and we should take it since we ordered it  so  we kept it to not make a scene finally  we finished our meal and asked them bring out the manager one more time to give them another chance  the waiter finds a supervisor after 5 mins and we tell them no  we want the actual manager in charge  after searching for 5 10 mins  the manager finally came out to talk to us  it didn't start with an apology or anything similar and we had to reexplain the entire situation to her for the 3rd time in an hour  she was smiling for a good 5 mins until we started to complain loudly  unfortunately  she didn't speak any english (side note  how did she get her food handler permit??) so my wife had to do most of the complaining  we ended up retelling our entire story for 20 mins before she took 20% off our bill  but they tried to sneak in a dish that was cancelled and the waiter took back 45 mins ago  luckily i checked the bill thorough and complained to her again when she was standing there  for the amount of time that she spent talking to us  no one else in the restaurant seemed to care that we had such a bad experience  our water glasses were never refilled for the hour and a half that we sat there  even though everyone else in our section got refills and the 5 pitchers of water were emptied (they were completely full when we sat down)  we asked the manager to help us get some container for the leftovers   nothing  we had to flag down the busser 3 times before we got the container and bag that we needed to pack our dinner some people reading this might think it's another internet rant  but check my other reviews and this is not the norm  i've worked in the foodservice industry for over 20 years  everything from dishwasher janitor to manager and everything in between  while also holding 3 degrees in restaurant management  i do have empathy for foodservice workers and try to tip better than average as i know how hard the work is  i understand mistakes happen  you're new  you're busy  etc  but  what i experienced today was ridiculous  it was worse because no other tables around us had this experience!
this place went a bit old traditional in the decor  i see drummed decorated stools littered across entrance and two ancient folklore doll paintings bringing you back to times of the dynasty at the doorway   then a mini waterfall  the hosts were in chinese robes but the servers were in aprons  the presentation is nice but as you dine you are shown the folklore of the monkey king on repeat while listening to some crazy remix beat of chinese rap mixed with current day americana hits  theme is a bit off   very confusing and i try my best to block out external madness because the food   it's hot pot  you really can't go wrong with food you cook yourself  we ordered a variety of flaming conch sghells  to hand served seafood pastes from the server at your table to the various cuts of meats and skewers of all goodness  the pitcher of watermelon slush was all pulp and little juice  the seating was on wooden benches and tables are oddly arranged  they also have canned flavored oils that are per serving  cool concept but then they also have the communal condiments section     so it's puzzling  this place is like the yin yang hot pot   hot and cold   they need to decide on one theme  seemed cluttered 
i tried a lot of spicy hotpot in china  this one is too bad  don't waste your money and time  totally below average level 
heard so much great things about this place so my friend and i decided to give it a try tonight  we went in around 11 30 pm beat the crowd plenty empty tables  the food is sooo good and fresh  we had spicy pot and all meat  service is great  staff are patient and polite 
food is ok  even though the waiting time is about one and half hour in average  but we was enjoyed the food  the worst part  really the worst part  the dj  i don't know why a restaurant want put a dj  it is really annoying and ruined my dinner time  the dj put the music super loud make me can't enjoy my dinner and just want to get out here asap  seriously  this is a restaurant not a bar  give customer a piece time for dinner please 
amazing decor; feeling like back in szechuan; authentic taste but very modern food presentation  meat ball  tripes，tender beef，pork aorta highly recommend！！ wish to live there!!!
this was a restaurant with very good food but average service   pricing was high as we chose a lot of items   i'd go there again but think there is better value for money for hotspot 
the service is too bad and waitress doesn't know their membership and give customers lots of misleading info 
they charge my card for 300bucks while i only consumed for 32 6 bucks  such an unethical business  shameful
oh boy where do i start  first things first i love a restaurant that takes itself very seriously  spice world cares deeply about the product it rolls out  dinner and a show with amazing ambiance  i hope this place becomes extremely famous because i can say very early on  this place is one in a million
2 stars for the food i really like the broth  i don't understand why they hire dj here  for what? it's noisy my friends and i can't talk to each others  everyone gets headache pls   it doesn't make sense to have dj in hot pot restaurant 
this place is the best hot pot in all new york   the special hot pot which they call it nine spot is amazing  good place for friend meeting or anything else 
never seen a hot pot restaurant like this in nyc  highly recommend! i believe spice world is the best hot pot here in nyc so far  the decorations and food are amazing! will come back soon 
decoration is very beautiful  the waiter's value is very high  very cordial service  as well as china's sichuan opera face  in the fragrant world to eat hot pot to find the feeling of eating hot pot in chengdu! very good!
the food there must have some safety issues  my friends and i all had diarrhea after having hot pot there  also there is no service  nobody came to collect empty plates or add water for us  awful experience!
i don't understand the hype  food was mediocre and overpriced  we ordered the spicy and tomato soup base  the spicy side ended up tasting super bitter to the point where we could only use the non spicy side  which was flavorless  i'm only giving this place 2 stars because it was clean and spacious  and the service was actually very nice 
best authentic hotpot in new york  detailed decorated environment  soup base is authentic chongqing style  recommend to every hotpot lover!
best hot pot i ever had!!! must try! this is the third time i'm here already  so addicted  the special interior design based on the traditional chinese chun style  the spicy hot itself uses their secret recipe and i can't stop eating 
it is good but not that good  service is perfect and the dance and songs are both ok  i give four stars because i have heared so much about it and dreamed a lot about it  i think it is in a same level as little sheep hot pot 
thoroughly enjoyed our meal  my son and i are adventurous eaters and tried the ox aorta which was very tasty   the decor is very nice and the wait staff attentive 
one star for the nice decor  all the rest should be no star  the soup base tastes so bad  nothing but peppercorn and oil  food was seriously overpriced  nothing special but expensive  service? there was no service  one hour during we were there  servers dropped whole tray of glasses ( right next to us)  plus whole tray of silverware  they didnt know how to to serve table  because they were kept walking behind our table but never fill up our drinks  not even ask if we need anything  we had to prove to servers that we didn't receive one of our dishes  they act like we can't afford that $16 beef tripe  serious food safety problem  right after we ate  we went right to the bathroom  and sick for two days 
this is the probably the best hot pot i had in the us   amazing soups  fresh meat   fantastic decorations  awesome service!
it is nice new restaurant with great service and tasty food in flushing  even though there is long wait but the food is delicious  so long waiting is worth  they offer the chinese famous show while you eating  the waiters are nice and trained  when you get some issue during you eating  the server helps you nicely  specially  there is a really nice manager but i forgot his name  it is glad that they are open in flushing 
great place to get authentic sichuan    hotpot   deco is fancy    dancing & changing face show is entertaining  will go back !    new place very popular so may have to wait but worth it
best hotpot i have ever had in the us  everything is really fresh  i went there with friends that actually from sichuan china  they all like it 
authentic sichuan style hot pot  wonderful sichuan opera face  the best place for family and friends
a fantastic place to have some sichuan spicy cusine  and to see an amazing chinese magic show  face changing  dont miss the great chance 
food and service so great there are lots of interesting show here that i've never seen before i'll recommend it to my friend and come it again 
i think this is the best hot pot place in flushing the decoration is so amazing and the food  omg so delicious u should give yourself a try!!!
4 5star! i tried this newest hot pot place in flushing this weekend  they are doing a trial currently and the line has been an avg wait of 1 2hrs  the decor is on point per my szechuan friend  resemble how szechuan look like when eating on the street  they have these old fashion tables and chairs(may not be the most comfortable) that really added to the character   food wise  it's a must try to have the hotpot with nine compartments(25per pot)  soup base goes from mild to super spicy and i would suggest people to order one level less of what they r used to because the more you cook  the spicier it becomes  def order their cow stomach  fresh and crunchy  of course pricy too  one other thing i would recommend is pork blood  it's much softer than the other places  otherwise i would say the food is standard  service was also great  very attentive  servers provided us with bags for cellphone and a apron if the girls are afraid of getting their clothes dirty  a very asian standard if anyone has been to hai di lao in china  now the price  i have to say it's on the pricy end of hotpot  it cost over 200 including tip for three people  it's not bad for the whole experience from decor to presentation to service every once in a while  but if it's purely for the food  it's pricy 
it's very good restaurant  top 1 in flushing  i like
a tasty chinese traditional hotspot restaurant  the interior looks amazing                
this place has one of the best chinese hot pot in america  we ordered half and half for base broth  half of the pot is medium spicy and the other half is non spicy  among all the dishes we ordered  the house made fish ball on bamboo sticks (three sticks in an order) is my favorite  mutton is good but not as good as little lamb mogolian also in flushing  tofu and frozen tofu are good  vegetable is good  and hand pulled noodle is a must  the selections of sauces at the back tables are quite complete from spicy to non spicy  one can mix and try all the different sauces to one's liking  the tables also have unlimited supply of melon and oranges  let me tell you  the fruit at the end is so refreshing after having had the spicy hot pot  the bill for the three of us including beers and before tips is about $90  which is quite reasonable considering the good service and nice decor 
the decoration of the restaurant is so good  actually they got really authentic szechuan style soup base  and they do have high quality service of their waiters and waitresses that was wonderful 
i would definitely give 5 starts for the service  but the food was terrible  i couldn't even eat enough of it to get full  the hot pot (spicey) was extremely oily  and perhaps we made the mistake of not getting anything else on the menu  but this does not sit well alone 
the best hotspot in flushing area  feels like in china   must try        highly recommend  
the traditional style of the decor  if you like spicy food i will recommend you to come    and the service was great!
table service is nice and fast  the food is tasty  the front desk recipient is terrible 
amazing place! delicious food! highly recommended place to go for hot pot at flushing!
yummy yummy  very good food  nice decoration and attentive staff  i love the kobe beef   also good entertainment like traditional chinese mask changing performance   the soup base is very spicy
today come back new york，my borther took me to come here ，was the first time come here。before i have the hot pot，this one is very yummy  like it so so much
think twice before you go! got food poisoned there!! went to er and missed work for a week 
if i can give negative stars i will，the base soup taste like plain hot water，the food is not fresh，like cheapest food when you get in supermarket，also the service is not friendly 
worst hotpot experience ever  first  i specifically asked the waitress for a non spicy broth several times  there was a language communication barrier which led to a half super spicy half non spicy hot pot  i was not happy with the spicy option  i understand that sichuan hot is supposed to be spicy  but i specifically asked the server to direct me to a non spicy option  second  and most appalling  after eating the spicy soup my 65+ father had an allergic reaction where he could not breathe  he got up from the table coughing and choking in the middle of the restaurant with his hands around his neck  no one came to help (not even the patrons)  the waitstaff ignored him and had the nerve to then overcharge us $3 each for two of us going to the dipping station once  another charge that the server did not ask us about  the cherry on top was the manager then coming over to us to rate the server  not even asking about how my choking father was doing 
very disappointed  beef and lamb does not taste like professional hotpot level  their recommended item is just ok  totally not worth one hour waiting  the hotspot base soup is not special but only spicy  no better than a homemade hotpot  the only one star i give here is for the decoration and marketing team as you will notice they post a lot of photos about celebrity's visits  but i am here for happy food  not for social media posts 
really don't know how they get high rank reviews  should have read the other one star comments before we went  it was similar bad experience  we got there before they open  and we waited for two hours  and they didn't inform us that the big table were all booked so there were no more tonight! what kind of retailers do that! the waitress said we should book one  but we called before  and were told they do not do reservation on weekends  then she said  those who relate to the boss can do it  wow  impressed  food is not that stunning  same as other in china town 
it's a wonder place for relax  the food is delicious and the waiter is very kind   will visit again 
it is very mediocre taste  but very expensive  $60  person  first  the spice taste is too strong  you could barely taste the meat  your beef would taste the same as your chicken  it is just all about spicy and spice  second  the spicy soup is fairly thick  you can't really cook your food well  overall   i wouldn't recommend go there again 
my new go to hot pot place  literally hot and new! my favorite is their mashed shrimp and beef  make sure that you have their shrimps as well! can't wait to come here again 
taste is just so so  price is higher than any other hot pot restaurants  taste is just so so  price is higher than any other hot pot restaurants  taste is just so so  price is higher than any other hot pot restaurants  taste is just so so  price is higher than any other hot pot restaurants  taste is just so so  price is higher than any other hot pot restaurants 
so amazing the food is delicious n server is nice they have special shows like dancing singing n acrobatic performance that is excited 
tried this place a few times  long wait cause it's new but definitely worth it! the food was consistently fresh and you can tell it's high quality  decor is very pretty too
amazing design! traditional chinese style with a lot of details  the food is good  got to try the tripe!
feels like you're in china! beautiful place  great environment and excellent place for hot pot  must try!
first time here  great decor feel like in china for sure  waiters services are great  my friend was here waiting for an hour  they said all parties needs to be here before seated which i understand  we all got here and waited another hour  that's when i got frustrated   we wanted to try special spicy pot  it was too spicy for most of us  we all eat spicy food on regular basis  not much flavor  also on expensive side as well so be prepared for that  their seafood platter was $50 for 1 lobster and couple other clam stuff that i would normally pay $35 ish elsewhere 
many hot pot place in flushing after this one when i been  no more another place again  one of the best hot pot  even in new york  by the way  you can see owner guy dance some time  what are you waiting for?
first off  xiao dong bei chinese cuisine moved to the new address properly listed above on yelp  and it changed its name to 'private kitchen ' the restaurant is spacious and good for a relaxing meal  the service is friendly and helpful  what really shines is the food which has exceptional flavor  with each dish having a wonderfully unique character  the food is fresh  properly cooked and not especially oily  three necessary components to most good chinese food  we had the dry shredded tofu skin mixed with scallion oil which had a superbly subtle taste and was very satisfying; the sauteed lamb with scallion had excellent flavor and a great simple sauce but the meat was tough; and finally the tree mushroom salad which seem to be crispy fried tea tree mushroom (agrocybe aegerita)  茶树菇 (cha shu gu) with szechuan pepper  celery and chilis  which was special and delicious  there are a number of excellent chinese restaurants in queens  but few with this kind of top notch unique cooking  check it out   
food is not good  the wait from the kitchen was long and overpriced relative to the quality  we ordered the corn and green peas with sugar which was mostly flavorless (tasted like someone poured a bag of sugar over some frozen vegetables  i can do that myself!) shrimp was not deheaded or even deshelled  the chicken tasted like it came from a can of purina dog chow (that was honestly gross  i don't know how they can serve this)  the boiled fish was incredibly plain and the broth was not spicy even a little although the menu said it was  the sugar potatoes dessert is exactly that  sugar on potatoes  the rice balls were ok  but they probably bought a premade one from a store (that's the only way) the bill for five people came almost to $120  that's way too much for the low quality food we were served  if you like spending allot of money on lousy food  come to this place!
fake as chinese restaurant! high rating for shit! if i could i would give it a negative 5 rating  not even a "0 " we are traveling from the west coast hoping to enjoy some delicious food  obviously our experience here was uncalled for  was told the wait was 30mins  waited for almost an hour to only have 2 groups who came much much later to be seated before us  when asked the hostess ignored me granted that my party was the only one that didn't speak chinese  we were ignored for the sake of them being racists (and yes i'm asian too  not their kind)  don't eat here  i'm sure there are plenty of great restaurants in the area  we surely walked out and found ourselves in a different restaurant around the corner that appreciated our business and treated us well with great food 
their "dry stir fry mushrooms" were delicious and has so many flavors of spices in it  a little bit on he salty side but perfect with rice   the portion for each dish is generous and you can tell they choose quality & fresh ingredients 
as a mainland chinese from northeastern area  i would give a thumb up to this place  very tasty & authentic northeastern chinese cuisine  which makes me feel like i am back to my hometown in a second  the only downside about this place is they offer a huge menu including different types of chinese cuisine  that means if you are non  northeasterner chinese you may have a high risk to order wrong dishes  which may turn to a truly nightmare  i highly recommend their sweet & sour crispy pork (锅包肉)  stir fried pork liver & laba garlic (腊八蒜肝尖)  these two are signature northeastern food and they did a pretty amazing job  i definitely will be back trying other dishes in the near future 
servers were really nice  though the front desk lady was a little bit mean and never pick up the phone when we tried to call to see the waiting time without reservation  their food was decent and in huge amount  where is specially ordered the dishes from northern china because we thought those were what this restaurant is famous for  but surprisingly they also have some szechuan dish options  in all  i like how their waiting time is not crazy  their price and quantity and the food was not bad at all  it's also good to try some food from nothing china which i've never really tried before  might go there again to try something more 
came here for friend's birthday  foods were not worst but below ok  the cold noodles came only with less than 10 pieces of noodles and lots of cucumber and carrot  the seafoods were not fresh at all  our bill came around $150 and they charged $1 for white rice  we only ordered one bowl of white rice  really??? so lame 
the kitchen staff here know what they are doing  the dining space is clean  the prices are very good by nyc standards these days  i cannot ask for more 
great service   great good  spacious dinning area  we enjoy coming here with friends and family  there are several dishes that i would like to recommend are lapi and song shy yu 
came here with my friends for dinner  as a northerner myself  i felt like i was eating at a good restaurant back in my hometown  unlike a lot of northern chinese places in flushing  xiao dong bei is very clean with great decor and service  the most important thing of course is the food  and i'd say it's very authentic  portion is good and price is reasonable  the menu features mostly northern cuisine with some sichuan dishes  it's the type of restaurant that both chinese northerners and southerners would like we ordered the mushroom and chicken stew(小鸡炖蘑菇)  one of the most traditional northern dishes  taste is spot on  i also highly recommend the pork jelly dish (i think it's called 水晶猪肘)  the texture and taste are both top notch  and don't forget to dip it into the garlic soy sauce  we also like the other dishes such as the fried little yellow fish and the string bean  potato  corn and pork chop stew  i enjoyed the dinner so much that i think i'd like to give the restaurant some recommendations as a true northerner  my friend who's also a northerner agrees with me 1  the strong bean potato corn and pork chop stew (猪肉焖油豆角土豆) is a little bit too sweet  we think it'll be better if the taste is more toward salty and savory 2  the fried little yellow fish (炸小黄鱼) comes with salt and msg  the fish tastes awesome but i wish it comes with pepper salt 3  the branding    it took me a while to find this place on yelp  i still don't know if its english name is xiao dong bei or private kitchen  i think it might be good for the business if the branding is consistent online and offline i'm glad to see this place garnered 4 5 stars on yelp so far  i'll definitely come back often and bring more friends 
food wasn't bad but wasn't amazing either  wouldn't really recommend it to anyone  we went in on christmas eve  to beat the crowd we came in pretty early  before we could finish our dinner the servers were very impatient and rude  we almost got kicked out just because other customers were waiting for a table  well  that's why you need to come earlier   it's not like i am gonna miss this place  not the food nor the service 
the taste is so good and the price is reasonable  the only thing is you may order too much since the quantity of most dishes are larger than usually  highly recommend!
everything we ordered was delicious!  we also had a kind of flower tea very refreshing 
we were there tonight  it's nothing special  in fact  more than half the dishes are not even from ne china  the taste and style are just average  service was generally good but their super long dinning area makes it hard for waiters to reach everyone immediately  i'm quite disappointed as i was expecting some uniquely ne of china 
very authentic sichuan cuisine with big portions and a reasonable price  the staff is considerably friendly and patient  we went on a weekend late at night when they were about to close  although the restaurant was pretty much empty  they were still willing to serve us  their menu was quite extensive with traditional sichuan food  as well as typical chinese dishes  we tried the baby ribs with peanuts and peppers  a dish recommended by the waiter  the ribs were not how we imagined it to be  as they were sliced as thin as paper  there was definitely a lot of preparation work behind making this dish! i like how they stirred fried the meat rather than deep fried the ribs  the peanuts were an alleviating complement with the spiced up meat on the more traditional side  we also ordered the braised beef dish  having tried just about every sichuan restaurant in manhattan and in the works in queens  xiao dong bei serves one of the biggest pots of braised beef  with the addition of black fungus and a variant of other different veggies  they sure filled the bowl with an abundance of protein and carbs  drowned in sichuan oil  the beef was super tender and the veggies were soaked with flavor  the dish definitely wasn't the spiciest we've had  but it was still delicious  rice isn't complimentary  so be sure to order a few as chasers with these yummy sichuan plates 
i came here recently due to the high yelp rating   we come to flushing regularly and i am always seeking for good chinese restaurants here   i've never heard of xiao dong bei (translated to "little northeast"  as in northeastern chinese cuisine) before  but was eager to try it as my grandparents are from northern china  and "dong bei" cuisine always reminds me of my childhood visits with my grandparents   anyway  maybe that was an unfairly high expectation of this place  but i was a bit disappointed by the food here   perhaps i didn't order the "right" food  i thought the four dishes we ordered were just average we tried ants on a tree   this was my favorite dish  it's vermicelli noodles with shredded pork   i thought the sauce was really delicious with just the right amount of spiciness   this is a pretty easy dish to execute  but some places tend to make it too oily  it is done pretty well here sauteed crispy pork   the server recommended this dish   i thought it was just ok   the pork was crispy  but not very flavorful inside   also  you need to eat this dish as fast as possible   as soon as the meat cools down a bit  the meat became very tough and starchycrispy fish with chili pepper   i wanted to order the whole fish  but per the waiter  the market price for a whole fish was $55  which i thought was ridiculous   most places charge approximately 20 25 for a whole fish   i am always annoy when i see "m p" on menus as i feel like the restaurant can just charge whatever they want   i opted for fish fillets instead  which was not bad   i like the crispiness of the fish  although the fish could've used more flavor notes other than spicy   i thought the chef went a little heavy with the sichuan peppercorns in the dish  but if you a big fan of spicy food  it would probably be a plus stir fried eggplant with basil   an average dish   i thought it was a tad too oily  but other than that  not a very memorable dish overall  i thought this place was over priced  the food was so so with hits and misses across the board   given the plethora of good chinese restaurants in flushing  i don't think i will visit again 
very solid northeast china cuisine from this relatively new house on 37th street  flushing  a modestly sized floor with enough room for several large tables  or many more smaller ones  the space feels bright even on a rainy night in november   the staff is accommodating and easily chats with the customers when they have a spare moment   they were all bilingual and quickly made me comfortable  i ordered eggplant and peppers in soy bean sauce and shredded pork in sweet bean sauce   more than enough for 3 people   the chinese eggplant was tender with a mild sweetness that countered the heat from the hot green peppers   the soy bean sauce added a pleasant and mildly salty undertone that went well in combination   the shredded pork was cooked to complete softness  while the sweet bean sauce lightly supplemented the flavor in a slightly sour direction   again  they worked well together  xiao dong bei is a nice out of the way joint where a quiet meal can be treasured without the crowds and hype that come with the fame and long waits of the more well known places in town  definitely a keeper  at least until it is discovered and becomes impossible to walk into and get a table without a rez 
we were here for dinner on a tuesday evening  the place was busy but we were seated immediately  it's a small restaurant  only minutes from the subway station  this restaurant serve northern style chinese food  the menu is great! lots of pictures! this is great for the people who is not familiar with the kind of food they are serving  we ordered the crispy fish filet with hot pepper & the pork with spicy garlic sauce  the crispy fish filet has cumin  which is great! we love it! they also put a lot of sliced onion which is also great! one of us really love onion! the crispy fish filet isn't as crispy but you can tell that it's a fish filet  not just some thin filet with lots of breading  the pork with garlic sauce were delicious but extremely greasy  it's shredded pork swimming in chili oil  it is definitely not something we would eat pretty often  overall  the food here is delicious  it's definitely worth stopping by  if you happen to be staying at the comfort inn on 37th ave  this restaurant is pretty much almost next to it  the portion is definitely generous  we spent about $31 here for dinner & there was so much food for the price we paid  we were so stuffed  one minor flaw about this place is that the food can take a little long to come out  the wait wasn't ridiculously long but it's just longer than most chinese restaurant 
i came here for lunch and had a salt baked pork chop with pepper (more canonically known as salt and pepper pork chop)  the pork chops were lightly breaded and bone in (though there weren't many bones)  the amount of seasoning used was just right  and the meat was quite fresh  the portion was large enough to save some for dinner 
i was so hyped up by all of the 5 star reviews  i guess i expected too much  and was just a little disappointed  my daughter was sad to hear that she couldn't get general tsao's chicken there  but somewhat enjoyed the pork in sweet & sour sauce (crispy)  unfortunately  it seems like the waiter forgot to order it  as our dishes came out one or two at a time  and finally my wife's yummy eggplant and green spicy peppers dish  when we realized the sweet sour pork never arrived  my daughter started getting ticked off  she was starving  and we only went for chinese in the first place cuz she wanted that dang general tsao's chicken  we checked w the waiter  he checked in the kitchen  came back with his index finger pointing up  and said  "one minute  just a one minute  ok?" around 5   10 min later  it came out extremely hot  ok  absolutely no one is perfect  there weren't any other mistakes  and there were 2 servers helping us  their english wasn't that easy to understand  but they understood us pretty well  and seemed genuinely interested in our experience there  given that we were a white family in an almost entirely chinese restaurant  i was happy with the service we received  (of course  being white in a chinese restaurant should have nothing to do with our experience  but the fact that it is real  i think it's something that cannot be denied )bathroom was clean  dishes were clean  i hate the thick plastic chop sticks they give you there  but it's way better than eating noodles with your hands  my noodle  pork & mushroom dish was ok  and noodles were somewhat chewy  but yummy; however  i found the amount of pork & mushrooms in it to be skimpy  the overall portion size of the dishes was quite large  we took home a lot of food  and spent $50 (before tip) for the 3 of us  my wife absolutely loved her eggplant dish  and sautéed stringbeans i might return  but my wife found the menu to be too bizarre in many respects (and that's one reason i appreciate the place)  where else can you be served a dish of duck heads  or fish head soup?
炒鸡好吃！i come from northern china and this place is very authentic  highly recommend stewed chicken with mushroom(小鸡炖蘑菇)  braised pork with vermicelli(酸菜炖粉丝)  fried pork in scoop(锅包肉)the chef is quite good at sichuan food too 
food  3 5 5 0service  2 0 5 0value  3 5 5 0decor  2 0 5 0overall  3 0 5 0the menu is a mix of northeastern china and szechuan   i can't opine on the latter  and i also can't opine on the value oriented lunch take out offerings   i am shocked how high the current ratings are   not to be a downer  but i don't see how an objective group of people could seriously give this place that many fives   the food is indeed northeastern  but the quality was very much mediocre   in one of the dishes  the potato was flat out undercooked   the service was poor with a lot of chatting amongst the younger wait staff when they weren't busy dealing with customers   poor service is something that could be a function of an off day in a poorly controlled chinese restaurant setting  and certainly you can get around it if the food's worth going back for  but that's just not the case   not going back   just so you know  i was tempted to give 1 or 2 stars to average the rating down  but that wouldn't be right 
on a hot summer night in manhattan we ventured on the #7 train to flushing queens (nyc's other china town) on a mission for greatchinese food   mission accomplished !!xiao dong bai  offers a varied menu of authentic delicacies prepared in a light and clean manner  there is nothing here that is swimming in globs of chili oil and fat like most chinese restaurants these days  everything coming out of xiao dong bai's wok is stir fried to crispycrackly goodness now for the particulars the cold dishes of spicy tofu noodles and wood ear fungus salad were exceptional  the noodles were quite firm "al dente" if you will and lightly coated in a delicious asian vinaigrette that packed a hot but reasonable punch the salad was pungent light and slippery  a perfect way to begin on this hot humid night the next dish to arrive was a whole shrimp fried withdry red chili peppers  they were crispy crunchy and can to be eaten whole in the shell especially good if you need to build up your calcium reserves  after this came a wonderful stir fry of eggplant potato and green onions  it was off the chain yum and we finished every morsel  finally skinless chicken thighs   bone in over chinese cabbage in an aromatic sauce  the sauce was a little too powerful for our tastes but the chicken was perfectly stir fried with very little grease the staff are extremely friendly and are happy to explain the extensive menu and to guide you as many of the offerings here are not commonly found in most americanized chinese restaurants  the menu featured lots of pictures of the food and for me this is usually a turn off since the menu  is extraordinary and the offerings notwidely known to most non chinese diners we can let this one slide  btw it's a few blocks from the main street and roosevelt avenue intersection but  it's well worth the hike 
this restaurant reminds me why i love yelp   great food at a place i would have easily overlooked   the stewed oxtail was incredible  their noodles were great and i enjoyed the black fungus with pork   i will go back!
ordered the spicy lamb with chili and was totally wowed by the combination of chili  onions  cliantro and the magic ingredient  cumin  could quibble about the small size of the lamb pieces  but won't since there was a fair amount of meat overall  not usually a fan of peanuts or carrot  but was taken by the complementary appetizer of marinated peanuts  carrots and celery  nice staff too!will definitely be going back to try more on my second visit i ordered the oxtail with corn  the segments of corn on the cob were amazingly sweet  the mushrooms succulent  and the bamboo shoots and baby bok choy were crispy  that said  the meat on the bone  while tender  was a bit sparse and didn't have that marrow richness that oxtail can have  still  the mandala arrangement of the elements and the preparation had the feel of a high end restaurant third visit  baby chicken with mushroom   an good amount of small chunks of chicken on the bone  black mushrooms and sweet potato noodle comes in a slightly thickened wonderfully rich flavored soup  that said  the chicken had a disappointingly dry texture; guess "baby" means lacking in fat that makes meat moist  this comes in a small wok that they put over a heating flame  my advice  don't use the flame which will overcook the meat even more  based on these experiences  i'm wondering if meat isn't their forte  or is treated like a flavoring more than a primary ingredient  the strength of some aspect of every dish prevents me from reducing my rating  so far 
the spicy red pepper lamb was our favorite  if you like basil  the stir fried eggplant with basil was excellent  we came as a group of 6 and there was nothing we had that we did not love  would recommend this place any day 
good vegetarian options  try the fava broad bean dish  eggplant and peppers  and the tofu skin chili casserole cumin chili lamb is solid and so is their shredded pickled cabbage and pork  interesting was the fried tea leaves and peppers on top of salt pepper shrimp  closing things out was the deep fried egg white meringue desserts stuffed with red bean paste (rolled in large pink? grain sugar)  only second time seeing this dessert offered since a visit to toronto  clean interior  large clean bathroom  good three large tables  beer by the pitcher available 
definitely recommended this place! the most authentic northeastern chinese foods here
i really like the spicy fish there  as a chinese  they can cook really local northeast food from china  my husband and i go to this restaurant really frequently with our friends 
i loved this place  i ate in the restaurant and the staff was helpful with my food selections  i ordered a steamed orange pork with rice  it was really great and the atmosphere was very authentic  great dim sum!
unfamiliar food choices  and poor service   the braised spare ribs was all bone and no meat it impossible to eat   after serving our food the waiter did not return to the table until we had to get his attention for the check   will not visit again  
wonderful northeast chinese cuisine  it also has some sichuan style food  would come again and again and again 
okay! first of all  there are so many chinese restaurants in flushing! but i'm gona have to say this is the best one i've ever tried!!their foods are so good  better than i thought it would be! plus  it is very clean and the waiters are really passionate!! i highly recommend this place! it is soooo awesome!!
the food here taste so good  i love the yam cabbage pork bone soup and braised fish fillet 
this was a wonderful find   it's off the beaten track and i suspect it's known only to those who seek out excellent meals made with fresh ingredients in authentic ways   we had several dishes and they were all superb   we will definitely return!
good  authentic  food   chopped salads  carrot  celery and cabbage   at every table   better than typical fried noodles   braised roasted pork with vegetable roasted chili was flavorful  not too spicy  huge bowl of tomato  egg eye drop soup  large portions  nice staff   would return if come to area again  
this is epicurean wonderland of new delights  the food first of all is very spicy so bring your asbestos palate  we had a cold wood ear and super fresh vegetable salad  fried fish with cumin and chilis and a vegetable dish in black bean sauce  the oil content is very low in these dishes which is a break from all the soggy chinese meals we've eaten  the fried fish was in the lightest batter with the spices just drizzled on top  no sauce  and the black bean sauce was very thin  again not oily  and flavorful  service is pretty attentive and this is our new go to place in flushing 
visiting area for us open  found restaurant on yelp and went based on reviews  great food  friendly service  definitely recommend 
the food is really good! very authentic! large quantity and low price! will definitely come back!
this place has great northern chinese food  they can accomodate large parties and their lunch specials are a steal at $5 79  gets pretty jumping late night  always a good time 
my friend who's from northern part of china took me there  i had no clue what to order  everything that he ordered were amazing! i don't eat spicy but i heard they have very good spicy dishes too  i like non spicy foods only  they have interesting desserts too  it's fried taro and sweet potatoes with honey  dip it into cold water before you eat  outside is very crispy and inside is soft  soooo tasty! prices are very reasonable too  the servers and owner are very friendly
wow! this place is amazing! this is the best chinese food i ever tried in flushing  their food is so good and you must try the cold noodle  i can say that is the best cold noodle that you can have  if you are aiming for lunch or dinner with friends and family  must come to this place  also the waiters are so nice and serve with passion  must must must!!!! goooooooo!!!!
the best jelly fish (海蜇皮）and fermented rice soup （酒酿圆子）ever!   they gave us free soup dumplings and fermented rice soup   tips  their entrees are more expensive but appetizers and street food is more reasonable   next time i will focus on those  the service is super fast and attentive   i was pleasantly surprised by how efficient and attentive they were but yet we didn't feel rushed   they got it nailed down!!!!
i have a mean habit of not reviewing my go to spots  when one visit becomes two  then three  then 10    there's just simultaneously too much and not enough to say here's what i can say about shanghai you garden (which doesn't feel like enough  but is likely too much)   they make some of my favorite 小籠包 (soup dumplings) in the city  no  it's not consistent   some days the skin is thicker  some days the broth is blander  but they've been great a solid 60% of the time  which is all we can really hope for  flavorful filling  tender wrappers  dangerously hot and quivering with gelatin  for those of you who rate nan xiang (yelp com biz nan xiang x…) or joe's shanghai (yelp com biz joes shangh…) higher  go home and think about what you've done   if your table spends $10+ (easy)  you get a free basket of six soup dumplings   weekends  weekdays  any time! this is an amazing deal for their signature food  and has been in effect since they opened  you don't even have to ask  they just bring it  this means 2 people can eat a tasty meal for $15    total  insane   the cold appetizers should not be ignored  夫妻非片 (sliced beef and stomach in chili oil) is better elsewhere  but my favorite here is 雪菜毛豆豆乾 (edamame and snow vegetable with bean curd tossed in sesame oil)   the breakfast items are unfortunately not worth your time  the 油條 (fried dough stick)  sweet soy milk  scallion pancake   none are the best they can be  the scallion pancake with sliced beef (牛肉捲餅) was plain bad  with dense  greasy bread and practically no beef  some of their noodle soups  namely the curry beef vermicelli soup  have been a waste of stomach space as well this little restaurant is busy  and only getting busier  i used to arrive at 11am on a weekend and not have to wait  now  no matter the time  weekend waits stretch at least 20 30 minutes  on the plus side  they have a system all worked out to accurately guess waittimes and shuttle people into tables in an orderly fashion  make sure your entire party is present  or you will not be seated  once seated  the staff are polite and efficient but don't rush you  shanghai you garden is not perfect  and is rarely mindblowing  it is  however  pretty reliable and rarely disappoints  i would tolerate a half hour wait to eat here again   and that's saying a lot 
i go there a lot    like over 20 times  whenever i come alone or with a friend or two  we always order simple dishes  scallion oil noodle  scallion pancake  veggie dumplings and once u order more than $10  soup dumplings are always on the house  how nice!whenever we come in a big group  we order big dishes  like pork stew  fried fish  fish head soup  all delicious  )come early and always expect the wait   
good food  busy as hell  pricing is strange and the force free stuff upon you  portions are sorta small  maybe that is why we got the crab and pork dumplings  snow peas and garlic  rice cakes with pork  and soy sauce duck  they forced upon us pork dumplings    and they came first of course the flavors were good overall  the duck was a lot of fat  but very tasty meat    for 7 bucks  a good choice  the peas and garlic were 16 bucks  no really  16  everything else was priced as we expected this place has a system  you wait 20 minutes or so  but review the menu and order while you wait once you sit  the food just appears out of nowhere  it's a good system good place overall 
my favorite restaurant in flushing! come early  like before 11 30am to avoid the long wait  came here countless times  dim sum is better than main courses  i think  authentic shanghainese cuisine  soybean products are my favorite  any noodle  rice  sticky rice are awesome too  orders above $10 also come with half dozen xiao long bao for free  great deal  thumb up! you can also get take out for cheaper price at the store across the street  it's a small food court called 88 #%€£    (i forget the exact name)
absolutely my favorite shanghainese restaurant by far!!! i've been here a handful of times now and i've never had a bad experience  a lot of reviews say that there is a long wait here  but it all depends on the time of the day you go i guess since i've only had to wait once and it was only a 15 minute wait  the restaurant opens at 8am and closes at 11pm daily note that this is a cash only restaurant as well first of all  i have to say something about their menu  it's great  they offer a picture of every item on the menu  which also makes everything on it seem extremely appetizing and appealing to the eye  the food is very inexpensive  you can get a whole meal for less than $10 a person  not to mention  they offer a complimentary order of soup dumplings when you spend over $10 or with a yelp check in  the dishes are large in portion in my opinion  i can never finish my food whenever i come here  some of my favorites here are the sweet soy bean curd ($1 50)  the portion is huge  the ratio of the honey sugar and bean curd is perfect  i always order this when i come for breakfast lunch cause it's so worth it!!scallion pancake with sliced beef ($4 95)  the portion is also huge for $5  the scallion pancake is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside  it comes with thin slices of beef on the inside with a sauce (i think it's hoisin sauce) and scallion  it's perfect to be shared and a great appetizer  cold shanghai special chicken ($6 95)  this is a cold appetizer  i believe it's a quarter of a chicken and it comes with a side of a sweet soy sauce  i usually order the hainese chicken when i go out to eat malaysian and that dish is normally warm  the chicken is tender and the sauce that comes with it really compliments it  watercress dumplings ($3 95)  i love watercress dumplings when i go get dimsum so i gave it a shot on one of my visits to shanghai you garden  you would've thought that for $4  you are getting a regular dimsum portion of dumplings  but i kid you not  these dumplings are on steroids  the skin of the dumplings are chewy and the dumpling itself is packed with watercress and shrimp  bursting with flavor  the atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice  the interior decor is very authentic and chinese  the service is extremely quick  the one time i had to wait  the waitress took my order while i was in line and within 5 minutes i got seated  my food came out  this is now my goto shanghainese restaurant!
free xlb and dessert! i didn't even know this deal was going on when i first came here some few months ago with my boyfriend  we ordered an array of dishes along with and order of xlb  and the waiter asked me to clarify whether or not i wanted one or two orders of xlbs  cause one was free! what a sweet surprise that cut our bill to just $20 (with a ton of food we ended up doggy bagging)! everything was delicious and as expected  and it came pretty darn close to nan xiang (my absolute favorite shanghainese restaurant) just a few blocks away i recently just came back with my sister  for the free xlb deal  we ordered scallion pancakes  shanghai shiu mai  shanghai fried udon  and an order of xlb  this time  though  i feel like the quality of food was lower  the dishes were a lot more oily than the first time i went and the portions  at least for the udon  were smaller  they also brought over two orders of xlb  though i expected just one free order  our waiter this time didn't clarify whether or not i wanted two which he should have   i mean how can two tiny little girls finish that much food?? kinda disappointed in that  but i can also see how it was my fault for not being the one to clarify  overall  great shanghainese restaurant  it's always packed so don't be surprised if you have to wait  and awesome place to check out for a budget meal!
are you looking for a cheap dinner with good portions?? then you are in for a real treat! tucked away in main street flushing is this little restaurant  it gets extremely crowded if you go later than 7 because come on   check in and you get a free order of steamed xiao long bao?!! what is this socery!! the restaurant is narrow and long so there isn't a lot of space in between the tables so don't be afraid to get intimate  the prices on the menu are also too good to beat!tip  order the xiao long bao once you sit because you never know how many people ordered and how long it will take  food ordered 1) regular and crab meat xiao long bao   i usually don't eat crab meat but surprisingly this place cooks the broth and meat really wellbut i can't really compare to kung fu xiao long bao because the skin is a lot tougher and thicker  2) shanghai pan fried noodles   you can skip this   the entree came out cold and dry3) noodles with beef and peppers   this dish had great portions and was really good compared to the shanghai pan fried noodles  4) big soup dumpling   it was so small and disappointing    you can really skip this i wouldn't rave about this place but if you are looking for a quick fix in flushing and trying to ball on a budget  this is the place for you  because everything my friend and i ordered was under $30!
bf and i was circling around flushing for about 30mins looking for street lot parking   we were going to give up and leave when we spotted someone pull out of a spot   i was so glad that we didn't leave because shanghai you garden xiao long bao was some of the best that we had   well worth the wait we got there around 2 30pm for a late lunch and the restaurant was still packed with a line out the door; we waited 15mins   the waiter gave us a menu and took our order as we were waiting what we ordered hot soy milk $1 50   it's been a while since i've gone to a shanghainese restaurant and i was so surprised when the waiter brought over a large bowl of soy milk   for a second i thought they had given us someone else's soup order   the soy milk was fresh and slightly sweeten scallion pancake with beef $4 95   the pancake was doughier and sweeter than i was used too   the best part was that it wasn't overly fried and saturated in oil  there wasn't much scallion on the pancake  it was ok  not bad   decent portion pork xiao long bao $5 75    soo good!  the xlb was much plumper and had more soup than the ones i've had from other restaurants   we burned our tongues slurping the soup  but continued eating anyway  )crab xiao long bao $6 75   we're getting 2 orders of this next time! decent amount of crab pork filling ratio and didn't have a strong fishy flavor  i can't wait to dine here again and to try some of the other dishes 
great food and service and decent prices but they only take cash  quite a few different options to choose from and nice turnip cakes! good soup dumpling and nice scallion pancake with and without beef  good soy milk too  you can also require to less it less sweetened  a few spots but always crowded but usually not too long of a wait  opens from 8am to 11pm everyday so it's great! pretty convenient with a couple different bus stops and 7 train at walking distance  love the place and will definitely be going back and highly recommend! promise you will not be disappointed  in fact  you will regret for not checking it out!
the place is popular and line is quite long  i came early to try their food and see what the rave is about   the staff is overwhelmed but attentive to a certain point  since i'm not familiar with their menu  waiter explained the dishes that were unfamiliar  delicious to the last bite    food quality is 5 star but service can definitely improve by adding more staff  great experience overall 
had me at 1 free order of pork dumplings when you check in! food was amazing! we came pretty late  they were closing in about 45 minutes   didn't feel rushed at all  food was very very good  i will be suggesting this place to friends and family
really cheap and authentic shanghainese food here! esp since you get free xlb pork soup dumplings if you order more than $10 worth of food  we came here on a saturday afternoon and waited 20 25mins for 3 ppl  also cash only! beware to not order too much because the food is really filling and each order of bao dumpling has at least 6+ pieces  i would say my favorite dishes would have to be the red bean puff pastry (they also have turnip cake filling) and the pan fried pork buns  they were our spontaneous orders and turned out to be surprisingly really good 
saw mike chen here! whoa anyways i wasn't going to review this place but something happened that made me have to say something my friend wanted hot pepper sauce  and asked the waiter  he said ok  then came back and gave us black pepper in a shaker  my friend said  no we want hot pepper  and the guy said "that's all we have!" and walked away before we could respond  the fuck!? super rude  it was a tall guy with swept back short hair and glasses  hey  screw you dude  we don't need your shit attitude could've been a 4 star  but his bad attitude ruined it for me  hope the manager reads this and tells him to shape up    rude af 
first time at this restaurant and it definitely won't be my last! came here for dinner on a saturday night around 8pm and it was packed  we waited around 20 25 minutes before we got seated which wasn't too bad of a wait  while we waited  we got a chance to look over the menu and put in our order so that by the time we sat down our food was ready my friend and i ordered the steamed crab meat pork buns  steam pork buns  scallion pancake with sliced beef  pan fried noodles with beef and the soup filled bun  and get this    they offer a complimentary order of the soup dumplings when you spend over $10!! what a steal!! sadly by the time we were seated they were sold out of the soup filled buns (i will be back for you!!)  so here's the breakdown of the food the scallion pancake with sliced beef was delicious! the pancake was crispy on the outside and paired with the sauce and the thin slice of beef was a great combo! this would be a great option if you're looking for an appetizer  the pan fried noodles with beef was a bit too oily for my preference  but nonetheless it was still good lastly  both orders of the soup dumplings really hit the spot! by the time we were finished with this we have fallen into a massive food coma  my overall experience here was positive  the service was quick and the overall ambiance was nice  can't wait to go back to try out other items on the menu!
went here for a quick dinner before a concert   friends were in the mood for xiao long bao (soup dumplings)    not a very big place  so if you have a big party  best to make reservations  we had a party of 5 for dinner and ordered a couple of crab and pork soup dumplings  noodle dishes  scallion pancake and dessert   dishes are not too big so if you are hungry  make sure you order a couple of dishes   busy during the prime time dinner hour  so best to order fast as it may take time for the food to come out esp the dumplings  reasonable cheap eats for dinner in flushing 
this place is the only place that makes the large soup dumpling for an affordable price $3! where can you find that others than this place?!!! the skin of the soup dumpling is thicker than the one i had before but still good for the price  they give free pork soup dumpling when you buy up to $10 stuff (no need to check in)  the beef pancake was so good (the sauce they put was tasty)
so nostalgic of shanghai  named after yuyuan garden  this shanghainese restaurant had so many of my favorite dishes from the motherland  i wish i had the stomach to eat everything  there's also a current promo going on where you can get a free tier of pork xiao long bao soup dumplings for free with $10 dine in purchase  you don't even have to check in  they will just bring it out with your meal  we also got a big bowl of 酒釀 glutinous rice dessert soup at the end  what a bonus! the staff was efficient but like any other chinese restaurant  don't expect them to be super friendly and catering to your needs  the food  however  is fantastic  here's some things i ordered 烤麸 kao fu bean gluten   one of my all time favorite cold appetizer dishes  it is slightly sweet and juicy  it has wheat gluten cubes  shiitake mushrooms  black fungus  bamboo shoots and this yellow flower veggie that is wonderful  you garden makes it pretty good  legit shanghainese style 素雅 su ya   different than how it usually comes as layers of tofu skin  this restaurant makes it more like a veggie patty  my friend also got veggie dumplings and they looked handmade  not frozen 小笼包 soup dumplings   we got the crab and were given the free pork ones  the crab meat ones were delicious  thin layer of skin with a hearty portion of pork and crab inside  one bite and a big mouthful of soup comes out  they mix tiny pieces of ginger into the filling to make it less fishy  which is my only complaint cause i hate ginger  other than that  it was great  stir fry snow pea tips   not a very big portion and a little heavy on the oil but the veggies were very tender and clean 猪脚黄豆汤 pig feet yellow bean soup   healthy and good for you  pig's feet is full of collagen  good for your skin  this is a rich flavored soup and i love the soft yellow beans this place is definitely giving joe shanghai and nan xiang xiao long a run for their money  good competitor 
a nice spot to eat out with friends be aware that you will not be seated until your full party has arrived! in the waiting area  you can watch the chefs make the xlbs and there are many choices of delicious cold appetizers out front as well  so look around and choose as you're waiting!my 2 friends and i ordered 2 orders of steamed pork buns  any orders over $10 comes with one free order of steamed pork buns  so we got one per person  additionally  we got salty congee  beef pan fried noodles  and scallion pancakes  the scallion pancakes were pretty good  chewy on the inside and very crispy on the outside  but not greasy at all  i was disappointed at the beef pan fried noodles  i very rarely order these when i go out because they're hard to make right and generally expensive  these were a bit salty and not crunchy at all  sadness! though the pork bun deal is good for the price of everything  i can't say i'd go back here for more   the flavor of the pork buns here aren't fantastic  there are more choices for xlb around this area  if you want quantity  come here  if you want flavor  go elsewhere  service isn't great here  but there's pretty nice decorations  free wi fi  and it's on a pokéstop  the grand total for 3 people was ~$10 each  it was not very busy here for a saturday morning 
came with a group of four and ordered the young chow fried rice  pork xlb (free with check in)  rice cakes with chopped vegetables  shrimp shumai  scallion pancakes  grandmas braised pork  pan fried pork buns  chinese dou miao leafy vegetable  this was too much food  although the lady at the front said we should've ordered more everything was good  came in decently sized portions  and was priced fairly  the grandmas pork was a little sweet in my opinion  this place had pretty good service compared to other chinese restaurants  worth a visit for quality chinese food  not sure if it's worth the trek to flushing though 
this place was packed  i didn't realize it was this popular until i showed up  there was a line out the door in the doorway and inside! they give you the menu while you wait and you can preorder so that you don't have to wait too long for the food and to be quite honest i'm sure it helps them with turn over as well  we order the soup dumplings of course since we wait all year to come back to ny for this wondrous taste  it skin was just right as well as the juice and the nicely packed meat  most of the time it doesn't break unless you don't know how to handle it  we also order the vegetarian dish which was fantastic  the udon noodles were super salty and saucy but it was delicious  less salt on the noodle dish would have been nice  seafood udon  chicken udon  and pork udon  there was also orders of fried rice which was tasty  the staff was friendly which is a nice change from service in flushing restaurants 
not everything was bad  but we were disappointed by the majority of items the best item by far was not the soup dumpling  but the savory moon cake   the soup dumplings were decent    the skin was acceptably thin  but the soup was too rich fatty for my liking   as an fyi  the filling is also a bit on the sweet side   the braised pork in brown sauce (紅燒肉) was also one of the better items   the shanghai noodles were standard    fine  but nothing special now  onto the really disappointing   the beef noodle soup had no depth to the flavor; the beef had almost no taste and was not that tender   shanghainese cuisine is supposed to be delicate and intricate  but many of the dishes were anything but that   the scallion pancake beef roll was so incredibly thick   i can't think of the last time i had such a fat scallion pancake   it was probably the size of 3 normal sized ones stacked together  so needless to say  it was not much of a wrap and was barely folded over   the fried bun with chives and egg was also ginormous   granted  the skin there was not overly thick  but it was a bit overfried and unnecessarily large   the malantou (veggies and tofu side salad) was really mushy and not fresh there are so many great chinese food options in flushing  so i'm bummed that we spent a rare trip to flushing here 
can't go wrong with free soup dumplings with a $10 dine in purchase  depending on the time of arrival you might have to wait from 20 35 minutes but they let you place your order with them in advance so once you sit down the order gets submitted to the kitchen automatically and it helps with the food coming out faster especially those delicious soup dumplings  the service is ok and only some of them speak and understand english  we always order the pork soup dumplings  fried rice  and pan fried udon noodles  the dishes look small but it's quit filling  if you want to get food for take out i suggest ordering on the phone in advance then coming to pick up as the place gets super crowded and there's no where to sit and wait for take out orders 
update 1 5 17 !!! exceptional quality  food  service & good value !!! do not miss this spot if you're visiting or stopping by flushing!!!shanghai you garden is now the spot my boyfriend and i will frequent for dinner  we ordered pan fried dumplings for dinner and we were presented with a dish that came with sesame seeds(unexpectedly  since on the picture there were none  my boyfriend absolutely dislikes sesame seeds)  we asked the waiter if he could scrape off the sesame seeds for us  which couldn't be done  the manager then came by and offered to take it back to the kitchen and arrange for a new set of pan fried dumplings to be made(thank you so much!)  the pan fried dumplings were a bit oily  but overall tasted great and had a nice crisp texture on the bottom  all in all  we had a great dining experience  and look forward to coming back here for dinner again   )  good bye  nan xiang xiao long bao on prince st    i never liked you anyways even tho you're zagat or whatever rated  the xiao long bao at shanghai you were fresh and delicious  crab meat & pork xiao long bao  rich broth light on palateregular pork xiao long bao  typical pork xiao long bao that is not soggy nor greasy  free with orders $10+scallion pancake w  sliced beef(my picky so approves!)  scallion pancake was steamy hot & crisp sliced beef had great flavor and hints of star anise this was really goodgrandma's red braised pork belly  this dish is overpriced  especially in regards to the portion size  freshly made from scratch comes with quail eggs the sauce was good  similar to teriyaki sauce but way better  pork belly had a good proportion of fat to meat(wasn't overly fatty)  the meat was not too soft  but chewable aside from the xiao long bao  i can't wait to come back here to try other items on the menu  it was a great flavorful experience  ^_^
cash only!on a thursday afternoon  there was a bit of a wait but not too long  they give you a menu while you wait which was pretty nice so i can think of what to order with my friend  they have a deal where if you spend more than $10  they give you a free order of xlb  food here is relatively cheap  my friend and i ordered a bunch of food and we couldn't finish so i ended up taking to go  we had the free xlb (yay!)  it is good  the dumpling layer was thin and the soup was good  i felt there was a lot more veggie than meat  but not complaining since it was free the scallion pancake was fluffy and good  it was very fried but the more fried  the better tasting! we also had the fried wontons  it was stuffed with a lot of meat and was very crispy  the shanghai shumai here is pretty good but i'd have to say i prefer the one from kung fu xlb  the sticky rice inside the shumai wasn't as flavorful as the one in kung fu  but the one here is definitely a bit bigger  the fried fish wrapped in seaweed was surprisingly good  i have never had it before and the taste was interesting  the fish is perfectly fried and there is a lot of meat inside  the seaweed isn't overly empowering but adds a different taste to the fish  overall  i would come back again  there was enough food for three and super duper reasonable price 
where do i start ?!? well  my fiancé and i have been coming here for some time now  we always seem to beat the traffic (long wait)    thank you god!! the turn over service here is 20mins   which means there's no talking while eating here   it's all just yummy!! soup dumplings are all hand made which you could observe soon as you enter the restaurant  also  they have complimentary soup dumpling (pork filling   with orders over $10 bucks)  tea and dessert  three good reasons to stop and try this place out  
we've dined in many places in flushing and i will have say this has been one of the best and most attentive service   we did go during slow time  3 pm on a wednesday  but there was still a nice crowd that you can tell the food was going to be good   i would hope the service is just as good during peak hours  the food was delicious  the prices are low enough that you can sample a little of everything  we order a lot that we were gifted a complimentary order of soup dumplings  looking at the place on the outside  it does not appear to be much  but the moment you walk in  you can see that it's charming and with the chefs busily making soup dumplings in the front of the restaurant   overall  the food was delicious  the service great  we will definitely come back 
key words  (1) ca$h only  (2) long wait (but some seating available inside while you wait)  (3) very cheap  (4) lightning fast service  (5) free xiaolong baos recommend  soy sauce duck (though we are pretty sure we got tofu instead)   even though it looks like it was drenched in soy sauce  it was not too salty and it was marinated well a narrow but quite clean chinese restaurant with a small dim sum selection   i prefer one of those carts places for dim sum  but this place still features steamy fresh dim sum to go along with a wide selection of authentic chinese food note that even though this place offers a check in offer for steamed buns  they give everyone for free as long as you order more than $10   though the line can get long  it moves quite fast because the service is really quick 
giant soup dumpling was a fun experience but oh so salty!!! actually a lot of shanghai food is on salty spectrum  came in day after christmas for lunch and they were packed  you take a number and you order food while waiting in line  cash only and they have a atm inside   as soon as you sit down the food you ordered will quickly arrive  decor is cute  a lot of chinese water color painting and such  nice wide booth  walls a bit dirty though  needs a good wipe down 
i came here for new years dinner and the restaurant wasn't crowded  we ordered 3 items  soup dumplings  pan fried soup dumplings  and sticky rice dumplings  the soup dumplings were good  the sticky rice dumplings were interesting but literally stuffed with sticky rice inside and on the top; i wish there was a meat inside instead  the pan fried dumplings were good  but soaked in too much oil the total came out to be only $16!cash only pro tip  check in on yelp and receive a free order of steamed pork dumplings!
"you lost that dumplin' feelin'whoa  that dumplin' feelin'you lost that dumplin' feelin'now it's gone  gone  gone  wohohoh"all you've gotta do is stop on by and order up some freaking awesome dumplings from here  and that dumplin' feelin' will be fillin' ya up!with a large dining room  fast service  and a nice range of choices that dont come in a menu the size of a holy text is a nice change from some dumpling places  the lack of personal service and the fact that one waitress took my plate that had my fresh spring roll that she saw me put down after just one bite was a bit annoying  come on you saw me put the spring roll down after just one bite and snatched up the plate and turned away in like 1 second  waited for my actual waitress to ask if everything was ok so i could say something  but my food was dropped off briskly as if i were a leper ya get 4 stars because the dumplings were good  the prices are great  service was fast  if there was any kind of personal service it would get 5  why you just take my spring roll? =(4 stars 
my wife and i had a pretty solid lunch experience here   we got a lot of food for 2 people fried bun with chives and egg   we get this all over flushing and i think theirs is one of the better ones   the bun itself is quite good  4 5soy bean pig feet soup   the broth was hearty and the beans were good  can't go wrong with pig feet  4 5rice cake with shredded pork and preserved vegetables   the rice cake was slightly overcooked but the flavor was good  i was afraid the preserved veggies might make the dish too salty but it wasn't too bad  3 5 5spicy tendons   this is one my favorites dishes and i really like the way they flavored it   it wasn't just dipped in chili oil  tendons were sliced thinner than what i usually see and i think that helped to absorb more flavor  4 5salty bean curd soup   not as salty as some places (a good thing) and overall a pretty decent shout if you like tofu milk garnishes thrown in together  3 5 5xlb (free!)   hard not to like free food  the pork xlbs we got weren't as oily as some other popular xlb places which is a plus  3 5 5they score pretty high on my taste per dollar ratio given the cheap prices and the set up is comparatively nicer than most similar joints in then neighborhood  will definitely come back to try their shanghainese style noodles next time  cash only!
i should've left a review along time ago  we always have a wonderful meal here   every dish is  a delight  they always give a free basket of xiao long baos  but we always end up ordering 2more baskets   (haha my love for these are an excuse to ditch my diet from time to time) there is always a line out the door whenever we come the wait time can range anything from 30mins   1 5hrs however i discovered the trick to skipping the line    come dine during lunch time on a weekday but hey if you and up waiting for awhile the waiters actually give you a menu while you wait and take your order so when you finally sit down there's not a long wait time for your piping hot yummy food to arrive  everything from the steamed veggie dumplings   seaweed croaker fish  scallion pancake wrapped beef  yuge meatballs (lionhead)   beef lo mein and much more cooked to perfection  during dinner time they gave us free desserts after your meal (sweet glutinous rice balls w wine sauce and eggs) it's said to be very nutritionous and keeps you warm on these cold winter nights) anyways prices are very decent as well  my husband and i once took our out of town family members here and we ordered like a beast for a table of 10  we left here taking doggie bags and on top of that so full the button on my pants literally popped opened (nah jk it didn't  but you get the idea)  and the bill was just around 200$ plus tips
a bit baffled as to why people say this place is better than nan xiang  sure  it might be a bit cleaner  and the table gets a free order of soup dumplings  but the taste is not even close to nan xiangs soup dumplings  and the rice cakes here are pretty tasteless compared to other places in chinatown  the wait here is also pretty long because of the slower turnover rate compared to nan xiang  so i don't know why people say shanghai you is so much better  it's not  also a travesty is the jumbo soup dumpling  which is a far cry from the jumbo soup dumpling i've had in shanghai  the one here is literally all soup  but it's a weird vegetable soup thing which you slurp with a straw  it's super gimmicky without the flavor to back it  it's cute for a picture but honestly a waste of money as the soup tastes funky and the soggy skin isn't exactly something you want to eat their cold dishes are decent   i always get the hau fu at soup dumpling restaurants  we also tried their cold chicken which was pretty mediocre  but the price isn't bad  their spicy beef is decent also  but it's kinda hard to mess up these cold dishes  we also tried their pork "mooncakes" which is pretty much the dumpling meat inside a flaky pastry  it looks nothing  nor tastes like  a mooncake  it did not impress me at all  but my parents told me they reheated it the next day and it was delicious  the scallion pancake was pretty standard as well  their fried pork buns are pretty average as well   a little too much bread and not enough meat which seems to be a common trend nowadays  the soup dumplings were the biggest disappointment of all  as people said it was superior to nan xiang in flavor which is not the case at all  one of my friends told me the chef used to work at nan xiang but it tastes nothing like it! the rice cakes were flavorless as well overall the plating here is much nicer  and it's a cleaner feel overall  but i do not think it's worth the sacrifice in flavor  nan xiang is a little bit dingier  but the soup dumplings there are the best  we also got a complimentary dessert which was some sweet porridge with gluttonous rice  it was pretty good but there was a lot of alcohol in it 
after seeing long lines in front of you garden  i finally found the time to make a visit  you can easily get here by getting off at the main street station in flushing on the 7 subway line or by taking the lirr to flushing where the restaurant is literally across the street from the lirr exit staircase when we arrived  it was about 11 45 am on a sunday morning and already there was a small waiting line in front of the restaurant  there was a lady giving out numbers and told us that the wait was about 25 minutes  she also handed us a takeout menu  we actually got in after 15 minutes  what was interesting was that before we stepped inside  another worker took our order  i didn't expect this  but luckily i was already making up my mind what i was getting the restaurant is long and narrow and is nicely decorated with calligraphy and bright lighting  seating is dominated by many 2 to 4 seater tables  i didn't see any larger tables but perhaps my view was obstructed we ordered several dishes large soup dumplingpork soup dumplingcrab and pork soup dumpling tang baodeep fried yellow croaker with dried seaweedpork rice cakespan fried udon with beefsince this restaurant is known best for its xlb soup dumplings  it was a priority to try them  we were delighted to learn that the restaurant had a buy one get one free offer for their regular pork xlb  i felt that both orders of soup dumplings were very good  the skins were on the thicker side and not translucent  i never felt the skins would break as i picked them up with my chopsticks  the meat inside was dense and formed a finely formed meatball  the soup quality had flavor but i felt it was a bit on the neutral side and this was for both kinds of xlb  my partner and i thought it was a 7 5 on a scale of 1 to 10 we also ordered the giant "tang bao" or extra large soup dumpling  this is served in a dim sum steamer  the xlb is about 4 inches wide and is lined on the bottom with parchment paper  it's filled with a yellow ochre colored crab soup with a small crab and pork meatball  we felt that the soup tasted really watered down and didn't have any character or heft to it  the meat wasn't any better and the skin was very thick  i think to hold in all the soup  we felt that the tang bao was much better as a standard xlb soup dumpling  super size didn't do much for this dish as for the yellow croaker  we've had this dish at many other restaurants  however  i felt that there was a slight sourness to the dish  not sure if it was vinegar that they added  but it wasn't really to my taste  other restaurants would make this dish a little more to the salty side without the sour flavor as for the pork rice cakes  i really enjoyed this because it was combined with thin slices of mushroom and packed a punch of umami in the brown sauce the pan fried udon was also well done  it had "wok hei" (wok smoke flavor) and was seasoned right  not too salty or oily  the beef slices were really nice in the way that they were cut  it was pencil wide strips but cooked to the point where there was a nice browning and char on the meat  i really liked this compared with how other shanghainese restaurants make this dish you should note that this is a cash only restaurant all in all  this was an excellent  first time experience  i would definitely come here again because there so many dishes that stand out in their visually appealing menu  those tiny pictures really do sell the food!
one of the best place to eat lunch (shanghai food); food is delicious and extremely cheap  you'll know once you get here  i've been coming to eat lunch here for a while now 
i came here on a sunday early afternoon with a friend and they told us the wait would be 20 mins and we're like ok  turns out we waited almost an hour until we got our table  we ordered the scallion pancake with beef (crispy  delicious and not too saucy like other places)  crabmeat soup dumplings (it was alright  not too salty)  pork soup dumplings (free with $10 purchase which is alright too)  soup filled bun (big soup dumpling which was overrated and definitely dont eat the skin  and pan fried seafood noodles (delicious when hot but could use less msg) half hour later  they pretty much asked us if we got all our order  we said yes and bam gives us the check  food came on a timely manner only because we ordered it in advance while we were waiting "20 mins"  overall  this place is mainly for tourist and for those that never been to see what the craze is about  don't mind coming back here for the scallion pancake with beef and maybe try other foods but definitely not coming back for the soup dumplings 
good decor and design and the good food makes the restaurant better or above avaragei had crab and pork  and a soup dump beef scallion pancake  the food was delicious and hot especially the beef salcallion pancake is really beast very flavorful and taste the haven right there also the steamed vetetable dumpling are also very good2 friends and i was there for lunch and it was good to be in here with all those delisted food and dumplings and soups 
i came here for the second time last week this place is always superrrrrr busy! but even if you have to wait to be seated  it's not usually for too long  shanghai you garden is very affordable and is a great place to come with a group of friends if you want to eat a ton  but not break your wallet one order of soup dumplings is complimentary!! we ordered pan fried noodles with shredded pork and seafood pan fried udon noodles  they also serve breakfast all day  we also ordered shanghai egg roll  fried dough  and sweet soy bean curd i wouldn't say the food was incredibly delicious  but everything we got tasted good and was decent  the portions were family style so they were easy to share  all the food came out very quickly too!
found shanghai you garden on yelp and decided to give this spot a try  switching it up from my typical flushing go to  i wasn't quite sure what to expect  this place was definitely more on the authentic side  upon arrival  there was a short wait and was given a little beeper  what i found so interesting is that there's someone walking around taking each parties orders before they even sit  once called  you are seated at your table and your food arrives shortly after  kind of cool! have never seen a place do this before  very efficient  we ordered pork soup dumplings (you get an order for free when you check in on yelp!) & the shrimp dumplings  which were both delicious! the pork buns were just ok  really not that great  as i just got back from shanghai a few months ago  i'm holding these to quite a high standard  we also ordered beef udon noodles & sesame chicken  both pretty american dishes that really weren't that great  probably should've only stuck with dumplings at this spot 
very conveniently close to the flushing 7 train station  we went at 5pm  and luckily got seats for two quickly  around 6pm and after  the wait looked pretty long they had a buy two get one free soup dumpling deals  so of course we had to get it  for two people  we ordered three racks of soup dumplings  one beef pancake  vegetarian mock meat  wood ear mushroom and a stir fried udon noodles  boy  we were stuffed! the soup dumplings  were actually pretty good    thin skin  piping hot liquid and tender meat  the beef pancake is amazing  not too oily  but was still very crunchy (the beef was tender and delicious)  the side dishes of vegetarian mock meat and wood ear mushroom were tasty  the only thing that lacked was the udon noodles  it was oily and just wasn't that flavorful 
we care here after reading the reviews on yelp   we came on a thursday night around 7pm and there was a wait for seating   that is a good sign as we passed other restaurants and they were empty   the restaurant has a large selection of dishes to choose from   it was so hard to decided on what to order because everything looked good we ordered crab meat filled xiao long bao (steamed soup buns)jelly fish   beef pan fried noodles and a regular xiao long bao    when i tried to order the xiao long bao the waitress told us that we would get it for free if we plan to order more than $10 00 of food   that was is what i call great customer service  kudos to the waitress!all the dishes we ordered were fresh   the skin of the soup dumplings were thin and the soup filling was delicious    we even got free sweet soup with our meal   we're definitely coming back to this restaurant for more food!
we were here sunday for lunch and it was a lot~~~ of people  the wait was not too bad  you order first while waiting then 20 minutes you'll be seated  they're doing promotion of free steamed pork bun not sure what you need to do to get it though~ice soy milk  3 5 nothing specialsalt sticky rice roll  1 5 mushy fritters with mushy and lose sticky rice  the whole thing was fulling apart pork moon cake  3 5 the waiter had to reheat it because it was cold when he gave it to us and this was the first dish he brought us so kind of surprised that its cold   it wasn't too bad after he reheated it though there was lots of meat in it crab meat pork bun  5 5 my bf's favorite~ both this and the steamed pork buns are the gem of this place  the skin is very thin and lots lots of soup inside  i would definitely come back for this steamed meat pork bun  5 5 my personal favorite  i think this is better than the crab meat one but both are good  just get both~rice cake w  pork & preserved veggie  4 5 a bit on the oily side but pretty tastypork wanton in chili oil  4 5 there's peanut sauce inside   i didn't read the english description so i thought this would be a typical wanton in chili oil that i usually like   not a big fan of peanut sauce but my son love love love this dishrice cake w  salted egg  3 5 very thick oily skin with duck egg and dried shredded pork inside  i can make this at home   staff  5 5 very fast service  they are definitely busy but you can get their attention easily and get what you asked for within a minute or two this is going to be my go to place when i crave for steamed pork bun  there's so many other items on the menu i would want to try  definitely recommend it~
finally got to try this place! this place is located in one of the shady streets in flushing on 40th road  it's also mixed with a bunch of different establishments but it's the door to your left when you first walk in (don't go upstairs)  the inside is actually pretty nice  from the waiters dressed in the chinese uniforms to the decor  i really wanted to come here for the soup dumpling! we got quoted 15 minutes  waited less than that  the hostess will give you a ticket with a number and party size  wait inside!! as they will not come out to find you  the hostess even told us to just wait inside we ordered the rice cakes with preserved veggies & pork  crab meat and pork soup dumplings  fried bean gluten  one free rack of pork soup dumplings  and the soup dumpling  the 2 99 soup dumplings (only soup) has a crab flavor which is nice  it's also an amazing alternative to that $10 big soup dumpling in the city  if anything  this place is deff way more worth! everything was super delicious but these aren't the best soup dumplings i've had  i do think that nan xiang in flushing has better soup dumplings but you get a free rack of regular pork soup dumplings when you spend over $10 here which is pretty worth it in my opinion  this place also serves more shanghai dishes   you don't have to check in on yelp to get the free soup dumplings  just tell them and they'll give it to you  this place also has really good customer service which is surprising bc chinese restaurants usually suck in terms of service  this place is cash only! our total came up to about    $33 for two people including tip!there is also dessert at the end of your meal which tasted pretty good  it was semi sweet yet really healthy tasting  overall  love this place! would deff come back if i was craving some good shanghai food but if i was craving soup dumplings only  i would prob opt for nan xiang 
a very narrow  but nicely decorated restaurant specializing in the it never gets old xlb  the space is bright  with lovely chinese calligraphy folding panels used as ceiling decor  the gold wall decor and green velvet cushions were also nice touches  three of us came for dinner and had a bit of a wait  but the servers took our order during the wait  food arrived in no time once seated the pork soup dumplings were fine  nothing special  with decent pork filling  the pork crab mixture was more flavorful  but still not as good as joe's shanghai or even nxxlb  they were piping hot though  the scallion pancake beef rolls were well done  but some slices sinewy  the pan fried pork buns were soft and their bottoms crispy  but again the same pork mixture showed up  all unadventurous like  i did like our seafood crispy noodles dish  which was very saucy and generally a hard dish to mess up  the sweet soy drink also nice and warming on a cold night the freebies were a plus  including an extra order of pork soup dumplings and rice wine dessert soup with goji berries  business was booming  but it didn't feel like much of a find  more like another middle of the road option in the grand landscape of flushing dining 
an exceptional combination of great food  pricing  cleanliness  and time needed to get seated my friends and i visited 3 times over the course of 3 days when we visited flushing  the stand out dishes are their scallion pancakes with beef and hoisin sauce  grandma style braised pork  spicy noodles with beef and peppers  and their soy bean gluten (a savory tofu like dish)  the scallion pancakes are incredibly fluffy and currently my favorite in the nyc area  shanghai you also has a promotion where they give an order of xiao long bao (soup dumplings) if you order over $10  their xlb is pretty good  but if it wasn't for the promotion  i would probably skip it  they also make their own savory zhong zhi (sticky rice wrapped with banana leaves) and i ordered a few to freeze and take home  each time i steam one for lunch  i reminisce of their scallion pancakes  i can't wait to go back 
this is my favorite chinese dim sum restaurant in town  steamed dumpling (xiao long bao) is so juicy and fresh  staff are very friendly and introduced their hometown cuisine very clearly  i also tried toufu fa at this time  the flavor is salty with green onion  a kind of chinese mushroom and soy sauce  yummy 
all time favorite xlb spot in flushing! my friend showed me this place as few weeks ago and since then  i've been coming here  for dine in only  if you purchase a xlb order  they offer you a free one  amazing service and the best part was them offering complimentary dessert  i loved all their dishes!  xlb regular and crab   rice cakes with preserved cabbage and pork   scallion pancake with beef   shanghai shumai  wonton on chili oil
this was my first time visiting this restaurant  went during the weekend before 10am was worth it  if you order more than $10 you get a free xiao long bao  my advise go early to avoid the long wait time and bring someone who knows mandarin because they know little cantonese and english 
don't know how i walked right pass the long line of people! food was amazing   had the seafood noodles  shrimp dumplings  cold duck  the noodles were very perfectly crispy with sautéed veggies  the duck was tender  and the shrimp dumplings were steamed and set precisely  service was quick  waiters not friendly but that was overlooked as soon as we started eating  you know the place is good when you see natives eating there   and you're the only non native 
definitely one of my favorite shanghainese spots in the city  love how the restaurant is trendier and more comfortable than other places in flushing  but still equally as affordable and delicious! i stopped by on a saturday and waited for about 20 minutes before getting seated  we were encouraged to look over the menu and order while waiting (which i am a total fan of)  by the time we were seated  it took only minutes before our food arrived  my friend and i tried the extra large soup dumplings  mainly for the fun factor  they were average and i would recommend saving stomach space for more xiaolongbao instead  the xiaolongbao's (pork soup dumplings) were awesome and comparable to other popular spots in the area  what i absolutely loved was the seaweed battered fish  perfectly fried and not overwhelmingly oily  the shanghainese stir fried noodles and chicken soup were solid as well  verdict  this is the place for you to get delicious shanghainese food without needing to sacrifice comfort service 
short version  go here  eat good food  expect to wait  free order of soup dumplings! skip the giant soup dumpling unless you really need to insta it  long version  shanghai you garden has the same head chef (or owner?) of nan xiang so of course the soup dumplings will be great! really nice decor and the waiters are nicer here  expect a frenzy as you wait though; they'll ask you to order first so once you sit  the food arrives! pretty efficient  but makes me feel rushed  been here a few times and never had anything bad  wish their pan fried pork buns had a little bit more meat! that is all  go here  wait the wait  you won't be disappointed 
this was my first time eating soup dumplings   mmmm  they were delicious!  we came at a good time too  the line built up very fast   it's a small location  so i'd recommend not going at a typical prime meal time i preferred the pork soup dumplings to the seafood soup dumplings  but they were just a tid bit too salty  but still delicious none the less 
i have eaten at many of the nearby restaurants but until today i had not tried the food at shanghai you garden (i checked in once before but then realized that the line was too long and went elsewhere)  i came with my cousin who works one morning a week in flushing and often stops here afterwards when i arrived  the place was full but unlike on weekends  there was no line outside  the people who greeted us were friendly and promised us a table in about 5 minutes  and right on cue  we were seated 5 minutes later the servers were all very friendly  attentive and too polite to laugh at my awful command of their language!  we began with scallion pancakes    not on my current low carb diet  but because my cousin said they were the best she had ever had  i said i would try one   and ended up eating three   enough said next we inquired about stinky tofu which our server warned smelled awful but tasted great  right after he left we thought we smelled raw sewage or a baby that needed changing but it was a close by table that was also having stinky tofu   when ours arrived  luckily we trusted our server and ignored the smell  the dish itself  was flavorful with a nice spicy kick  while eating the tofu i noticed some of the servers watching us   it was at that point that i realized that we may have been one of the first "lao wai's" to take the stinky tofu plunge!as others have noted  you get a free order of xiao long bao (soup dumplings) when you have ordered $10 of more of food (even on weekends)  our soup dumplings were exceptionally juicy and flavorful  they reminded me of ones that i had had eateb when in shanghai and stood up in flavor to the ones served at nan xiang and joe's shanghai   the two most popular soup dumpling restaurants in flushing  our bill with tip was about $15 for two people   not a bad deal   unfortunately they do take credit cards   4 5 stars!
what is not to love about a delicious shanghai dumpling spot where you could go into food coma for $20  i am currently the "duke" of this place for good reason  the food is just sooo good and sooo cheap  free dumplings for $10 worth of food  get the pan fried noodles  couples beef and a few appetizers 
i'm ridiculously proud of being shanghainese  and you garden exemplifies everything i love about my culture  i came here with my family  all three generations  for an early dinner on a saturday night  and we were grateful for this place and its authenticity  shoutout to the entire waitstaff who spoke shanghainese  we felt so at home first off  this place gets packed  it's so busy  and they don't have a ton of space  but they'll get that food to you as quickly as possible so you're in and out within a 2 hour window  my aunt's been here a few times already  so we already knew what to order  but trust me when i say i doubt you'll get to dawdle over the menu   it's too busy for that we got an assortment of shanghainese staples and each was as authentic as the next  the xiaolongbaos are definitely real af here; get that and grandma's braised pork  those were hugely delicious cash only! the food is thankfully as cheap as it is yummy; nine people spent about $250   and we all ate decent portions  i can't wait to roll through again 
having tried both nan xiang and shanghai you garden now  i think the soup dumplings are definitely better at nan xiang (which is probably why they're giving them away for free here    just saying)  the other dishes were very good  but lacked authenticity in my opinion  the spicy beef and beef scallion pancakes were my favorite  i thought that the stir fried udon noodles were a little too oily and tasted like your typical takeout food  the sticky rice rolls were also definitely better at nan xiang too   the fried dough breadstick inside was a bit stale in the order we got and super hard to chew  however  shanghai you garden is definitely cleaner and has better food presentation than nan xiang  shanghai you garden would also probably be better for larger groups based on the table setup  still a solid place to grab brunch with decent prices!
this is the go to place for soup pork dumplings with or without crab meat   the skin is a bit thicker than the taiwanese style  but there is plenty of soup inside   the lines can be long  but it's worth waiting for the dumplings  scallion pancake wrapped beef sandwiches  and baked  shredded turnip cakes   if their sheng jian bao also had soup  i'd give them five stars service is fast and friendly   parking can be tough on the street  but there are nearby lots 
my parents love this restaurant  i'm pretty sure it's because of the free soup dumplings you get if you order $10 or more  not my favorite place for them  but they're pretty good  i actually prefer the regular pork soup dumplings to the crab and pork ones  which normally isn't the case the rest of the food is okay  but too oily for my taste i'm sad about the noodles with beef and chili pepper  that used to be my favorite dish here  it was surprisingly spicy  plus i loved the fresh  slightly springy texture of the noodles  however  on my most recent visit  the peppers were lacking that zing of flavor and spice  and in turn the dish tasted a little bland  the noodles were also a little too soft the kung pao eel was    different  eel in place of chicken? interesting  it was too sweet and the ratio of fried batter to eel was so uneven  i guess i prefer the eel's natural flavor and texture hopefully they can cut back on the oil and return the noodles with beef and chili pepper to its former glory 
kinda love it here  it is popular and there is a line on the weekends  but they are efficient and will take your order while you're waiting  it's very clean and the decor is very authentic chinese and modern  the food is great   very authentic shanghainese and delicious! some of the best i've had anywhere in nyc  service is fast and efficient and friendly 
this is a limited review  and a more expanded review will come after trying more food  in the meantime i really wanted a chinese style breakfast  and my fake cousin and i went to get salty silky tofu  it was a bit too salty  and not clear enough for my taste  however  i did like that they added pork floss  if you order more than 10 dollars worth of food  they give you a basket of soup dumplings  i was not impressed by their soup dumplings  the skin was quite thick and the broth was boring  i would like to come back to try their noodles    it looks really good  not sure if the place is worth the wait that often accumulates 
they get a full star just because when you order soup to go  they give you a nifty bowl that has a tray like insert that separates the soup from the noodles  genius! saves the grief of that extra take out container of soup only naturally  as other reviews say  the xiao long bao soup dumplings are delicious  i haven't had the ones at their nearby competitor  but these were pretty damn fantastic to me  they pop with soupy goodness in your mouth and warm you up inside to out on a cold day like the ones we're finally having  i can't say i'm a xlb connoisseur because i rarely have the pleasure of eating them  i was always under the impression din tai fung was the only legitimate place you were allowed to eat them at  and there's none nearby  ( i have no complaints with this being my substitute though!i also ordered the cong you bing scallion pancakes and pork veggie noodle soup  the pancakes were some of the best i had to date in new york for its level of crispiness and right balance of chewy dough  so many others get so soggy and the dough tastes cheap  not here!and as for my noodle soup  it was fab  even in to go form and eaten the next day for lunch  imagine now how it would've tasted fresh off the stove!now  none of this was dirt cheap steals like flushing days of yore or maybe some other spots  but reliable taste and quality go a long way  the dining room interior was also really pleasant  a far cry from the chaos of the street it's located on  wouldn't hesitate to dine here again in the future  and look forward to re reviewing for the final star once i've had a taste of the full menu and dining experience 
i came here with a friend a few weeks ago at the recommendation of her relative who lives in flushing  quite early in the morning so there was no line  we ordered the the crab xlb ($6 75)  sweet sticky rice roll ($2 50)  soup filled bun ($2 99)  and got a complimentary pork xlb  i think it's been said enough how amazing the xlb are   thin skins and they don't stick together (!)  maybe the best i've had in the us   so i'm mostly writing this review to add pictures and clarify for anyone who might be confused as we were that the giant soup filled bun is in fact just filled with soup (with maybe negligible bits of crab)  it's very hot and you'll burn yourself drinking through the straw if you don't wait long enough  it looks cute but we found it salty and oily and difficult to drink  and the skin was (understandably) very thick   we didn't eat it highly recommended   delicious and inexpensive soup dumplings  but i'd avoid the soup filled bun
this fancier than usual flushing shanghainese restaurant offered a great deal of menu options with their most popular being their xiao long bao (soup dumplings)  the place was packed so if you could make a reservation i would recommend it  luckily for us  we were able to beat the crowd before the long line began forming they were giving complimentary xiao long bao for orders of $10 and up  the xiao long bao was good and broth was tasty  we had ordered the large soup dumpling as well  which was just soup with no meat on inside  i preferred the regular soup dumplings over that  the veggies  crispy sweet and sour fish  fried tofu  and seafood noodle were all good choices as well 
very fast seating for 8 people on a crowded saturday  we were able to get the private seating in the front  most memorable shanghai chicken   delicious sauce made it even better scallion pancake with beef  this was better than a lot of places i've tried little pepper dry noodle  omg the noodles  it wasn't really spicy  but then again i love spice  the noodles was so good i wanted to order more worth mentioning salted tofu dish  similar to your tofu fa from dim sum but it has preserved veggies  worth trying wouldn't say it's for everyone xiao long bao  very yummy soup base and the skin is very thin so you gotta be a pro to eat it lolspicy beef tendon  very good  we ordered this twice all in all service was very quick  lost one star for portion sizes  most dishes were small 
the restaurant is actually very easy to miss if you're doing your usual rushing down the sidewalk walk in flushing  that said  when it's busy  they do have a pretty decent system of trying to service all their customers as quickly as possible  while you're waiting in line  they ask you to peruse the menu to see if you'd like to order  this way  shortly after you're seated  the food comes out in a prompt fashion  the restaurant itself is quaint with a story written on the ceiling  the decor is average  to the food   the soup dumplings were ok   good but not memorably so  then they had a dumpling that is filled entirely with soup  it seems like it's a hit or miss with that dish  all four members of my family got one  and 2 tasted okay  the other 2 were very very salty  i couldn't finish mine  seemed pretty much gimmicky imo  the order of rice cake i had  seemed like they used old  dirty oil to cook it with  each bite had a flavor of rancid oil  everything else was fair  not bad yet not great  overall  the food needs better attention to detail  they have the service down pat  the food needs to come up to par considering there are soooo many competitors 
it wasn't the best i've had in flushing  the xlb were tender and juicy but flavor in the crabmeat wasn't great or very pronounced  the regular pork ones were better flavor  though i found the skin at the top of the bao a bit tough  the shanghai seafood noodle was extremely overpriced for the amount  $9 95 for a tiny plate with just a few pieces of seafood  very oily and lacking in flavor  i would not recommend ordering service was fantastic for not only a asian establishment but friendly! so stars for that  it's kind of cleanly  but grossed out the chili oil on my table had a hair inside of it  didn't notice until i was done eating  so  wah wah wahhhh probably won't be returning
only came in here for a quick lunch  but this place is legit! have been dying to find good  wholesome chinese food that's not overpriced (looking at you manhattan china town)  and i only have to travel an hr and 15 on the subway to get there i had the crab and pork xlbs (xiao long bao   soup dump) beef scallion pancake and also an xlxlb (extra large xia long bao) completely a gimmick  but wanted to try) xlbs   really good  nice soup  very flavorful dumpling and the casing was just the right thickness and texture beef scallion pancake   this really was a beast  flavor wise  absolutely delicious  however was a little heavy on the pancake and light on the beef for my likingxl xlb   i really would not bother  i was suspicious of this before i ordered it  but thought i would try  one of the beauty's of a regular xlb is that you get the taste of the casing  soup and meat all in one go  it's the mixture of textures  with the xl xlb  naturally it's so big that it's served with a straw  that means you have to drink the soup first  and then you're just left with the casing  secondly  the soup merely has a few chunks of meat in it  rather than its own little meat ball  do not botherthat aside  the menu here is insane  so much choice  there was a family next to me doing a sunday lunch  going to town on all the greats and it looked and smelled amazing  will definitely be back to try more!the best bit is when you spend $10  you get a free portion of xlbs  for our meal of 2 x xlxlbs  beef scallion pancake and free xlbs  the meal set us back $11 95 nice
this is the the best and the most authentic shanghai restaurant in new york in my opinion; as someone who was born and raised in shanghai  i think this place really reminds me of my hometown  hearing all the servers talking in shanghai dialect gives me a homey and nostalgic feeling as well  this restaurant stands out from the crowd for one major reason   both their shanghai dim sum and actual entrees are all very authentic and tasty  most restaurants tends to specialize in either the dim sum or the entrees; while at this restaurant  no matter what you order  you won't be disappointed  you can also find delicious dishes not sold anywhere else  such as fried yellow croaker with diced seaweed (苔条小黄鱼)  which seriously tastes like childhood  they also have the best soup dumplings   i think they give you for free pork ones if you dine in is over a certain dollar amount  but i prefer the crabs ones because of more flavor  what's more  they also have pork moon cake (鲜肉月饼) and green sticky rice buns (青团)  which are seriously authentically delicious and hard to find outside of the the region  i highly recommend this place   everything is good here  service is a little rushed but adequate  since they are busy 
this place had excellent service maybe because they have around 8 10 staff on a weekday  we came in around 5 30pm and it wasn't too busy yet  however when we left it was getting pretty busy  you can see the place in one look  it's a straight line; the decoration was beautifully designed  i order shanghai noodles  the crispy noodles with sauce (too much sauce)  and ha gow  i have no idea why we order ha gow (shrimp inside with the white skin on the outside)  it is definitely better at dim sum places because the skin just fell apart very easily   i liked the shanghai noodles and we also got free soup dumpling for checking in as long as you spent more than $10  overall the bill was $20ish for 2  which is very inexpensive because we got the soup dumpling for free  they also give dessert at the end  this is a reminder they do cash only  it's a good thing i brought cash or i would have to go to the bank  service was worth giving more than 15 percent 
oh my goodness yes  this has definitely become my favorite shanghainese chinese breakfast place in all of new york city  the food is authentic and fairly priced  the service is quick and pretty competent  the ambiance is lively  and the decor isn't as run down as other authentic places  i came here with a friend for tuesday lunch and it was already popping!! we had to wait 5 minutes for a weekday lunch which is so rare at that time  even with that small wait  there are ample seats to wait in and the waiters give you menus and let you order first so your food are ready when you sit down  and for the most important part        the soup dumplings 1  they don't break when you pick them up  so many places serve dumplings that break  which sucks because the whole point is to be able to suck out the soup  2  you get a free order of soup dumplings if you spend more than $10  they probably do this because their soup dumplings are just that good and it's really not hard to spend over $10  especially when you're eating with other people all in all  amazing find and tucked away in an often not visited street of flushing 
i had such high expectations from the pictures and yelp reviews  heard about the long lines and waits so i wanted to try so bad  ordered the spicy beef tripe  cold cucumbers  crab meat dumpling (regular dumpling on the house)  the big soup dumpling  grandma's pork belly  the stinky tofu sautéed in sauce  and the beef scallion pancake  first of all  everything was on the sweeter side  cucumbers was crunchy but why the added sweetener? spicy beef tripe was tasty but was average  crab meat dumplings were a little better than the original  you can get better soup dumplings in the area  beef scallion pancakes had very little beef and sauce  the skin was too rocky and chewy  no crunch! pork belly taste was ok  the meat can be braised a little longer so the fat wasn't too chewy  the big soup dumpling is overhyped! literally just soup inside  no meat  it was very bland  tasted fishy if you don't drink it while it's hot  taste like crab shell water  get you what you pay  think it was $2 3 worst dish was the stinky tofu! i've tried many many stinky tofu and this one is horrible  yes  it's suppose to be stinky but when u eat it  you're not suppose to taste the stink  i think the tofu expired or something  was asked a waiter and he just walked away and was nowhere to be found  he didn't say anything  i asked him to take it away so i can at least finish the rest of the food  nope! he wanted to avoid us  lastly i wanted to say the staffs weren't every clean  we sat at the very last table on the right and i'm looking straight at this waitress cleaning the edge of the sauce container with hare bare finger when refilling it  she saw me looking and continued  i know this isn't a fancy place but all restaurants should have some kind of hygiene practice  tea tasted like bad water     won't recommend this place and won't come back  spend your money somewhere else in flushing 
despite not being a fan of soup dumplings  all of the times i have eaten here  i have been extremely satisfied  the wait staff will automatically give you a free order of soup dumplings as long as your bill is over $10  no check in necessary  be aware when you order because you might end up with too much food or could potentially pay for one less order of soup dumplings if you order multiples like my friends do i thoroughly enjoyed all the dishes i've tried such as their rice cakes  stir fry noodles  noodle soups  spicy wontons  wonton soup  gluten  cucumber  spicy tendon  drunken chicken  seaweed flavoured fried fish and i am a major fan of their fried stinky tofu  the stinky tofu is a very big reason why i give shanghai you garden 4 stars  i do sometimes feel bad for people that can't stand the smell of it but c'mon!  that's exactly the reason why you're reading my review  this is a heads up for you that the restaurant will 100% smell of stinky tofu cooking in the kitchen or being brought out to another customers table at some point during your meal  they also offer a much more pungent  in my opinion  alternative version to the traditional stinky tofu  this one comes with a braised meat sauce with bits of edamame over the stinky tofu i would avoid ordering the giant soup dumpling and the free dessert tong sui unless you are a fan of chinese rice wine  note  i had the great idea of surprising a friend with a birthday cake here  the wait staff very obviously never prepared or anticipated for this and did not know what to do when i asked if they could put the cake in the kitchen and or when to know the social cue to bring it out for my group of friends  so maybe this isn't a great place for having celebratory cake 
great place for xiaolongbao and other shanghainese snacks  i've been here a couple times   they have a special promotion where you get a free order of xiaolongbao with any order over $10  which is awesome  the xiaolongbao is on point  thin  almost translucent skin  flavorful filling and scalding broth  exactly as it should be  also recommend the braised pork belly  the turnip puffs  the pan fried buns  the drunken chicken  and the stir fried rice cake with mustard greens  although they have a bunch of noodle soups but suggest skipping these  there are much better noodle options in flushing  overall would definitely recommend if you're in the mood for shanghainese carbs 
spend $10 and get an order of soup dumplings! had the typical preserved veggie with pork and rice cakes dish  beef and scallion pancake  along with the big $2 99 "soup" dumpling  why soup is in quotations? there's no filling just soup so i thought i'd put an emphasis on that (could totally skip it not worth the hype)  everything was very inexpensive for flushing prices  i think an order of soup dumplings and nan xiang are $6+? or somewhere around that but the dumplings here are far less oily or fatty tasting 
i think it's safe to say the really popular shanghainese place on prince street is still king  i went here on the recommendation from a friend and i thought the food was just ok  the place is pretty popular and the waits can be long  so try to go early  the decor is typical chinese restaurant and i hate to say it  but the male bathroom is also typical chinese bathroom  if you know what i mean  the food steamed pork bun  the soup dumpling broth was good  but i had issues with the dough  the dough was way too thick  the dough was thick on both the top as well as the bottom of the dumpling  the pork flavor was not bad  but the dough kinda overwhelmed the dumpling  also  if you order over $10 worth of food  they give you a free order of steamed pork buns  yelp com user_local_phot…pan fried pork bun  the pan fried had good flavor but was super oily on the outside  it was so visibly oily that i had to pat it dry with a tissue  i also felt this bun had too much dough  yelp com user_local_phot…cucumber & garlic  this was the shocker appetizer  this was my fav dish of the night and it was a cucumber dish??? the texture of the cucumber was so firm yet tender at the same time  this was really good  yelp com user_local_phot…spicy beef & tripe  i have had this at many chinese restaurants and the one here was just so so  the flavor was pretty good but the dish came off very salty  the tripe was nice and tender but the beef needed to be cooked more  yelp com user_local_phot…rice cake w  shredded pork & preserved vegetable  the rice cakes were made well  they had a really nice texture and the overall flavor worked  the dish was a touch sweet but overall something worth ordering  yelp com user_local_phot…pan fried noodle w  shredded chicken  the pan fried noodle was my least fav  there was way too much sauce and it made the dish very gloppy  the dish was also greasy and came off salty  the dish has to be eaten lightning quick since the nice crunchy noodles will get soggy quick  yelp com user_local_phot…
free order of soup dumplings for checking in? i'm down!the soup dumplings are delicious so i usually get an extra order (it also helps that they are reasonably priced)  the rice cake dishes are pretty good too  and at the end of your meal  they give you a sweet soup as dessert  they get pretty packed around dinner time (starting from around 7pm)  you take a number from the lady with a clipboard who is usually standing by the entrance  then  you wait outside a while (be prepared to stand because there's only a few chairs)  when your number is called  they take you inside where you have to wait some more (at least there's more seats and you're protected from the elements)  when you're waiting inside  they give you a menu so that you can place your order in advance  however  not sure if this even mattered as we still had to wait a while to get our food after being seated at an actual table   the restaurant itself seems pretty clean and the waiters are friendly  they speak chinese and english  seats are pretty close together though  so it can get kinda loud in here  if you are a group of 4 or less  try to snag a booth (more space)  don't try to come here with a large group because you might have to wait a long time  it was just the two of us and we were quoted about 25 min  wait time  didn't get seated until 45+ min later!maybe come here during lunch hours as it seemed less hectic and was definitely not as crowded as during dinner time (and we were able to snag a table for two pretty easily) 
very traditional shanghainese restaurant with fantastic xlb  we also tasted some of the dim sum dishes that are available at dinner time  the food was very tasty  and the service was excellent  i expected a larger variety of dumplings and condiments (if you serve dim sum you should have hoisin and mustard imo)  overall a great experience  we will be back    with our own hoisin
service was excellent! soup dumplings were very good! i can't and could never have stinky tofu again in my life     i think the cup noodle soup is much better than their noodle soup    it was so bland! i guess it was meant to be!
definitely coming back here!! i've had many a soup dumpling and these are some of the best! they're thin and full of soup and pork  and the deal of getting a free serving is totally worth it  came with family and some friends and we all enjoyed the food  had the thick cut pork belly and it was so sweet and tasty  we were the only white people in the restaurant which i take as a good sign  if the locals are there then it's good 
came in here on a friday late morning for brunch  there was a line to get in so i assumed that t was pretty good  we had to take a number and then wait about 30 min to get a seat  typical chinese restaurant in flushing  very busy  cash only  we got a menu and placed an order in advance so when we got to our seat  the food would come immediately because we were hungry  ordered the fries gluten  pretty good  ordered the large soup dumplings  they give it with a straw  it was not that great but it looks great for photos  the large soup dumplings taste like the broth has crab mean or flavoring in there  but it's not worth it  ordered extra regular soup dumplings and they were pretty good  only thing is that the skin of them are a little thin so they may break pretty easily when you try to pick it up  overall pretty good though 
$30 for 5 dishes? yessssss  the service is relatively fast  there is a rush of people so the waiters want you to eat quickly and leave  i would recommend getting here before the initial lunch rush so you don't have to wait for a table  noodles  actually really good and wasn't expecting dating this to be this good  they were crispy and plentiful for $10  the sauce was just right    not too salty  there was also a lot of shrimp and pork  scallion pancake  really inexpensive and filling  the pancake is filled with beef and smothered in sauce that tastes like the one in peking duck  only $3 50 or something so definitely worth it  xiaolong bao  make sure to eat it once it gets to you  we ate it after a while and the fat solidified  wasn't sure if they didn't steam it long enough or it was cooled down after it got to us  it's what they're known for so get it  you also get a free pork one if you get more than $10  pan fried dumpling  the filling was a combination of meat and lots of veggies  i'm not completely sure about what kind of vegetable it was but it seemed like spinach or chives  it was okay     lots of other places sell cheaper dumplings like this 
my favorite place in flushing  pretty much come here every time i'm in the neighborhood  come early as there is always a long line  free order of soup dumplings if you order more than $10 and free dessert  fantastic shanghainese specialties all for great prices  yes it's loud and the servers are pushy  but the food makes it all worth it
my ultimate favorite shanghai restaurant  nothing beats the food  the price and how quickly you get served here! wait  there is almost always a wait  but it's worth it  you can make a reservation in advance which will bring you to the "top" of the waiting list  but that does not guarantee you seating as soon as you arrive  price  super affordable  full bellies (too full)  they give you a free pork soup dumpling with your meal assuming you are ordering over a total of $10go to dishes  everything  it is best when the food is cooked fresh and it almost always is because there is such a large crowd  they're really known for their meat filled moon cakes  soup dumplings (even one dumpling that is filled with just soup   served with a straw) and of course the many other signature shanghai dishes  authentic food  good price  must visit
i honestly didn't know this place existed because it has a side door in a street that i don't really walk by  but i came here through a friend's suggestion  when we walked in  it was about 5pm ish  there was no wait and we were seated right away  in terms of seating  they seat you together with another group in one table (especially if you don't have a large party)  they try to fill the empty seats from tables first before filling up another table to get as many people seated as possible  when looking at the menu  they have a lot of similar dishes to a typical soup dumpling place since my friend and i wanted soup dumpling  we got that  it tasted like normal soup dumplings  no surprise there  **if you spend more than $10  you get a free pan of steamed pork buns (yes  it has soup inside) we also got the pan fried beef noodles  which i suggest because soup dumplings itself is not very filling  lastly  we opted for the soup filled bun  it looks like the popular xl soup dumplings and i never got to try it  so i definitely wanted to test it out  however  i was very disappointed    it is literally a soup filled  larger than normal bun  it has very tiny chucks of crab meat inside  first of all  the soup was not good (rating 2 5)  and second of all  i'm not a fan of crab  but  my friend who likes crab said that she didn't really like it either  so  we were both let down  other than that  everything else was great  the free steamed pork bun deal definitely made up for the disappointing soup bun 
my mother and i arrived at around 5 45pm on a saturday evening to find the restaurant already packed  we waited for about 10 minutes  during which a waiter took our order so that the dishes arrived soon after we were seated  the place is fairly narrow with a limited number of booths (note for people with large parties)  also note  free dish of steamed dumplings for orders over $10! the waiter told us about the deal even without my showing him the yelp check in offer  we ordered the steamed crab dumplings $6 95 and the eight treasure steamed rice delicacy ($5 95)  the soup dumplings were indeed full of soup  i appreciated that the dumplings had a soft thin skin  with good skin to meat to soup ratio  what i did not appreciate was the misleading name of the steamed crab dumplings  since the filling actually very little crab and actually quite a lot of pork filling  the restaurant should actually mention pork in the description  while i might have been naive to assume that the filling would have been all crab (given the price)  i would have thought twice about ordering the dish  besides the misleading description of the crab dumplings  i'm also docking a star for the fact that they don't offer vegetarian soup dumplings (except for the large dumpling of $2 99 with solely soup inside)  that's not to say that they don't have vegetarian options  they do  but not even a chive option for the soup dumplings  the eight treasure dish was generous in portion  but didn't have eight treasures  i counted the red bean  dates  grapes  and lotus seed  unless there were others i missed  we were also given a small complimentary bowl of goji berry rice wine soup  very bland with way too many filler rice balls  but a nice touch at the end of the meal in any case  service was ostensibly better than at most chinese restaurants  with the wait staff friendly and helpful  the interior is quite lovely  i could bring my more fastidious caucasian friends and family here in the future (but on the early side to avoid the long wait) 
really enjoyed my meal here! although i can't really say that any of the food really blew my mind in terms of taste or uniqueness  i'd still have to give this restaurant 5 stars because it's just run so well and efficiently and the food is good  the price is also very reasonable  plus a free basket of soup dumplings is super generous of them to offer  (though i ended up ordering more food than i needed because i didn't want to take advantage of it~)the soup dumpling here is really good though  perfect in flavor and texture  service is excellent and quick in a good way  they had us order food while waiting to be seated so the food comes fairly quick after being seated and the line moves along  you get a pot of tea with your meal too  and the place is clean  the only thing i would dock maybe  5 stars about is that the stir friend rice cake dish and the fried spare rib that we had was a tad bit too oily  i'd definitely still come back soon though~
a 3 5 restaurant  4 is encouragement  to do better  i've been a faithful costumer of their take out store when they were still at the old location  which was corner of main street and 40th road (an old post and video during chinese new year 2012  ireneeng com ?p=40643)  after they moved to the current location  a few doors down to 40th road  i followed them  their bbq ribs  duckies  chickens are very good  they accepted credit card over $30 purchase  then one day earlier this year  they stopped accepting credit card  which made me stop going  recently another popular eatery in flushing  a block away  nanxiang xiaolongbao was closed for tax evasion  the government is not dumb   they have a 'blue book' for restaurants  so    today i went here with a family member  which is cross street from their take out store  which is a surprise to me  so close and i used to go so often  yet didn't discover this one  it's very busy at 1 pm  we waited for 30 minutes  when we left around 2pm  the restaurant's slowing down   the waiting line was gone  the decor is ok  for this type of eatery  service is good  food is 4 0 out of 5 
a close japanese friend of mine is moving away from new york city  he wanted to try a good authentic soup dumpling near flushing area  and we narrowed it down to shanghai you garden due to all the positive reviews and pictures on yelp  upon arrival  we were greeted by a friendly lady staff outside of the restaurant  she gave us a number and told us to wait outside  a few minutes later  we were asked to go inside  as we walked through the main door  the dumpling making and steaming stations were immediately on our left  you can watch these ladies making soup dumplings through the glass like a fish tank  after the dumpling station  there's a cold dish station serving fried bean gluten  jellyfish turnip and etc  a few minutes later  we were seated  the whole process of taking a number  waiting  and seating was very systematic  i applaud their management for making it less anxiety we were presented with a beautiful picture menu  sometimes  a picture menu is far more helpful for someone who is not familiar with the shanghainese cuisine  the waiter casually mentioned if we ordered more than $10  we will get a set of soup dumpling  we were surprised and pleased  one thing i learned from eating at shanghai you garden  is that shanghainese food  in general  is not as spicy as compared to szechuan style  we came here for their famous soup dumpling and did not disappoint  several dishes really stand out from the rest are the fried croaked fish  fried bean gluten  black fungus  grandma's braised pork  and the red bean rice cake i minus one star from the review due to cash only  all in all  i am glad that i've tried this place and really enjoyed most of the dishes here  will be back soon 
i have lived in flushing for most of my life so i have had my fair share of pork buns but this place definitely ranks high on my top ten list  while walking to the lirr one sunday in the clusterfunk that is main street  i randomly saw a huge line outside of a restaurant and decided to mentally and literally bookmark it so i too would know what the hype was about   i ended up coming back later that week with my mom on a thursday night and only having to wait 10 minutes which was fine with me because i got to watch the women actually make the dumplings right in front of you   the speed and efficiency in which they work is pretty incredible and watching it is deeply hypnotizing  the space is bright and spacious as well as lively   we ordered the crab and pork buns  scallion pancake with beef  shanghai noodles  and fried ribs with garlic sauce   we also ended up getting a complimentary order of the pork buns which was a random bless up moment   everything came out fast  hot  and fresh   the ribs were a little on the fatty side but i didn't mind it cause it was so crispy and the bits of fried garlic helped to cut through the fattiness   having had both buns  my mom and i definitely preferred the pork over the crab   the pork was just so flavorful and tender and soupy and just the best thing for when the day is under 55 degrees   the crab tasted a little tough and were not as delicate as i prefer   the shanghai noodles were amazing   talk about comfort   served with thin strips of pork and bok choy  noodles obviously hand pulled and had a good bite to it   the scallion pancake with beef was lit as the kids say     order it  even if you don't finish it  take it to go   next morning cook a sunny side up egg put that on top and call it breakfast   boom   you're welcome this place is great  it has pictures of everything on their menu   the waitstaff was super friendly and you get a complimentary dessert   i mean really what more could you want from your local bun place   great experience will for sure be coming back!
awesome spot for shanghainese food  there's an extensive menu with dumplings  noodles  cold appetizers    don't come here expecting dimsum though because that's more of a cantonese thing pros  affordable  great variety  decently nice interior  food comes extremely fastcons  can be hectic  can feel rushed  cash onlyit's always a good idea to start off with hot sweet soy milk and crispy dough to dunk into it  my go to appetizer is kaofu gluten (sounds weird  but it's like spongy tofu + bamboo + mushrooms marinated in sweet soy sauce)  i also loved the noodles with scallion sauce (dried fragrant scallion tossed with soy sauce based sauce)  handmade dumplings (high quality pork and leek filling)  soup dumplings (duh) which is buy 2 get 1 free  pass on the wontons in spicy sauce unless you like peanut butter the panfried pork buns are probably the best in nyc because there's actually soup in there  but only a teaspoon  i was sad that the scallion pancake with beef wasn't as good as nanxiang   too much pancake and not enough beef  the rice cakes with shredded pork were just ok  i prefer my rice cakes cooked longer until slightly gooey  if you want a taste of some pretty legit shanghai food and great xiaolongbao  i highly recommend making a reservation   i booked a table the day before for noon on a saturday and skipped the long line 
we arrived around 1 30 pm on saturday (labor day weekend) and already tons of people were in line waiting that went out of the restaurant  many were families of 4 or more  we had two and were told the wait time was at least 30 minutes  we got our number and were given the menu to look at 15 20 minutes later  staff came to is and took our orders so that we could start eating soon after we sit down  after ordering  we moved to inside the restaurant and waited for another 15 minutes or so less than 5 minutes after we sat down  our food started to come out   we ordered a lot of stuff  shanghai style pork moon cake ($8 for 4)  savory sticky rice roll ($2 75)  millet rick cake ($1 25)  sticky rice balls with salted yolk ($10 for 4)  pork and chinese vegetables wonton soup ($5 5 for 8)  fried stinky bean curd ($7)  plain soymilk ($1 5)  sweet sky bean curd ($1 5)  chinese vegetables with bean curd stir fry ($5 5)  and a soup filled bun for each of us ($2 99 each)  *** they offer a free case of shanghai pork buns (xiaolongbao) per table  if you are not here specifically for the buns  or you just want to have a flavor of it  you don't need to order extras or the individual soup filled buns  *** i everything was delicious  but i really loved their   sticky rice balls with salted yolks (青团)  chewy doughy sticky rice (think of mochi) itself has no taste (maybe a little herbal or grass taste  if you are familiar with asian cooking)  but goes so well with slightly salted yolk and shredded dried pork  so tasty!    sticky rice roll with fried dough inside (糯米团子)  i simply love anything made with sticky rice and my favorite  fried dough!!! it's not seasoned with heavy sauce or anything but salt  and the fried dough has also simple sweetness from just the dough  what makes it yummy is they have these sweet and salty crispy pickles that enrich the taste and texture    millet rick cake (糍粑)  one of my favorites and i haven't had it for over 10 years!!! very simple taste  just some salt  black pepper  and pan fried sticky rice! so chewy but unlike the sticky balls  you can feel you are chewing rice itself  reminds me of my childhood!!!!   pork and chinese vegetables wonton soup  gooey wonton skins and a lot of fillings  had the original flavors of the meat and vegetables     soy milk and sweet soybean curd  a large bowl of soy milk as well as bean curd and they both were only $1 5!!! i didn't finish my soymilk and had it taken home the only thing you can skip  imo  is the soup filled buns  it's a bit big  the soup was delicious  but too greasy and salty  the bun skin was really thick in order to keep the soup inside the bun  so it's not easy to eat  and the bottom of the bun absorbed all the oil from the soup  making it fattening and less tasty  the price for the dim sum is reasonable since the portion is large and the taste is yummy  would go back for takeout (yes  they have takeout!)
great dim sum all day long  first  we had the crispy pork bun  the bun was crispy and flakey  i added the pepper paste for enhanced spiciness  next  we had the soup dumplings and crab soup dumplings  the regular (i believe pork) dumplings are complimentary  i liked the regular ones a little more than the crab  yet they were both savory and delicious  after  we had the spicy beef tendon  it's served cold and thinly sliced  it has a jelly like texture  i enjoyed it  lastly  we had the fried pork bao  this last one was my favorite because the bao absorbed the juiciness of the meat  i also thought it was seasoned the best all in all  the service was quick and attentive  we found it reasonable priced considering we sampled five dishes for about $30  parking on 40th road is difficult  so you may want to park elsewhere and walk to the restaurant 
we try to get xiao long bao every time we are in flushing and used to go to nan xiang a lot  but there's always a pretty ridiculous wait there  when we came here (for lunch)  there was no wait so we were pretty happy about that  the restaurant is also nicely renovated and feels pretty clean the soup dumplings are solid but some of the other food is not authentic  the wuxi spareribs  for example  were memorable for being huge  but did not look or taste the way wuxi spareribs are supposed to look taste we'll be back for the soup dumplings  but only if there's no wait 
@charlotte and i haven't been to flushing much  so we picked the closest thing to the mall since we were starving  the best part of this place is the soup dumplings that they make fresh in the front of the restaurant  check in for a free steamer of xiao long bao! such an awesome deal  we got this veggie dish called indica because that's a classification of weed   plus we're immature  turned out to be minced bean curd and green veg and actually delish  the noodles with beef were way over cooked and all mushed together  braised pork belly could have been a lot softer and didn't come with rice  still ate a ton bc i was starving  we spent a total of $40 for two which is great in my book  cash only!!
i love shanghai you garden! we as a group of 4 came at ~6pm and were seated immediately  we ordered way too much food  but everything was so delicious  we had scallion cake  shu mai  xlb pork and pork +crab  cucumber garlic  chicken special  chicken in wine sauce  lo mein  sweet and sour fried fish  my fav was definitely the xlb and fried fish  the fried fish was so crunchy and flavorful  and the soup from xlb was superb  the staff was friendly  food was served quickly  at the end we were given free dessert (some kind of sweet congee) but i dont really like its taste  i'll recommend my friends if they want a good restaurant in flushing  remember to check in for a free xlb!!!
our second shanghai restaurant experience in flushing  this might not be a fair competition given that we ordered many more dishes  but we like you garden better than nanxiang  first off  you get six xiao long bao for free! the staff is fast and friendly (a funny guy took our order witt great humor)  though we waited half an hour for a saturday lunch  we were happy with everything we ordered in the end  especially the crab xiao long bao  after lunch we packed some shanghai style sticky rice desserts home  and they are all delicious  we will definitely come back when having a crave for good shanghai dim sum 
i am very very disappointed shanghai you garden! my aunt was visiting from california and after a long 6+ hours flight  i told her we have the best shanghai in nyc and i decided to take her to your place as her first meal in nyc and you serve us nothing but raw chicken and egg shell in wonton?!? also  your soy bean is not smooth  in fact  it was not that great  the only reason why i left some stars on is because your salty bean curd is still delicious and your staffs are nice and were helpful 
a friend told me about this place offering free soup dumplings with yelp check in  sure  why not give it try  who isnt a fan of soup dumplings and especially when its free? it was way fancier than we expected  almost felt underdressed  i mean  we were almost in our pjs  lol  tables are very big and even the chairs are heavy  but just because they spend money on decor that doesnt mean the food is good it was packed for a sunday night  we arrived at 930 or so  and good thing it they are opened until 11  they have a section next to the cashier when you walk in for the soup dumplings  it is prepared and made there to order once we sat  i showed the waiter the free soup dumpling special  very friendly staff  always attentive  since we got the soup dumplings for free  we ordered an extra dish  we got two entrees  the meatball with crab meat  general tsos chicken and rather than getting the white rice we got a noodle it was a little on the salty side for me  just a bit but overall the food wasnt bad  the meatball dish was bigger than expected  so we didnt finish that  the general tsos chicken was very good to end the meal  they had some sweet dough dumpling soup  it was a great way to finish the meal and not your typical fruit 
solid xiao long baos (not literally)  there's always a long line but it goes quick! it's worth the wait  i like that the place is spacious and you have ample table space for all your baos  the crab & pork xiao long baos are the thing to get here  comparable to nan xiang  thin skin  soup inside  crab meat  they also gave us complimentary pork xiao long baos  i think  because of the wait  if you check in on yelp  they also do the same  (i did check in on yelp but didn't show them    unless they thought we looked like yelpers and just gave it to us automatically?)
love the fact that they open early at 8 am and really appreciate their spend $10 or more  get a free pork soup dumplings deal  my friend and i came here for breakfast around 10 am with the intention to try their soup dumplings out since we've already been to all the other xlb places in flushing except for this one  the restaurant is located right across from corner 28 and was pretty small but clean with a nice interior  plenty of street parking nearby but not in front since you can't park at those spaces 'til 7 pm  the staff were very nice and friendly  probably because my friend was speaking to them in their language  we ordered the crab meat & pork soup dumplings  pork soup dumplings and pan fried pork buns  the soup dumplings weren't the best i've ever had but they were still decent and flavorful with just the right amount of broth inside  the pan fried pork buns was a bit oily and the skin was sorta thick but it was quite tasty  it even had broth inside just like the soup dumplings  i'd definitely come back here again 
they have amazing pork and crab xiao long bao i always go there for that but they need more english speaking people
i think this is my so's favorite chinese restaurant in all of the world  so ten stars for that  everything is pretty solid in this restaurant  i guess the thing i appreciate is food is more or less consistent  as is service  they're very popular but they're pretty smart about seating and turning over tables  they also work together as a team  i appreciate this place  will be back!
i came here because my friend said this was her favorite soup dumpling joint to go to  sort of hard to find  but it's right next to t mobile  i came here with a party of 4 on a sunday  we made reservations for 5pm  and good thing we did because it was super packed  it was so busy that i found it hard to flag down anyone  if you order more than $10  they give you an order of soup dumplings for free! their shanghai udon noodles were really good  so was the spicy bamboo shoots  vinegar cucumbers and their pancakes  i don't recommend their beef pancakes   the meat was too old and tough  i was expecting ground beef but this was dry  the soup dumplings were pretty good  the dumpling skin never broke  that's a plus! probably my go to spot for soup dumplings!  their dessert soup was a nice surprise  it was warm rice wine with mochi  egg and goji berries 
really fast paced restaurant in flushing  new york!they serve a delicious free pork xlb which is the reason why i wanted to go to this restaurant   my family and i are here a couple days ago and i wanted to come here again to take my friend   the food was on point and very quickly made 
this is the best dim sum spot in my opinion! to be honest i think this is better than nan xiang xiao long bao  although  i would avoid coming here on the weekends because it is beyond packed  the service here is quick and the place is very clean! i also got a free bao for checking in!this is what i ordered iced soy milk ($2)  this is really good and a little sweet  goes great with the food there!shanghai egg roll ($1 50)  very flavorful  it is a little on the oily side tho  fried bun w  chives and egg ($3 95)  this was okay  i can't say i would go crazy for it  the flavor was a little bland and there wasn't that much filling  the skin was a little hard to bite too pan fried pork bun ($6 50 for 6) i actually didn't eat this the day of  kind of got to much food  i reheated this two days later and it was still spectacular! the filling was juicy and flavorful and the skin was soft  but crispy on the bottom!pork and vege wonton in spicy sauce ($4 95)  this was probably the worst in all the dishes i ordered  they put peanut butter in the sauce which made it taste really funky  the filling was bland and nothing about the wonton was spicy  spicy beef tripe ($7 95)  i highly recommend this dish  it was excellent  variety of flavors in the beef and tripe  the tripe was done to a perfection  where you can't taste the nasty flavors  soy peas  pickled cabbage & shredded bean curd ($3 95)  this was not what i expected  tasted very nice and very well put together  i just needed vegetables in my life big soup dumpling ($2)  if you do not like crab tasting or fishy food  do not order this!! there is no filling on the inside but  there was a lot of soup in the dumpling pork soup dumpling (free)  this was just like any other soup dumpling you get at dim sum places  it was pretty good the portion here are pretty small so  you can try a lot of stuff  i was stuffed by the time i left  would highly recommend this place!
i had a variety of items on our first visit here  steam pork buns (free with yelp promo!!!)steam crab meat pork buns (must have)shrimp dumplingpork & vegetable wonton in peanut chili saucespicy beef tripe (best dish)grandma style braised porkpan fried noodles with porkrice cake with beef (least favorite   too salty)giving a four star because it was cash only   (overall  i had a great time  fast service and delicious food 
this place is the bomb   clean inside  plenty of space  great price on delicious food!  there's usually a wait in the evening but they have a great system down for handing out numbers and as it approaches your turn to get a table they'll come outside and take your order so that as soon as you are seated your food is coming out hot  we tried a bunch of stuff shrimp dumplingspan fried dumplingsvegetable dumplingssoup dumplingsscallion pancakescrystal shrimpcrispy noodles with seafoodxiaolongbaoalso  their xiao long bao is amazing   thick enough dough to not tear when you pick it up but not so thick that it's super chewy   and easily the richest soup broth i've ever had in xlb this is a go to place for sure 
crappy service here  all the employees treat the paying customer like a piece of trash here  fyi it's the same owner here as the duck shop across the street  food was tolerable  purchased the soft tofu
had a disaster experience here not because of the place  but because i let the juice of the xiao long bao blast all over my clothes   the food and service here is pretty good! we ordered 1 crab meat xiao long bao  2 spare ribs w  garlic sauce  1 shanghai noodle  1 beef scallion pancake  and got a free order of pork xiao long bao the xiao long bao is good  but i still think there are better ones in flushing  the meat inside was a little tough  and the outer skin was a little dry  the shanghai noodles were as it should be  and delicious! the scallion pancake wasn't my favorite  the meat was very chewy and hard to eat  but the flavor was ok the spare ribs with garlic sauce was a big mistake  i was expecting something similar to when you eat at chinese restaurants  but it was completely different  every bite was oily and tasteless  i would not recommend this dish the price is very reasonable and the food overall was doable  i'd come back again 
great soup dumplings and service! not to mention it's definitely the prettiest one in the area  when in flushing  i usually go either joe shanghai or nan xiang  maybe even kung fu (which is further  but still)  anyway  i think it's safe to say that this is a new go to for me! the free order of xlb also helps  when we came in on a saturday night  there was about a half hour wait  once we did get seated  the server took our order right away  set us up with some tea  and food came out pretty quickly  we had pork buns  the udon noodles  two orders of xlb  and one "giant" xlb  i liked that the menu had pictures of everything and it was organized in a way that made sense to me  everything was delicious  the xlb had a good broth  and the dumpling was thin but sturdy enough to hold everything in  the giant xlb wasn't really what i was expecting   it was all soup and no meat  it made for good pictures  but i wouldn't order it again  lastly  they ended our meal  inexplicably with jiu niang  neither me nor my boyfriend had had it before  but it smelled like sake and the balls were chewy so we were a fan!
i wish there was a 3 5 star option  we actually really enjoyed our meal  but two out of our party had gi issues after our visit  however  while we were there  it impressed us enough that we were already making plans to come back with family  my husband was born in shanghai so we have eaten our fair share of shanghainese food  i will be comparing the food to nan xiang since that is my go to shanghainese place  the koufu (gluten) was a little bit more firmer and less oily than the one at nan xiang  so it is a tie there in terms of flavor  the shanghai noodles were a lot mushier at shanghai you  seems like they boil the udon  it seems a lot firmer at nan xiang  almost like they fry their noodles and i like the salt pepper powder they use at nan xiang  the skin on the soup dumplings are a little thicker  so less breakage  soy bean milk was on the sweeter side  the salted silken tofu dish was very good  the yuoteow is better at nan xiang  but the decor and service is better at shanghai you  don't forget the free order or pork soup dumplings through yelp  nan xiang still wins in my book  but i plan to go back for dinner to try their other traditional shanghainese dishes that nan xiang does not offer like the dipong (pork belly)  hope my husband and mother in law are willing to give it another shot given their gi issues  the giant soup dumpling was probably the cause 
everything we ate was incredible  but the soup dumplings are amazing! and when you spend over $10  you get a portion of soup dumplings for free!!
i was looking for a place in flushing with amazing soup dumplings  with the plethora of restaurants in ny  it's so hard to find "the best" anything  i read a thrillist or eater type article about "where to find the best soup dumplings in flushing" and shanghai you garden came up as one of them  and to be perfectly honest  i'm not totally sold  though i've had plenty of sds that are good  i've never had one that rocked my world  shanghai you garden is exactly that   good  but not amazing  if i have sd cravings  i can certainly come here and be satisfied  but i'm still on the hunt for those sds that will change me  if you know where i can find sds that will give me a new perspective on life  please please please help me find them  one more thing to note   when you get there  someone will be outside taking names  they will always tell you 20 minutes  doesn't sound too bad right? well  20 minutes really just gets you into the door and waiting again  then you spend another 20 minutes waiting for your table  but the smart thing that they do is that while you are waiting for your table to clear up  they take your order  that way when you finally sit  your food starts to come out pretty quickly  i see what you did there shanghai you garden  i see you 
shanghai you garden makes some pretty mean steamed crab meat pork buns ($6 75)  crab meat pork buns  they offer a regular pork option  in fact  they give it away when you use their yelp promotion or spend a certain dollar amount  their pork version is so poorly made that they're better off removing it from their menu  i think they carelessly mass produce a bunch in the morning because they know they will be handing them out for free the steamed crab meat pork bun version is vastly better  the smooth skin that enfolds the soup and meat is delightfully thin  there's a decent amount of crab flavor blended with the pork and the soup is rather tasty finally  we get to the soup filled bun ($2 99)  this menu item made shanghai you garden popular with 5 year olds all the way to 98 year olds  this single item spread throughout instagram  facebook  and word of mouth because of its "innovative" redesign of the millennium old soup dumpling  it definitely made shanghai you garden successful based purely on its customers and publicity  but its success ends there this dish disappointed me more than the complete and utter failure of the batman vs  superman movie  the soup filled bun at shanghai you garden was absolute  without a doubt  trash  i wish i had a trashcan so i could hurl it in there and shout  "this is fucking vile " i saw two grandmas eat this and whisper in mandarin  "this tastes bad " grannies  this dish is worse than bad  it's utter horse shit it's literally meatless oily soup (the exact same soup from the regular soup dumplings) inside a large  tough  thick dough enclosure  if you are unfortunate enough to order this  you will be drinking 40% oil and choking down this stale dry excuse for edible flour  in fact  you're better off burning the $3 because then you'll at least witness something cool 
cuisine  6service  5decor  7value  5overall  6being from shanghai  my family had high hopes for this restaurant  walking into the dining room  it sure looks good  but the food and service left us wishing for more their best item is the soup dumplings  especially the aromatic crab & pork version  it is definitely one of the better ones in flushing  however  almost everything else was just okay  service was average  and nothing special enough that made me want to come back regularly  i guess i would every once in a while for the soup dumplings since they are one of the only places open for breakfast early 
last year  my boyfriend  friends  and i came here for a friend's birthday dinner  the restaurant is relatively new with beautiful asian artsy decor  the restaurant is fairly clean and the ceiling is hung with chinese calligraphy and the walls have a chinese floral design with chinese paintings hung on the wall as well i made reservations for 8pm  but the restaurant would not sit us down until everyone arrived  while we were waiting for the arrival of some friends  the waiter in the restaurant was willing to take down our orders so at least the food would be ready when we sat down  it can get crowded here easily  so best to come early and or make reservations my friends ordered chicken in wine sauce  cold beef tendon  and spicy beef tripe  i've never been a fan of chicken bathed in wine sauce  the cold beef tendon was delicious and had a bit of a sesame taste to it  the spicy beef tripe was okay  but not something i would normally eat we ordered a dish of crispy noodle with beef  it was absolutely delicious! my only complaint is that the noodles didn't have a crunchy texture  i was looking for that golden brown and crunchy bite  but it wasn't there  i ordered the rice cake with shredded pork & preserved mustard  this is a must have whenever i go to shanghainese restaurant  this was amazing  but the only complaint here was the portion size  it was quite small and we finished the dish in minutes we weren't full from the dishes we ordered so we actually ordered additional items  but i didn't have a chance to take pictures steamed pork buns & steamed pork and crab buns   these were amazing! i was never a huge fan of the steamed pork and crab buns at another restaurant i've been to with my boyfriend  but amazingly these were delicious steamed soy milk   i haven't had steamed soy milk since i was a child  it brought back a lot of memories  i was super happy and excited about having this  i thought it was interesting that it was served in a plate rice cake with beef   we ordered an additional entree as we weren't full from the dishes we had earlier  the beef version was okay  but i prefer my shredded pork and preserved mustard rice cake overall  we had a good experience  food was definitely a lot better than some of the shanghainese restaurants i've been to  service was good  but the only issue is that most of the staff speaks mandarin and my boyfriend and i don't understand the dialect   i would definitely return to this restaurant again just an fyi most of the staff don't speak english except for one or two staff members  this is also a cash only restaurant 
love the dumplings  they even have a super size dumpling   juicy!  the offer a free item with a certain purchase amount   you have to check with the wait staff for the deal   atmosphere is very welcoming!
2 5 stars**came here with the husband on a lunch date on a rainy tuesday  shared a table with 2 other asian people   disliked them staring at us eat and talking about us next to us lol the food was just mediocre  nothing special or outstanding  maybe we did not order the popular dishes?the shanghai noodle did not have enough "wok hay"  it tasted as if they only added soy sauce and mixed it in the noodle  don't recommend ordered 2 steamed buns  1 just pork and another a pork and crab meat combo  then i checked into yelp and realized you get a steamed pork bun for free on orders over $10  which is automatically discounted  no showing of the yelp check in needed  the skin was good and thin  but the meat was slightly bland and dried  very rough tasting  the soup was not steamy hot  the way we like it maybe the only good we found was the free pork bun deal  and also the quickness of the food coming out of the kitchen since we were hungry will not return ps  they kindly give you a bag for your wet umbrella upon entering the restaurant 
went to see lady gaga at citi field  well  flushing has a bustling chinatown  googled best cheap chinese near me & this pop up  read some of the reviews and we decided to take a walk  yes  walk  the place is only 1 2 miles away from citi field or you can take the subway from citi field to main st flushing  one stop we arrived at about 6 30pm  oops  the place was packed  there were people outside  inside waiting to be seated  the hostess told us there was a 15 minute wait  we decided to stay  we were not sure if that would be the case but we were seated in about 15 minutes the menu  in four languages chinese  english  korean & spanish plus photos of each dish  as soon as we were seated teapot of hot tea arrived  after another 10 to 15 minutes we decided on three dishes  shanghai special chicken  steamed snowleaf with shrimp dumpling  pan fried noodle with shredded pork and two beers the first to arrive was the chicken  half a breast with skin on  don't know what they do that chicken but it was deeeeeelisious! moist  tender   yum  next  came the noodles  also yum  in the meantime a serving of dumplings arrived but not the one's we ordered  we told our waiter that those are not what we ordered   he  complimentary on the house  six pork soup dumplings & they were deeeelisious  finally our dumpling arrived  by this time wife and i were full  had the leftovers packed  and last but not least complimentary dessert of congee or sweet soybean curd arrived now for the bill  all of this came to   drumroll please   $30 including tax  two beers  the most expensive dish on the menu is duck soup at $29 99 but that is for four or more people  i would venture to say 85% of the menu items are under $10  the cheapest is millet rice cake at $1 25 so if you're heading out to citi field for a game  concert or any event & don't want to spend an arm and a leg of stadium fast food take a walk or subway to main st  flushing  i guarantee you  you will no be disappointed oh i did forget to mention this is better then joe's shanghai or ginger 
you best get yourself over here before shanghai you garden gets any more popular  their soup dumplings  nay shanghainese foods are some of the best nyc has to offer  the rumor is that the head chef migrated from nan xiang to shanghai you garden  leading to an influx of xiao long bao enthusiasts  tourists  and garden gnomes  the interior of the restaurant is a bit nicer than typical chinese restaurants  they also had a slickdeal at the time i went  spend $10 and get an order of xlb for free 
this place is awesome! they give you a free order of xlb if you spend over $10 which is easy if you come with 2 or more people  the xlb is delicious   flavorful  and juicy  i also got the large xlb they advertise outside that you drink with a straw  but that was underwhelming  just a bond broth in a glorified bowl  other favorites on the menu also include the dofu hua (tofu pudding)  soy milk  and scallion pancakes  the scallion pancake with beef is also a must   crispy  flaky and flavorful 
the best thing to order here is soup dumplings  definitely pretty authentic  ) the other dim sum dishes were mediocre so i wouldn't come here just to get dim sum  i will come back for brunch again most likely  keep in mind of the long wait time during weekend peak times 
i like this one better than nan xiang because they have better service and also offer one free steam dumpling per table  however  their food is on the salty side 
** free order of soup dumplings when your bill goes over $10 **** cash only **i came here with a party of 10 for a birthday celebration and as long as you arrive early enough there shouldn't be a long wait  their soup dumplings  in my opinion  is good and i do find them delicious  but i think the shanghainese xlb on prince street prepares them better  their actual entrée and side dishes are bomb com here  we must of had 10 different dishes  aside from the soup dumplings  and everything tasted so good! i would avoid ordering the large soup dumpling since i've heard reviews that it's pretty unimpressive in taste flavor  unless you're just doing it for the 'gram 
in all honestly  i just came here for the soup dumplings  when they offer to give a free order of soup dumplings because the wait is long  my thoughts are that it is too good to be true or i am going to be a bit let down  who gives away free orders of their best dish? their soup dumplings are pretty good  some ppl gets the crab pork dumpling (yellow thing on the dumpling in case you didn't know how to tell it apart)  i stay with the pure pork dumplings mainly because i can't taste the difference  it holds its own in flavor with other restaurants in flushing and nyc  it won't wow me  but it will definitely won't disappoint either  soup dumpling is nostalgia at this point in my life  it's a perfectly bite size of delicious happiness  their other food that i ordered were okay  croaker and pan fried noodles  overall  the food is not bad  but i am not sure i am willing to wait for my next visit  the wait varies depending on group size and is usually between 15min 1 hour 
shanghai you garden haiku first xiao long bao free! steamed vegetable dumpling good! food come fast and hotate here twice in 2 days  and think i've hate enough of my xlb fill for this month  i really like that the first xlb batch is free! i will admit the soup is fatty and a little dull on taste  but the skin is thin enough and soft  the vegetable steamed dumplings seem to be a hit with everyone i bring here  and the nian gao is a must have to go with the oily xlb 
first time here on a tuesday at 6 30pm and still had a very short wait  not sure if it's popularity came from every table getting a free order of xiaolong bao (soup dumplings) which tasted pretty good  i came mainly to try the soup filled bun where you drink the crab soup through a straw  it looked adorable but was disappointed with the fishy taste  also got the scallion pancake with beef  salty soy bean curd  cucumbers and garlic and wonton with hot oil  they were all okay but the cucumber was kind of bland  overall the decor  utensils and service was nice so i guess i'll still come back to try their other dishes
my family's go to spot for shanghainese cuisine   really good   and i really appreciate that they have youtiao and sweet soy milk 
really tasty and great bang for your buck! there were three of us and we got 8 or 9 plates to share   lots of food and came out to about $12 person  our favorite dishes were the spicy wontons and ribs (fell right off the bone!)  i really liked how they gave us to go menus and were able to take our orders outside while we waited for a table  we barely had to wait when we were seated 
my quest for nycs best soup dumplings led me to flushing  a friend recommended shanghai you garden to me  advising i try out the xxl soup filled bun we arrived around 1 30pm on a sunday afternoon and this place was popping off! all the tables were full with both large and small groups all tucking in to a feast of various dishes  naturally i started to re think my flushing dumpling tour (aka dump tour 2017) and order everything on the menu! it all looked great  but for the sake of reserving our stomachs for later we got the scallion pancake with beef (recommended by the lady sat next to us)  two large soup filled buns and to our delight as we spent over $10 we were given a free portion of the pork soup dumplings   what a deal! scallion pancake with beef was real tasty  the only thing i would say is that the pancake was a little too thick for the amount of beef but the flavor combo was spot on the pork soup dumplings were up there with some of the best  a very solid soup dumpling the large soup filled bun     meh  i didn't particularly enjoy the flavor of the soup inside and to be honest i couldn't even confidently say what flavor it was  also the bun it's self was very stodgy  i'm glad i tried it but can confirm  it sucks given how good the other food that we saw coming out cooked  i feel that a big sunday lunch with a group of friends is next on the cards here  good food at a good price    will be back!
it's get super busy so prepare to wait  the mini dumplings are so delicious! i enjoyed drinking the giant dumpling soup out of a straw   service was a tad bit slow  but the food made up for it 
great spot! this place is very organized and has you seating with your order within minutes  at the entrance a women takes your party number and gives you a time and also hands you a menu  then a waiter takes orders from the wait line 3 minutes after we sat down we were serve our dishes if you like soy milk the sweet soy milk is a must! taste very fresh and homemade the xlb is good as well  thin skin with a chewy texture don't forget to check in for the free  bun that you slurp with a straw 
our family comes here a lot and i will have to say the flavoring of the food and quality of the food has slowly gone down each time we visit the very first two times we went it was amazing  we were blown away how delicious the dishes were  everything was flavorful  not too salty  just the way our family likes it but the past two times we have visited  the prices has definitely gone up  but that's fine as long as the food is amazing  but we felt that the flavoring of things just were as good as it were the first few times we went not sure if they changed chefs  but we haven't gone there for a while now  hopefully we will go back again and hope they still taste as great as it was when we first went 
this restaurant is so delicious!! the service is great and the price is right! i would recommend the soup dumplings  green sticky rice balls  fried hong kong bread  and much more  you can sit down and eat and the line goes really quickly  i would go here any day!
the location has a big affect  it's located at a shady place; however what you find inside is truly what you would call a hidden gem  beautiful interior  well dressed employees  they all speak mandarin  i believe the manager took our order which made it a plus i can't go through all the food so generally  i would have to say this was the best "dimsum" i've had  the free soup dumplings was a plus  not the best soup dumplings  but that was already expected  as for everything else  very well made and seasoned impressively  +2 starsthe service was impeccable  even though i couldn't speak mandarin  the server explained everything and recommended choices without feeling disturbed  all in all  great service  +2 starswas it a journey? it did impress me  but not there yet  definitely find this gem of a place  don't get scared by the surroundings 
advice for first comers  it's cash only  and absolutely do not order the large soup dumpling!came around 5 6 pm and there was no wait  i liked seeing the cooks make the dumplings behind a glass wall as i walked into the restaurant as it gives you a sense of freshness  all the employees seemed to be shanghainese so i guess that also gives you a sense of authenticity  things ordered  har gao (shrimp dumplings)  pork soup dumplings  and crab and pork soup dumplings  the food came out relatively quickly  all the dumplings were plump with meat and full of flavor  in fact  the har gao had 2 whole pieces of juicy shrimp  and i didn't have to dig for the meat when i bit into the soup dumplings  there's quite a bit of pork inside  but the crab and pork dumplings were a bit on the oily side  they were flavorful  but i think the crab meat was oily because the pork only dumplings weren't oily at all  being highly curious about the large soup bun that's advertised  it was added to the order  i should've been suspicious of it when the waiter said "maybe" when asked if the large soup dumpling was any good    it turned out to be a complete waste of $3  i wish they would've charged more for it and provided a better tasting soup bun! the bun had no meat what so ever  and the soup inside it lacked any good flavor! it literally tasted like thin soup that had yet to develop any flavor  i was really disappointed the broth in it didn't taste remotely close to the broth in the regular soup dumplings  i actually prefer this place to joe's shanghai  the dumplings are more flavorful rather than just salt seasoning  would definitely come here again!
this place has delicious pork & crab meat soup dumplings and great service  the overall environment is clean and all the other food options  including the stir fried udon and rice cakes are pretty great too  had to wait quite a bit for my soup dumplings  but i was glad with my overall experience  i will definitely come again  )
this small storefront restaurant nestled in the busy section of downtown flushing turned out to be a wonderful gem!the restaurant turned out to be "deep" and was bigger than how it seemed from the street  the tables were good sized  able to accommodate multiple delicacies one could possibly ingest!everything tasted really good! that's a rare find for me we ordered  shanghai special chicken that looked like hainanese chicken  but with the most delicious sauce chinese vegetable with bean curd   something i usually steer clear of  but this finely chopped dish was so delicious that i put in another order for take out sauteed tofu with salted preserved egg yolk & shrimp had the soft  silken tofu in delicious preserved duck yolk sauce rice cake with salted egg that has the most delicious combination of dried ground pork and duck yolk encased in green mochi fried loofah soy bean with gluten was refreshing and no bitter taste from the loofah at all bean & pig hoof soup was reported by my eating companion as most delicious   she is a connoisseur of delectable foods  as is an expert culinary home chef  so i totally take her word for it!the waiter brought us complimentary steam buns   ) which tasted fine (i still hold out for kung fu xiao long bao on this one) the bill was really small for all of this most delicious food!when i bragged about the restaurant to others  a colleague of mine recommended trying scallion pancake with sliced beef   she said the pancake is deliciously crispy i can't wait to go back to try more delicious dishes!
this is one of my favorite places to go to for soup dumplings  they have a great selection of food and it's always nice to receive an extra order of soup dumplings after ordering more than $10  some dishes i can recommend are the sweet and sour fried fish  pan fired pork soup dumplings  wonton soup and noodles  however  when you go  be ready to wait in line since this place is incredibly popular 
i love the soup dumplings here and the service is great  they give free soup dumplings if you spend at least $10 which is on the yelp check in offer  today i got the wine chicken  scallion pancake with some meat  and an iced soy milk  with that they gave me free soup dumplings  loved it 
have i really not written a review for this place yet?! i feel like i come here at least once a month or two  according to yelp  8 times already first things first  1) come early  every time i come here  every table is usually filled and i have to wait  the longest i've waited was 15 20 minutes which wasn't too bad 2) cash only  3) check in on yelp and get complimentary steam pork buns  sometimes they let you redeem for pork soup dumplings instead ok! now that you've settle down here is my typical order  deep fried yellow croaker with dried seaweed   you're probably wondering what the heck is this dish  if you like fish  this is your dish  i don't know any other restaurant in flushing that serves this so give it a shot  it's a seasonably well fried fish  it is a tad greasy so beware xlb   crab & pork meat   this is my favorite of the two they offer  i like how their dumpling skin is thin and you get more meat inside  turnip puff   usually a breakfast delicacy  but you can order for dinner too  love the wholesome heartiness of this noodle soup   generally speaking  it is huge  i think it's meant to be shared family style  very generous with the noodles pan fried u don noodles   very good  flavorfulon my to try list rice cake with beefbig soup dumpling with straw (new!)at the end  they may or may not serve you complimentary rice wine ball soup  i believe the chinese dessert is called "jiu niang"  it's basically tang yuan  glutinous balls  floating in fermented rice wine  i was pretty sad yesterday they didn't give us any  if you never had it before  it's definitely an acquired taste  most of the time i just pick out the glutinous balls and eat that  so gooood well  i guess see you next month shanghai you garden!
nice spot to go on a weekday to avoid the crowds   it is tuck away in prince st   i have to say the big crab soup dumpling is really great to drink   super hot and don't eat the skin   it is extra thick to compensate the soup  i think its order 10 bucks or more you get an extra set of soup dumplings for free!  i haven't tried everything yet  but you won't be disappointed 
worth the long wait on mother's day complaints  turnip puffs were cold in the middle but they gave us a fresh order after we let them know  the giant xiao long bao were way too crabby fish for me  really good stuff  kung pao eel  regular xiao long bao (2 orders for free)  snow pea leaves  chinese vegetables and beancurd  watercress dumplings  wifi 
delicious! the soup dumplings were just the right amount of meat & skin ratio and it never broke while picking it up  the soup was delicious and it came out pipping hot which i love! short wait but they're efficient about it    waiter takes your order while you wait for a table  they even charged my phone for me while we ate  so thankful!
shanghai you garden is worth the long trek to flushing  queens  this has been one of my favorite shanghainese dining experiences in nyc  the restaurant is very busy so expect a wait to get seated  efficiently  they have you place your order while you wait  so the food comes out right away once you're at your table  excellent authentic dishes  generous portions  and affordable prices  we ordered 10 dishes and the total bill came out to be only $66  it fed 5 of us with plenty of leftovers  and to top it off  the restaurant gives complimentary soup dumplings and dessert the service was very attentive and the restaurant had nice seating  don't forget  cash only!
i was in flushing staying with my family and was craving soup dumplings  i hardly get out and eat chinese food on my own  partially because i'm lazy and partially because there's something about chinese food where it's always better with a crowd  and honestly  the soup dumplings in sf are overpriced and whatever  came in on a friday morning  just around 11am or so  we were seated right away and it was hardly packed  ) of course  had to order the giant soup dumpling! we also got the regular xiao long bao as well (free with check in!) and some other small plates (savory tofu pudding  soy sauce chicken  and the scallion pancakes with beef!)the giant soup dumpling wasn't bad     but very thick skin (of course) and no meat (or just like small tufts of it)  be careful  you will burn your mouth if you don't wait a little  i much preferred the smaller dumplings and if i could go back  i would definitely get that instead next time  the scallion pancake   the scallion pancake  the dough was perfect  the seasoning was perfect  this was the best scallion pancake i've ever had period  done recommend! good cheap eats for the win  flushing has the best places to go  and this one did not disappoint  d
super busy  which means that the food is good and we were not disappointed! the wait is actually not that bad  the food is great  all of them individually doesn't cost much  but it all adds up! so beware because everything looks sooo good! we got 5 things at it came out to be $58 ish (before tax) 
if you have an xiao long bao (xlb) aka soup dumpling craving  this is one of the go to places  chinese breakfast (soy milk and egg pancakes) and great options for lunch and dinner make this place busy most times   the design and decor is wonderful  and as told by one of the managers  an interior designer was hired to give that higher end feel   the restaurant is in the middle of a three different billion dollar developments where units sell in the $1 200+ p sq ft range and the street it self (which used to be more disheveled and somewhat dicey seems poised to redevelop  it can get crowded walking there and in the restaurant   the booths are more spacious than the open tables  however you get to watch the chefs hand make the dumplings while you wait for a seat and if you have room you can do a xlb tour by going to the other popular xlb restaurants only 2 3 blocks away    i think a xlb showdown is due 
do you have a soft spot for the pretense of authenticity?  there are restaurants out there claiming to bring old school flavors back  whatever the heck that means   take for instance  the ridiculously long wait outside of tim ho wan's new east village outlet  which was supposed to call forth the flavors of modern hong kong   there's also you garden   they are so confident of their shanghai soup dumpling tradecraft they are willing to give away products for free to generate buzz   what's their deal?you garden is named after yu garden 豫園  a classical garden next to the city god temple 城隍廟 within the old core of shanghai   next to the temple there is a famous eatery that lays down the very benchmark for soup dumplings    nan xiang bun shop 南翔饅頭店   have you had a good one?  probably not until you had a steamer or 2 of the stuff at nan xiang   someone in flushing already cribbed the name  so i guess someone else could crib the neighborhood landmark   the natural question to ask is   are they the american version of nan xiang?  no   you can't really expect it to be just like the original   even if they are able to import everything and the labor  local minutae will still make it slightly different   however  they do compare well to its in town rivals in terms of decor  it's chinese contemporary   the seating is shared tables with strangers  but a bit less spartan than the usual   that being said  it's oddly  discordian with takeout counters  cramped and with disturbingly untidy downstairs restrooms   service is typically chinese  brusque and to the point   hungry?  whaddadyawant?  okay  thanks   how about the food?  in terms of the soup dumplings  i would say that you garden did a decent job   the skin is the thin and gluten driven variety and stands up well to the chopsticks   amazingly  it does not stick to each other even when overlapped  which requires some tradecraft in dough prep   the soup within is well composed  not too greasy  not too thin  and served piping hot  which is the way it's supposed to    now  what about the other stuff?  the stir fried thick noodles (or udon in the menu) has the right combination of vinegary kicks and salty hits along with the uctuous mouthfeel   the soy milk is served piping hot in a bowl without any weird cross contamination of flavors (which happens with alarming regularity in flushing)  just a very clean  slightly sweet and thin soy milk  which shows you the care taken   the shanghai style wonton soup base is made with thin strips of fried egg  dried baby shrimp 蝦皮 and seaweed  海苔 which is quite authentic  as i can attest eating a few of my shanghaiese ex girlfriend's family meals   the wonton is the looser cabbage and pork variety with the thicker white skin  which is different from the cantonese egg based variety with shrimp and pork fillings okay  to wrap it up  it's not as good as my experiences in shanghai or taipei  but it's good as an american proprietor of soup dumplings   sure  why not   we can use another good place for that 
shanghai you garden sells authentic shanghainese food  i'm shanghainese so i know they put sugar in almost everything  also  the waiters and waitresses all speak shanghainese  you can't get more authentic than that  )the food was great  my bf and i got the grandma beef thing with quail eggs  we also got xiao long bao with crab meat and the regular one  we tried their big soup dumplings which is just soup in dough and you drink it with a straw  we also got a tofu like dish and tripe  personally  i don't like my food to be very sweet  growing up as a kid  my dad had diabetes so we curbed the sugar and always added salt instead  though i know this is what true shanghainese food is like  i'd probably still eat the modified version of the food cause i like salt more than sugar lol  all in all  i like this place for the authenticity  ambience of the place  and the food though some were sweeter than i liked  they also ended our night with a sweet rice ball soup 
tiny place with extremely long and slow wait   and it's not because it's that particularly busy  but it has very limited space and not very efficient   and the hostess was very pushy getting us to order while we're waiting   she was basically naming every dish on the menu and ask if we want it   also  we even made a reservation  which meant absolutely nothing   we had to wait outside with my baby and they couldn't care less about us   we only came here because i saw strictly dumpling's youtube review   but i think because of that  this place has become a tourist trap  which is no better than nan xiang xiao long bao   so disappointing   
my family and i come here a lot and usually have a good time  lately  when we order some fried stinky tofu  they really skimp on the side vegetables (pickled cabbaged) that pair with the tofu  there are probably a few slices of cabbage to about 15 pieces of tofu  and whem we ask for a bit more they said they only give what the order comes with  i understand this place has gotten super busy and popular lately but either you give enough cabbage to pair with the tofu or don't offer any at all  disappointing in that aspect  but  the food is generally good  like the soup dumplings  rice cakes  and fried noodles

the xaiolongbao soup dumplings here are very good  so good that we ordered seconds  it was definitely worth the 15min wait to get a table  we had the shredded pork & preserved vegetable noodle soup  shredded pork and salted cabbage noodle soup and pan fried noodle with shredded chicken as well and they are all very good 
the dumplings were delicious! they steamed and pan fried soup dumplings  the steamed are better the pan fried is more of a bun consistency  they have the big fluffy scallion pancakes! yummm  glad i found this place! the service was just ok 
nice place with great deals free aoup woth $10 dine in purchase  the wait time is about 16 29 monutes dpending time you arrive   amy way you can order your food in advance and wait for you food on your table good service polite people  you may have understanding problem but its ok they will work outits a nice spot to eat out with friends and family
this is by far one of my favorite places for xiao long baos (soup dumplings) in all of flushing  my go to spot has always been the restaurant on prince street  but this place taste so much better! the entrance of the restaurant looks like a little "hole in the wall" type of restaurant  but once you go in  it's much bigger than it looks like from the outside! i went there at around 1pm on a weekday and there was a short wait  around 5 10 minutes  but they offer plenty of seats while waiting  the one thing that drew me in was the free order of soup dumplings with a purchase of $10 or more (free stuff is always a win win!)  they were delicious  and did not taste too oily like the ones in joe's shanghai   i also ordered turnip puffs  rice cake with shredded pork  and chicken with wine sauce  the rice cake tasted a little bland to me and it would have been better if it had more taste  however  the chicken with wine sauce tasted very flavorful and delicious  so i highly recommend it!another plus is that the bathroom was clean! (it's pretty hard to come across in flushing)overall  i was very pleased with the food and i highly recommend this place if you're craving for some soup dumplings!
this restaurant does deserve the mixed reviews it has received from yelpers  this review contains a lot of loosely translated items from mandarin to english  food  allow me to start off with the good stuff  i recommend scallion pancake with beef  "snow vegetable" with meat noodles in soup  "vegetable fried rice " which is  of course  fried with fatty pork bits  vegetable steamed dumplings  the cold spicy beef appetizer  and the red bean paste pastry  the mediocre items include  the free xiao long bao that come with every meal over $10  the fried pork ribs (more on this issue later)  and the soy milk  the issue with the xiao long bao ("soup dumplings") were that the dough used to wrap around the pork is a bit too thick and hard  i believe kung fu xiao long bao does it better  the issue with the fried pork ribs was that we had discovered that they were under cooked! we also found an ant in our soy milk  but upon further reflection  it more than likely got in there somehow after it was served  service  the people are generally quite responsive  however  there is a feeling that they were trying to get us to leave immediately at the end of the meal  although understandable  my only tip for everyone to avoid this situation is   please do not come on weekends after  say  11 30 a m decor  interior is interesting and surprisingly large  to say the least  there is an issue with the chair being way too short for the table  but i'm a bit taller than many  and had no issues  i'm a little bit nervous about the fact that the kitchen is in the basement  with people who appear to be walking into and out of it for a smoking break every few minutes  note  cash only tip  read the signs outside carefully before parking  i recommend the garage across the street from the park on the same side of the restaurant that has vehicle elevators  parking there has been safe for me so far and relatively hassle free 
i've known about this place when it had lower double digit reviews and have always wanted to come here because   umm  free xiao long baos?! yes  i am there  (ps  if you don't do the yelp check in  i think the xiao long baos are free if you purchase over $10   but i'm not sure if you need a yelp check in and spend over $10)  i also am not sure if this place is affiliated with corner 28 because when i asked for a take out container  they gave me a bag that said corner 28  anyways  this is getting off topic and i'm sure you're more interested in hearing about the actual restaurant it's on 40th road which is one of the shadier roads in flushing for me  neighbored by an alcohol shop  massage place ($20 for 60 minute back rub   hm  i need to check that place out on yelp)  across the street from corner 28  and relatively close to a park  the exterior definitely does not compare to the inside which is extremely clean  spacious  and well light  it gives off a very nice ambiance   fairly reminiscent of nan xiang xiao long bao (i know a lot of people compare this place to that place    i mean why not? they serve the same food)  this place is definitely an upgrade though  because it's new   has booths and is way more suitable for larger groups than nan xiang is  the food is slightly more expensive  but you would have to pay that 5% premium for the larger and more spacious environment the workers here wear a cute little ancient china outfit  can't describe it but i always think it's neat when workers actually have a uniform  they are also extremely nice  not sure if they could speak english though  they also give you a free pudding dessert at the end of every meal  i didn't try it but i heard it was very healthy and delicious  the xiao long baos are excellent! honestly  i could not taste the difference between nan xiang and this place   though i wish i could've tried the crab xiao long baos  as they are my favorite opposed to the pork ones (didn't get a chance to look at the menu so i honestly don't even know if they have it) they have this singular large soup dumpling that you can drink with a straw for $2 99 which i thought was pretty awesome  i didn't get to try it tonight but i will definitely come back to try it! this place is cash only  no surprise there  and please  do not try to find parking in the area   or pay for parking at the parking lot in skyview or across from queens crossing my meal here was kind of rushed  a result of my own late arrival   but i will definitely update my review once i come back to try those personal soup dumplings!
long lines especially on the weekends but it's worth the wait  xlb are tasty  brothy with the perfect amount of wrapped dough  highly recommend their beef scallion pancake as well as their fried spare ribs!
service isn't great  but the food is good if you spend over $10  you get a complementary set of pork soup dumplings 
best dumplings ever! always busy in there and they give you a free pork dumpling with any order   they are great and very quick! love it here  )
the crab and pork xlb were good here  both my hubby and i actually liked them! (he likes joe shanghai's  i prefer nan xiang ) went there recently with the kids for brunch  the big booths were roomy and allowed the kids to be dufus like and not mash into us the whole time we ordered quite a few items savory silken tofu   really good (reminded me of the ingredients used at white bear's spicy wontons)shanghai udon noodles   meh  too oily but the kids liked them for their heft *pickled veg & pork soup noodles   big serving and the kids liked the noodles  too  the broth was mild and wasn't greasy wuxi spare ribs   fall off the bone tender  didn't need the flimsy steak knife  good flavor but a little too gloppy   too much cornstarch in the sauce  steamed veg dumplings   good flavor from the garlic chives and spinach  hubby thought it tasted like grass  the service was mediocre  it's gone downhill since it first opened and they're less worried about pleasing and fawning over the customers (maybe since their nytimes or time out ny reviews ) the bathrooms were a mess and the mens vs  the womens bathrooms are in vastly different locations (tough for a mom who has boys )all in all   we'll definitely go back for the crab xlb  tofu and noodles 
bad experience! recommend nan xiang xiao long bao  the foods are more flavorful than this place 
edit   they have the giant soup dumplings here too!shanghai you garden is everything good about nan xiang without any of the bad parts  i am the biggest fan of this place and their xiao long baos  even better  the restaurant is currently an deal of a free order of xlbs with every order over $10  it's a great chance to try their signature dish  although i'm sure you'll be ordering more just an fyi  it is tucked away a bit from main street towards the lirr stop i'm not sure of the affiliation between this place with nan xiang (almost identical menu and flavors) or corner 28 (uses their plastic bags and some workers have jackets with their logo)  but i'm not complaining at all  the xlbs are deliciously filled with lots of broth and meat and the skins are thin enough that you can see the amount of soup inside!  the handmade pork dumplings are also great and chive y and offer a bit of a different texture  an unexpected winner was their noodle with beef and chili oil  the beef is tender and noodles with chili oil are just the right amount of spicy and savory  the restaurant itself is also beautifully spacious  renovated and clean  shanghai you garden deserves 5 5 stars and i will definitely be back with friends and family 
i absolutely love this place  if you go on a weekend  be prepared to wait for a table  so many people love the yummy soup dumplings they serve and they won't seat you until everyone in your party is there  but i say it's worth the wait  the food is really good and they offer a deal that if you order comes out to $10 or more you get one free order of soup dumplings  the soup dumplings surprisingly comes very fast after you order so that's always a plus  besides soup dumplings they have a very big menu to pick from  there's soups  cold dishes  noodles  breakfast menu with soy milk and they're all really good service is good and they have plenty of servers that are working so all customers are taken cared of and not have to wait long  oh  and last but not least they're a cash only establishment so be sure to stop at the atm beforehand  but even if you forget that's alright  they actually have an atm in the restaurant right next to the front counter 
with so many options for food to choose from in flushing  i think shanghai you is an option you wont regret  the food here is very flavorful and depending on the time of day you come  the wait could be quick or long  my friend did most of the ordering so i'm not sure of the names of the dishes but we got scallion pancake with meat  crab soup dumplings  pork soup dumplings  bean curd cold dish  tripe and meat cold dish  grandmas pork rib? and the large meat balls most of the dishes were flavorful and the meat was very tender  overall  i would definitely recommend this place 
the only up point i see of this restaurant is cleanliness and quite well decored compared to other chinese places in flushing  my friend wanted to try this place cause she thought it was dimsum  like catering dimsum  but it actually serves small sized shanghai dishes the menu kinda looks like joe's shanghai with the highlight of xiao long bao  personally i like the soup dumpling here a bit more than joe's  the stuffing was the same flavor but the bao skin was chewier  we ordered two crabmeat xiao long bao and got a complimentary pork bao with a check in on yelp (yelp for life!)  asides from that  other dishes were quite disappointing  the shanghai special chicken was actually haianese chicken and was a bit lack of flavor  the chicken feet in white wine was weird to me cause it tasted like chocolate lol  we also ordered this hugee bowl of pork feet soup with bamboo and it was really bland  there were these huge meatballs in sauce that came well with white rice but nothing special price was cheap  ranging from $5 $10 per dish as i remember  overall the xiao long bao wasn't good enough to make up for other dishes so i probably won't come back 
amazing  day or night is busy but for good reason! always wait maybe 5 minutes for a table but always so worth it  service quality  service speed  service efficiency all great  food quality  menu choices  menu prices  all wonderful  plus free xiao long bao! interior always gives perfect atmosphere 
we ordered too much food  i was really expecting that the popularity of this place would have kept us waiting much longer than 20 minutes on a sunday night  we put our names in  and wandered over to tous les jours to have some very disappointing savory pastries  when we returned 15 minutes later  we were seated within 5 minutes  as expected we ordered four dishes    the crab soup dumplings  beef tendon  soy beans with cabbage and bean curd  and pan fried pork buns  they warned us that the pan fried pork buns had a long wait time because things were a little backed up in the kitchen    around 40 minutes  but those are a favorite of mine  so i insisted  they gave us a free order of pork soup dumplings to compensate for the wait  i can't really complain the cold beef tendon appetizer is precisely what you'd expect    it's comparable to what you would get at any other place serving this same dish  the soy bean dish is one of the cheaper vegetable dishes that they offer  and it's also as expected  the crab soup dumplings are incredibly crabby  and the skins are rather sturdy  we had not a single one burst or leak before we finished them all  they are full of delightful soup  and the meat is excellent as well  the free pork soup dumplings were a little less sturdy  and a few of those burst  but i can't say that didn't happen because they sat a little longer  since we ate them after the crab ones  i can't complain too much because they were free the fried pork buns are excellent  these are better than my favorite ones at shanghai café deluxe in manhattan chinatown  because the dough is a little more tender  and less dough y  the bottoms are crispy  and the whole thing is still a little oily  but less so than the ones with shanghai café they also serve a dessert  which is a fermented rice dessert that resembles korean makkeoli in flavor  i wasn't a huge fan  but again  it comes with the meal  so i can't complain too much we ended up paying $29 before tip and we ended up waddling our way out from eating way too much food  i would happily come back here 
forgot how many dishes i ordered  but the free 小籠包 was the only one i would give a positive review  everything else was just     fair  good for them that although it's frxxking busy at peak hour  place was still clean 
this place is amazing!!! big portion  nice food  reasonable price   this is the place to be for a nice breakfast  lunch or dinner  the pork buns filled with soup just burst out of flavor  the noodles are very nice  and the scallion pancakes are superb! instead of the normal plain pancakes  a little bit of bbq meat was added to enhance the flavor even more  hot tea was waiting for us at the resraurant  and the waiters were very nice and efficient  even if they spoke more fluent in chinese rather than english   but then it's a given in chinatown already  i've been here twice  and i would definitely go here a third time!
the most delicious shangainese food i've ever tasted  my family and i went here for a nice mother's day dinner and although the wait was an hour it was well worth it  however i did notice that later in the night the wait for tables did lessen significantly  compared with the outside the inside was not what i expected  the decor is so lovely and unique i can't wait to come back here again!
for a quintessentially hidden gem in flushing chinatown  shanghai you garden features a menu full of shanghai delicacies that represents the jewel of asia  if i were to lie  i would tell you how everything on the menu was average  however the truth is everything was fantastic  in fact between two grown adults we finished enough food for four people in one sitting because it was that good  my only mark off for this place is due to its xlbs  i remember it was ordinary and not wowingly amazing  however eveything else from lions head meatballs to pork knuckle was spot on 
this place is a ok  their steamed soup dumpling is the only thing good there  i ordered eel stir fried in hot oil  pan fried dumplings  the eel tasted not so fresh  the fried dumpling wasn't good either  if you want soup dumpling  then that's the place to go  if you want anything else  go elsewhere 
food is decent  nothing special  the wait is a little crazy on any given weekend evening   which i guess should be expected  the soup dumplings are pretty good  but everything else is just decent  on the plus side  the food comes out super duper fast  to the point where i found myself trying to eat everything before they whipped the food off the table 
i came here several times and each time i walked away with a happy belly  first thing you notice when you enter is the shop rite mat  yes  there's a shop rite mat by the entrance way my first visit here  they took our order before sitting down  it was extremely busy on a sunday afternoon  each time the service was impeccable  the pork soup dumplings were consistently better than the pork and crab soup dumplings  the skin is paper thin  but the dumpling is loaded with soup and meat  on the side  we got the cold cucumbers  crispy noodles with veggies  udon noodles with veggies (crispy wins)  different types of fried rice (which were alright)  and their braised pork belly dish it's hard to find great soup dumplings  it's even harder to find consistent soup dumplings  but you can find both at shanghai you 
tl;dr  the best cheap and affordable soup dumplingsit's amazing how far $18 gets you in flushing  i was bursting at the seams after that much food here and still got to try an amazing variety of foods  my lunch consisted of salty soy milk  2 baskets of soup dumplings (they're currently doing a promotion where you get a basket of soup dumplings for spending at least $10)  a scallion pancake  and a giant soup filled bun first off  don't bother with the giant soup filled bun  it's pretty much a novelty and the soup inside tastes rather bland with chunks of crab meat that i almost choked on  the bun itself is also flavorless other than that  the salty soy milk and scallion pancake were pretty standard fare  however  the soup dumplings were simply amazing  not only was the taste phenomenal  but this was the first time where i hadn't broken a single soup dumpling by accident lastly  i want to give props to how clean and organized this chinese restaurant is  which  sadly  is such a rarity 
not sure of this place relative to others in flushing but i thought it was great and all i could ask for from a chinese restaurant! it was so cheap and very good  we ordered two of the giant soup dumplings ($2 95 each) which were super cute but weird because there was no filling? it was literally just a crabby soup which is fine but not what i expected for sure  we also got the scallion pancake with beef in it and that was good and pretty much exactly as expected   very fried and there was enough scallion taste but the beef definitely covered it a little more than usual  we also got the fried pork buns which were so filling and so fried oily but very good  we were so pleasantly surprised by the free soup dumplings too  which were great! the total order for two people stuffed to the brim was only $17   but it is cash only! the interior is very nice but there did seem to be a long line when we left at 6pm so plan accordingly 
a couple months ago on facebook all i saw was the whole dumpling craze  you know the one where you drink the broth with a straw and then there's a big chunk of pork inside the rice cake covering it  lol  my husband's family is from new york and i believe it's here where the craze started  like many hyped things  this in my honest opinion is hyped  it's really wonton soup  lololololol  the broth is similar to wontons soup  the pork meat reminds me of the prob meat inside a wonton in wonton soup  it's just that it's a steamed dumpling  for the experience it's okay  really and honestly  nothing too special  the servers for this place is really a hit or miss  i know you worked all morning but please don't act like i made you have that attitude  ugh  rude chinese ladies really irk me  my mil is super passive so i try to be so she doesn't feel uncomfortable but if it wasn't for her i would've said really mean things  other dishes and food was good  will give this place another try  another time 
keep passing by this place whenever we are in the area and never realized what it really was! my husband is a dumpling fanatic! we ventured in one night for a late dinner  good decision! we were immediately seated with numerous smiles! our waiter was sooo friendly and helpful  especially because we don't eat pork  he literally pointed out all the things they were known for that didn't have pork! we ordered beef scallion pancakes  this sliced beef noodle dish  shrimp dumplings  veggie dumplings  and a red bean paste puff  it was all really good!! i can't say which was my favorite! i gave them 4 stars because to be known for dumplings  they didn't have a huge variety of different kinds   almost all their dumplings had some type of pork in it  ughhh!!!! other than that    we will definitely go back!
the poster advertising their super big soup dumpling lured us in  we walked into a surprisingly beautiful restaurant  we frequent this area of flushing and love the food  but the decor is usually a step above dumpster patio  not shanghai you  this restaurant is very nice!we ordered two of their colossal soup dumplings and an order of the steamed crab meat and pork buns  when the food came we (very pleasantly) found out that if you order over a certain amount you get a free order of the steamed pork buns  awesome!we were disappointed in the huge soup dumplings  there was not meat in them  just soup and the dumpling wrapper however  the crab and pork buns and the pork buns vaulted shanghai you garden into our top spot for soup dumplings  they had plenty of soup  plenty of meat and a whole lot of flavor  they also didn't fall apart as soon as you tried to pick them up  anyone who's eaten soup dumplings before knows that getting them onto the spoon un popped can be tricky  still tricky here  but not as bad as a lot of other places we've been shanghai you garden has been added to our flushing dumpling tour as a star!
i first heard about shanghai you garden earlier this year when it was the trending new restaurant in flushing  queens  my best friend and i had off from work on friday and decided to catch up and to have lunch here  we arrived at around 12 30pm and there was a line surprisingly  i thought that there would be less people here since it's the long holiday weekend and people would escape nyc early friday morning afternoon   p among the both of us  we shared the following 1) fried bean gluten [$5 75]   good  it's gluten with mushrooms  bamboo  and chinese lily flowers 2) pan fried pork buns [6 pieces  $6 50]   very good  i loved the texture of the soft doughy bun  there's a tiny bit of soup inside the pork buns too 3) pan fried pork & vegetable wontons [$5 50]   it was a bit oily  tastes good  but i wouldn't ordered it again tho 4) steam pork buns [6 pieces  this was free since we ordered more than $10 worth of food  you have to ask for it ]   very good  but  some of the soup dumplings were slightly stuck to the bamboo steam tray even though there's parchment paper on the bottom  so  the dumpling skin kinda ripped when we were taking the dumplings out of the tray  overall  delicious soup dumplings and i like it better than joe shanghai's  also just as good as nan xiang xiao long bao service was ok  there were times that the waiters were about to give us food that we didn't ordered  very weird   in my opinion at the end  i was really stuffed!!! good and tasty food here  i'm definitely coming back to try other dishes here in the future  the food is pretty cheap too and we ended up sharing $11 each for the meal 
love going here   my favorite dish is the kao fu (vegetarian) 
delicious and inexpensive! it can get crowded  and on the weekends be prepared to wait a short while (it was packed and 4 of us only had to wait about 15 minutes on a friday night)  the space is very clean and nicely decorated  they also have inside space to wait for a table  which is appreciated in the winter! we have consistently enjoyed all of the food we've been able to try  the service is quick and attentive  definitely worth a visit!
food is so so  but for the cheap price  it's a good deal! the free dumplings is a plus for sure
i am pleasantly surprised to find this place  the restaurant is new  good taste in decor  and clean  the best part is the food  the tofu flower is the best i had in flushing hands down  my new spot for breakfast in flushing 
purposely drove into flushing for some food court eatery  happened to find a parking spot right in front of yu garden and got gazed into their supersize xiaolongbao (which we did not order) advertisement on the window   the food was amazing! the 2 of us ordered the  crabmeat xiaolongbao   very flavorful  juicy  yet not greasy kaofu   just the right seasoning and texture  braised pork belly   omg good! perfect coloring yet not too salty  sweet yet refreshing  spared rib with garlic   crispy brown outside  moist inside  snow pea leaves   fresh and bit salty to my taste  in all we left as very happy customers and will definitely return and superb reviews  p s  we got an order of regular xiaolongbao on the house scored!
really great food!  the free dumplings with a check in on yelp was icing on the cake   the garlic spare ribs were sublime as was the giant soup dumpling   yum!  the seafood with udon noodles was fresh  hot and delicious as was the sesame chicken  we came at a good time as it was rather early for dinner   by the time we left  there was a huge line out the door waiting for a table!  service was excellent too!
typical shanghainese fair  but the quality was definitely there  i would go back if in the area 
excellent service  super fast  food came right after we order  it was very tasty  the price is reasonable comparing to the amount  atmosphere is very friendly  we received a dessert although we didn't order  it is a place you wanna go back and taste all what is in menu  the place is clean and cozy 
i would have rated it 3 5 stars if i could  the decor is stylish and place is very clean  love that i can see the soup dumplings being made  there is a line but they are very efficient and fast with moving everyone along  the large dumpling with only soup in there was just ok  its whimsical to eat but not to eat more than once  i had both the plain pork and pork crab soup dumplings and they were also just ok  not as flavorful and a lot less soup than shanghai joes  i also feel that they should be $$$  most dishes are $8+ and very little given for the price paid for 
i'm a huge fan of this place especially when they first opened up  for the location  the restaurant is a decent size and although sometimes there are 15 20 minutes of waiting time  the line moves fairly quickly  the staff is quick  efficient and friendly  their spend $10 to get one basket of free soup dumplings is the best part  their soup dumplings were plump  juicy although they are nothing out of the ordinary flavors  i would completely skip their noodle dishes as a few of my experiences were meh  however  if you really want to step out of your comfort zone  try some of their cold dishes  my favorites are the spicy beef and tripe and the cold gluten  the flavors are pretty mind blowing and they always taste just right! the only snafu i encountered was when the spicy beef and tripe dish only had 3 pieces of tripe with with beef slices piled high  i had to ask for more tripe (like the pictures displayed) and the chef gave me the stank eye   _ for the price and the food quality  i highly recommend!
their current promo was a pleasant surprise as me and my mom walked in to the tiny restaurant after she was raving about it the last time she came with my family members to try it out first  it was a full house but their system is very efficient and organized which is very hard to find in any restaurant in flushing  i used to swear by nan xiang since thats what i grew up knowing but this xlb place really blew me out of the water  everything was so delicious and didn't leave me with the sluggishness i'd have everytime i'd eat at nan xiang  the prices are also amazing in comparison to other xlb places i've been to considering the freshness and quality of the food  you can see the chefs preparing the buns on the spot once you walk in and it shows that regardless of how busy they are  they dont spare the time consuming labor needed to put into making their most famous soup dumplings  now i'll be swearing by this place whenever my xlb craving kicks in!
located right off main street in a not so nice block  the food is good but can get very crowded  if one can find parking  this place is a definite try 
i come here with my family often and we love it  the prices are really great for the quality and quantity of food you get  they also offer a great deal  free soup dumplings with a $10 purchase  can't find a better spot for the quality of food at this price point anywhere else 
amazing food for a great price! love the soup dumplings xiao long bao  best thing is that they're free when you order $10 or more  quick service and seating  i will definitely return here during my next trip!
okay  i finally came here because of all the statements saying this was the spot to be at and that the originals from nan xiang xiao long bao had moved over to here and honestly it was kind of a let down  yes  i am a bit biased as i have been a loyalist to nan xiang  in order to properly judge my friend and i ordered the same exact things we always order so we could compare  4 xlb orders    (when we eat  we eat)  bamboo shoots  and cucumber  how do they compare?the cucumber side dish was honestly pretty much the exact same thing the bamboo shoots at shanghai you had a hint of cinnamon going on  not saying it was a bad thing but it definitely threw me off  i think i kind of liked it more than when it didn't have that hint of flavor  it was oddly complimentary? i wouldn't have thought to add that as a spice but it definitely worked and the most important part  probably the only part of this review you are looking for    the xiao long bao! first things first  they *do* offer a free order when you get $10 worth of food (which my friend and i obviously did)  so that is quite a nice offer  however  i think that they're not as good as the ones over at nan xiang  they seemed to be less flavorful overall i likely will continue to keep going to nan xiang to get my xlb fix  but i'm happy i decided to try shanghai you out! it's definitely easier to get to by train if that's your source of transportation 
another great soup dumpling establishment  their pork soup dumplings are juicy and hot  the workers are friendly  they also serve hot tea once you sit down  their stir fried rice cake is really good 
food  3 5 5 0service  3 0 5 0value  3 0 5 0decor  3 0 5 0overall  3 5 5 0 i'm a little torn on this one   i heard great things about syg before coming and knew the lines could be long   i showed up for an early lunch on a less busy saturday with half the tables empty when i showed (~11 15am) and only a short wait as i was leaving (~12 30pm)   service was good for a chinese restaurant and staffing was more than adequate   the food  while pretty good  was honestly a bit underwhelming   the xlb seemed like a typical b+ product  and they have a big soup only (ie  no filling) soup dumpling that i was frankly disappointed by given how overwhelmingly fishy the broth soup tasted (based on other reviews it's possible they had an off day)   portion pricing on some of the cold apps seemed a bit light high i suppose this just shows how important it is to manage expectations going in   not super excited about going back a second time 
warning  no english!things i like to order here  soup dumplings "xiao long bao"  fried tiny buns called "sheng jian bao?"  beef with scallion pancake "nu ro ja bing"their xlb is alright  there are so many of these soup dumpling places popping up now  it's totally the new white person fad  haha! joe's shanghai's xlb is always my favorite because of their molten lava of lard that comes out  i go to nan xiang when i need a change then i come here when i need a change then go back to joe's and the cycle starts over  what makes this place different is their giant soup dumpling with a straw!it's a novelty  i can't see anyone getting it more than once because it's all soup  definitely order it though!their fried tiny buns are a little bigger than i'm used too and not very juicy but good enough  i really miss the way that lady with the street cart in the late 90's made them on 41st ave by the parking lot  the beef with scallion pancake is great as well!
this is our family's go to restaurant for shanghai foods  they make really authentic soup dumplings and steamed chicken  they are usually really busy and every time we had to wait for a little bit  maybe 10 mins  but they bring the foods out pretty quick after you order 
expect a wait shanghai you garden is very  very popular  but with very good reason  we were quoted about half an hour  but it ended up being around 20 minutes  luckily  they have ample seating in their waiting area  with chairs lined up against the wall  the restaurant itself is long  but the front is half kitchen and half waiting area first thing's first   check in on yelp or foursquare and you'll get a free order of soup dumplings  actually  they don't really care because they have a poster on the wall saying the same thing  they'll just comp you an order no matter what our dumplings took a bit to come out  so we actually got some premade appetizers first  the first was the jellyfish with turnip and the second was the fried bean gluten  the fried bean gluten was tasty (and a celiac sufferer's worst nightmare)  had some sweetness to it and a chewy texture  wasn't a big fan of the jellyfish though also got the scallion pancakes  which needed more salt  but were otherwise thick and pretty hefty then the soup dumplings came  we ordered a free one of the pork and paid for the crab  the pork was the better of the two  but both were great  a little flimsy  but filled to the brim  on par with the joe's shanghai in flushing  if not a tiny bit better for our mains  we shared a bunch of stuff   the noodle with beef and chili pepper (good and spicy)  the pan fried udon noodles (simple  but great)  the braised fish (really flavorful  but watch out for the bones)  and some sort of pork shoulder (tender and in this great brown sauce) the booths here are actually really big  and we fit 5 people into one the only thing that sucks is that there's only one bathroom  and there was a perpetual line i would say if the wait is under half an hour  it's worth trying out  but any more than that  and it's just excessive  it's not like flushing has a deficit of good restaurants!
both of us were pleasantly surprised how beautifully balanced was everything we ordered  things i've had many times many other places which are usually just satisfying but forgettable were  here  not just memorable but actually remarkable  the tendon and tripe  for example  was a masterpiece of perfection and presentation    this is a longtime favorite of mine  and every aspect of it was absolutely spot on  although it's not as spicy as some  it's also not as oily as just about everywhere else  and  oh my gosh  the meats were so tender  equally impressive were the superbly oceanic  unctuous  and succulent crab with pork "xlb" which were easily as good if not better than any i've ever had before  just these two dishes alone would have me returning frequently and recommending this place to anybody who would listen  but the subtlety and suavity of the tofu and the noodles and the jellyfish with radish really helped to seal the deal with how thoroughly impressed we both were with everything  even their house vinegar & chili are great! also  when all of the staff are this gracious and attentive  i really cannot wait to return 
the restaurant was packed this sunday because it is thee hot xlb place in flushing  that is why i'm here!we waited until 2 30 pm  the tail end of lunch  to go in and eat we still had to wait 20 mins after getting a number  they have a nice set of bench seating area which is very nice  by the time we got seated i was starving and will eat anything first round is "little fried buns" and "scallion pancakes"   the fried buns came out nice and hot but there was a lot of liquid inside and was very greasy; on the outside and the inside  they used too much oil  rate 3 5the scallion pancakes was bland; lacked taste and short on scallions  we asked for soy sauce or oyster sauce for the pancakes but they did not have any?! rate 3 5 next came the pork xlb  six in an order  was good  the favor is good and the soup was not too greasy; enjoyable  rate 4 5we ordered a second dish of xlb vegetable xlb  not a lot of flavor in the filling but enjoyable  rate 3 5our last dish is the shredded pork on pan fried noodles  i immediately noticed the burned noodles on the edge of the dish  the pork was small in quantity and over whelmed with chopped napa cabbage  there were mushrooms but it lack any mushroom flavor  rate 3 5decor  very clean and creative  rate 5 5service  language became a big problem because the waiters lack cantonese or english skills  3 5restroom  a problem because there is only one so there was always a line waiting to go in; i know because was seated at the last table near it and saw all the action! the single restroom is also located right next the the plating area for the waiters so there was a constant conflict between the waiters and folks waiting to pee  also when we were there they ran out of toilet paper! overall my experience was not what i expected 
i am between a 2 star and 3 star rating  since 2 star literally means "meh  i've experienced better" that's what i'm going with  maybe people are being generous because of the free basket of xiao long bao (soup dumpling)?i am not sure if i understand why people give shanghai you gardens such high ratings  we went today and we were not bowled over by the food  we ordered the pan fried pork buns which were beyond oily  it was so oily that it left a pool of oil on the table! that is just disgusting! i found the food difficult to eat because of the grease it was sitting on  we have had the pan fried pork bun dumplings in many other shanghai restaurants in nyc and philadelphia so we have others to compare it to  never again at shanghai you gardens! the scallion pancakes were crazy bland! there was no scallion taste at all  it was terrible  we were not given any sauce to flavor it  was there even scallions in it??!!the pan fried noodles with shredded pork was blah  no taste  was that canned straw mushrooms? this dish was mad bland  i've had better pan fried noodles at cantonese places  ugh  it was difficult to eat  vegetable dumplings were good but why is there a layer of oil again outside of the dumpling? i guess oil is their condiment of choice?my gosh at least the xiao long bao's were decent  that was the saving grace of the meal we had  i was very disappointed by the meal in general  the service was spotty  some of the waiters tried harder than others  some ignored us  the one lady who finally helped us was pretty patient  she worked really hard to try to help us with our meal  i felt that was nice of her  why is there one bathroom for a semi large restaurant? there were lines for the bathroom  why is the bathroom entrance where they store the plates  cups and utensils??!! weird placement  the line was in the way of the waiters  terrible layout 
found this place on yelp when i was trying to search for non dim sum in flushing  i went there with my 2 kids under 8 y o  and mother   we all loved the food   they have a system while waiting to be seated  once you get your number to wait for a table  you then get directed to sit on the bench and someone will give you a menu to look at  they will then take your order while waiting for a table  once you get seated  the food you ordered while waiting for a table will start coming out one by one  will definitely cone back  they have a big soup dumpling which we didn't order but would try out next time we go back!
the most authentic place i've ever been for yangzi river  shanghainese cuisine! so many awesome traditional dishes   make me miss home  the eel is great! and they have the best crab juicy bun  most us places including ding tai fang that sell crab juicy buns have very strong fishy unpleasant flavor  but traditionally this dish should use river crab which is not available in us  somehow the you garden solves this problem   the flavor is perfect! sweet crab taste mixed so well with pork   must have!
soup dumplings were the best i've ever had  i plan to be back soon  also   outside the place looks dirty  and my husband and i almost missed it  inside it is a true gem  great service  delicious hot tea  and great food 
this place is just ok  considering there are so many options in flushing  if you have to wait i'd skip this place  their dishes are a bit more on the sweet side  we got the free soup dumplings and didn't think it was that good 
there's always a long line in front of this restaurant so i never went in untill today  i only want to comment on the pork soup buns  the skin was too thick on both regular pork soup buns and the crab ones  and the "soup filled bun"that they let you drink with a straw was just bad  it taste like a watered down regular big meat bun   the soup in there has no taste  cold dishes were ok  the deep fried rice cake was not even fried to golden color it came out pale color  overall    not worth second a second time for me 
i love this place  being shanghainese myself  this place just makes me so happy  bringing back memories of the things i ate when i was a kid  the price is also super affordable  we ordered for 5 people  xiao long bao pork  xiao long bao crab  drunken chicken  some fish thing  stinky tofu  rice millet  you tiao  sweet soy bean drink  salty dou fu  shanghai sheng jiang bao  jellyfish with turnips  pork moon cakes and green onion pancakes with beef  they didn't have shanghai sao mai that day  sad!!! everything was delicious  biting into the xiao long bao and getting a ton of soup  amazing  sheng jiang bao also had soup inside  the rice millet thing was just the right amount of saltiness  which at first i was worried that it was gonna be too bland  but nope  perfect  the stinky tofu  wow  legit smell  only i eat this so everyone else at the table were holding their nose  which shows how legit this is  i wonder where they get the stinky tofu from since i haven't been able to find them anywhere else  total ended up being around 80$ which is a steal for how much food we got   will definitely go back!
i have never walked down this street before until few days back and saw this restaurant  so the whole family tried it  day later for brunch  the food was wonderful if you don't mind the wait and the tight spaces  they got the system figured out  you ordered while you are waiting for table and you get served quickly once you sat down  we ordered all the typical shanghai dishes and they are all excellent  the service is a bit lacking partially because we sat in the very front of the restaurant toward the street entrance  the wait staff never come this way unless we motioned them  the restaurant is very brightly lit and feel inviting  i will definitely come to try some of their other dishes 
considering flushing restaurants  the cleanness is great  the service was overall horrible let me start off saying i came here with 1 of my friend so there was 2 people total that came  we saw a booth that was open and we requested to sit there  however  they decline to let us sit there eventhough it wasn't even busy  we then ask them why we couldn't and they told us those tables were only for 6 people and more  if that was the case  why did we see another 2 people sat there? if it wasn't for my friend i would've had an argument with them  like are you for real? do have hate towards us?food wise  the cold side dishes we ordered was great  the pancake wasn't as oily as other places and the cold dishes and the was awesome  (i recommend the pancake!!!!! sooooo gooddddd!!) the free juicy pork bun was alright  the skin of the bun wasn't as good like it was left out  (dried like) but it's free so won't complain  this place would've received 4 stars if it wasn't for the service 
had the fish and preserved veggie soup and felt closer to god than any church has gotten me  cheap  authentic  and super good 
probably the best place to go to for soup dumplings and shanghainese food in flushing  the place is a little busy but with attentive and efficient staff it did not take long to start eating  the soup dumplings were much less oily than other places (both the crab  and the beef which come complimentary) and the scallion pancakes with sliced beef are a must  we also ordered the beef pan fried noodles and everything was excellent  the bill in the end was much lower than expected as well  which is always great truly transformed the flushing dining experience 
came here to just get the sheng jian bao and the xlb  then realized they give you the xlb for free! but there was a $10 minimum so   we ordered the jellyfish too  sheng jian bao   could be fried more  too much breaking compared to meat and not crispy  the jellyfish was also pretty meh  it came with some radish and was nothing special  the star for sure is the xlb  it is rather big compared to other ones  the inside was very juicy and once you poke a hole in it  the whole spoon is immersed in the nice soup 
no doubt this is one of the best shanghainese dumpling restaurant around   there are usually a long waiting line  the staffs will provide you with manus and ready to take your order while you are waiting  your dishes and delicious dumplings will be served shortly after you are seated  their system are quite efficient and worth the wait they are different choices of shau lon pau  (shanghainese steam dumplings)  nevertheless they are all made with very thin dumpling skin and to encapsulated very tasty soup and pork filling (caution  very hot) 
the best soup dumpling (xiao long bao) i've had in flushing ny  from the chewy skin  to the flavorful meat and delicious flavorful soup  one great thing i like about this hidden gem is that the food doesn't make me thirsty when i leave the restaurants  normally when eating at many restaurants in flushing the additional salt or msg in their foods forces me to chug water when i leave  another benefit to this place is they have a free yelp offer that's limited time only for a free xiao long bao order with a purchase of some $$ amount i don't recall  they have other foods that are tasty and delicious such as the scallion pancakes  udon noodles and soups  the prices are reasonable and the staff are friendly  other places in flushing such as joe shanghai are more crowded with expensive prices and less than decent food  come here to get your soup dumpling fix and you won't be dissatisfied 
a new competitor has entered the soup dumpling ring in flushing! soup dumpling lovers like us get more unique choices! win! located just across the street from the westbound exit of the lirr   main street flushing spot  decor is very impressive with a chinese calligraphy poem spreading the ceiling with red vase cut outs wall on one side and paintings on the other  whether your seat preference is are the booths or benches  it's available! my companion and i came here on a monday evening for dinner  we were able to snatch the last available table before the 7 00 pm dinner crowd floods in  with a $10 00 or more purchase at table service  your party will receive a free basket of six steamed soup dumplings! stop reading! pause! go there now! my companion and i shared a great variety of their popular dishes such as the cold appetizers   seaweed with garlic and cucumber with garlic  shanghai pan fried pork buns  steamed vegetable dumplings  little hot pepper beef dried noodles  soy milk  and of course the steamed pork soup dumplings  cold appetizers can come half and half of two choices instead of just one entire dish of the same one  this is a great opportunity to try all what they have to offer  i did like what i picked out! shanghai pan fried pork buns were so beautifully plated! it was nicely fried and topped with black sesame seeds and scallions  be warned that it is still scorching hot upon arrival and you should take a small bite first   not the whole thing! i loved how crispy the bottom was and how soft on the inside it was  and yes  meat portion is generous! steamed vegetable dumpling  yes  i am serious and not only it is healthy tasting but it is tasty! it is minced with various leafy greens like chives   yes  very distinctive flavor of it  also great with soy sauce and hot chili oil  if you don't believe in being healthy! steamed pork soup dumplings  this was a freebie basket with six soup dumplings! i was very impressed with the soup and the light gingery minced meat  there was a spoonful of soup and it is packed with flavor! the skin was on the thick side but i love dumpling skin  so it did not bother me too much  little hot pepper beef dried style noodles  overall flavor was spicy  tasty  and even the shredded beef was tender  this was good but i would get the noodle soup version next time  complimentary sweet rice wine mochi for dessert  how generous! i must admit that their menu is almost identical to nan xiang; for rumor has it that the head chef now works here  although  nan xiang still reigns as the top soup dumpling spot on my list but i would not hesitate to ditch them for this spot once in a while! not to mention  there is something called good service exists here that nan xiang lacks!side note  corner 28 take out plastic bags cracks me up! obviously  they are under the same ownership! haha!
long wait for soup dumplings    o m g with that being said soup dumplings were plump and delicious  if you check in on yelp or just mention about it  you get free pork soup dumplings on the house  dishes to order beef tendonscrab meat soup dumplingssalted soy bean curdskip out on the beef & chilli pepper noodles  noodles were too soggy and very little beef we asked for a bowl of rice three times from 3 different waiters and never received it  we said it in english and chinese  i'm not sure whats so hard to comprehend 
i came on a thursday evening around 7pm with a friend and it was pretty busy in the restaurant but we were seated immediately  waiters and waitresses were very attentive  a huge advantage is that the menu has a lot of pictures  we ordered 1 order of crab soup dumplings and an order of pork soup dumplings  we also got the scallion pancake with beef and beef udon stir fry  i have to admit  i was pretty impressed  this place exceeded my expectations and i will definitely be returning  everything was delicious  it's a cash only restaurant and i'm not too sure how long the yelp deal will last but if you check in  you can get an order of soup dumplings free!! it can't get any better then that 
gotta say  it has been a long time since i tried a new restaurant around town and the experience was great am around  the line was long but they had a really good number management system and although there was about 15 people ahead of us for a smaller restaurant  we were seated in about 10 minutes  what was a little shady but worked out pretty well  is they gave us menus to look at while we were waiting  didn't rush us or pressure us  but took our order and our food came to our table within 5 minutes of sitting down  not bad and the food was piping out and came out very fresh  aside from decor  the food reminded me a lot like din tai fung  flavors were new  clean  refreshing  and menu was very authentic and every dish we ordered was well prepared and very delicious  they had traditional breakfast items like congee  sides  soy bean milk and a very extensive menu with lots of options  if you spend more than $10   they give you a free order of steamed pork soup dumplings which in itself is tyically about $6 $7  they didn't rush us out but quick turnover was important to them for obvious reasons  all in all  service  food  and prices were all very good  the only issue which is typical of flushing is that they only take cash  but if that's not a problem  then you will have a very good overall experience 
great place for dinner! joe's shanghai and nan xiang better watch out because you garden is in town and they are here to make a statement i came here last night with a party of 4 and we were highly surprised at how good the meal was! we definitely over ordered  but i would definitely recommend  steam pork buns  steamed crab meat pork buns  pan fried dumplings  fried bean gluten  cucumber & garlic  deep fried yellow croaker with diced seaweed (don't knock this one until you try it)  spicy beef & tripe  and noodle with beef & chili pepper  the restaurant was quite busy when we arrived so one annoying thing was we had to keep waving our hand to get one of the waiters over  found that quite annoying especially seeing the waiters help other tables and then zip out of the floor before we could get their attention  but the free steam pork buns we got for checking in on yelp totally made up for it  i mean that's basically what made us want to try this place in the first place  but we were way more surprised with how delicious the food tasted  cool thing we even got to meet the owner! they also have free wifi  which has their username and password up on the wall but with delicious food in front of you  you ain't got time to be using wifi  coming back soon!!
decided to take a risk and try out a different shanghainese restaurant in flushing yesterday evening  since we've only been to the 2 establishments (nan xiang and kung fu) that we know of   not to mention  i pulled this place up on yelp and saw  besides the rave reviews  that they were offering a free steamer of pork soup dumplings upon checking in   free food? why not?we were seated right away despite the room being seemingly packed   apparently  everyone in the front were either waiting for take out or larger tables to seat bigger parties  so couples   don't be afraid  there is room for you!  the tables were also big enough to hold plenty of dishes  perfect for fatties like myself   may i add  their soup dumpling spoon is huge!  so do some lip stretches before you come here because you will need to expand those babies up we ordered the pork and crabmeat soup dumplings  along with a spicy beef brisket cold dish  chicken soup  and pork with salted cabbage noodle soup   even though the skin on the dumplings were a tad thicker than usual  they were quite flavorful   i love how the big spoon prevents spillage for the non soup dumpling eating experts   the beef brisket was also tasty   perfect amount of heat and less greasy than ones i've had   the chicken soup and noodle soup were okay  but forgettable   they also served us complimentary dessert  a "tong sui" that resembles "tong yuen" with goji berries   it was nice of them but neither of us were fans   it tasted strange   couldn't place a finger on it service was decent  but the wait staff needs to practice their engrish   besides that and the dessert  we were rather pleased and would come again!
the restaurant is pleasant on the eye when you first walk in it's clean and well lit  upon sitting down at the booth  you realize the table is too far from your set  it must have been a foreshadowing of the unsatisfying dinner to come for my family and i  to be honest  we didn't get the usual xlb and noodle dishes  but the quality of the food presented to us was terrible  serving sizes of the cold appetizers were also small we ordered some sort of sweet and spicy fried whole fish in which the sauce didn't mask how tasteless the fish was  another dish we tried was an eel dish in a brown sauce and it was hard to ignore the fishy  "dead" taste it had  the free order of xlb was nice but nothing special  the next free dish  which was the dessert soup  was just plain weird  upon the first sip  the alcohol in it was overwhelming and it shocked me because i initially assumed it would be something sweet  it was something i would have passed on even know it was complimentary  the best thing that we had was the turnip puff  a small part of our meal 
service   1 1 stargreat service  everyone was super friendly and willing to help with any issues or orders you may have  everyone at the shanghai you garden is your waiter waitress  they were there to ensure you were comfortable at all times  pricing and quantity   2 2 starsgood pricing  nothing is expensive  but nothing was cheap  they are a medium grade establishment so all prices were acceptable  the quantity of food per dish was very acceptable  i ordered the har gow (shrimp dumplings) and they were 4 of them  all good portion sizes  filled to the brim with shrimp  also took two orders of crab meat steamed soup bun and pork meat steamed soup bun  6 per order lot  but for the price point  it was very acceptable quality   1 2 starsthe items off the menu i ordered was har gow (shrimp dumplings)  two lots of crab meat steamed soup bun  two lots of pork meat steamed soup bun  and soup filled bun (house special)  the har gow was great  the dough wasn't too thick  the shrimp was abundant and perfectly seasoned  the crab meat and pork meat steamed soup buns were very fresh and not a single soup bun arrived broken  they all contained a copious amount of soup  the issue on why shanghai you garden didn't receive full stars in the quality section would result from the house special   soup filled bun  it's an awful rip off of what a traditional steamed soup bun is  the soup filled bun is exactly what it sounds like  a steamed bun filled with soup  no meat  the soup is terribly seasoned and half the soup is pretty much straight oil  definitely not an item to order total stars 4 5definitely would recommend this restaurant if you're in the area and you're craving for some steamed soup bun and wouldn't mind spending a little money  cash only  stay away from the soup filled bun 
the xiaolongbao here at shanghai you garden are great   good balance of meat and soup   the flavor could be a bit more intense for the crab pork one  but  overall i was very satisfied   chicken marinated in rice wine needed a lot more cooking time as the meat and tendon was not properly broken down and mostly inedible  the flavors of the marinade were not bad tripe is delicious but a tad too sweet for my tastes (yes shanghainese food typically errs on the sweet side) as was the scallion and beef pancake (was a bit soggy the day i went) bringing more friends back to give it another try also  two weeks ago i returned from a 5 day trip in shanghai that was filled with family and food   i was pretty disappointed in most of the places i remembered from 10 years ago   my only guess is that the rapid expansion of modern restaurants and fusion   western spots is capturing a majority of the chinese millenials    leaving the traditional and touristy spots to rot    and people dont care about quality anymore (typical chinese)    had xiaolongbao from 4 different spots including the spot in yuyuan and it all sucked   nothing like it was before   shanghai you garden surprisingly is better than most places in shanghai   sad state of chinese affairs 
the block is really skeevy  with women in 40s offering massages  the people at you garden were cordial and eager to please  and the food tasted pretty good   but i got such a dose of msg! went in with a very empty stomach  ready to chow down  we enjoyed the food pretty well  though the dumplings weren't the greatest  after about 20 minutes  though  when the food got to my stomach  my heart starting racing  skin got clammy  and my jawline got that uncomfortable tingle that means it's msg  for about a minute  i could hardly speak as i rode that chemically induced wave  my friend said i looked really pale  maybe it's an allergic reaction  because he was not affected  it was like having a seizure  it happened about an hour ago  and i'm over it  but there's no reason for me to go back 
the best spot in the middle of flushing  if you want a glimpse into delicious shanghai style food this is the place to go  service is great most of the time and the prices are even better  make sure to order $10 worth of food to then get a free tray of pork soup dumplings 
food is good   service used to be better   the way they handle take out is just terrible   we called in for an order at one time  food still wasn't ready after almost an hour    dine in is priority for them   also  beware of the way they calculate your bill   we ordered a dish for take out after dining in   the waiter included the take out dish to the dine in bill  which was ok; but they also calculated the 15% service charge on the entire bill    we thought it wasn't correct but paid it anyway   what gets us more upset was the waiter decided it was not enough  $5 tip on a $30 bill   he harassed us for another $2   my family used to go to this restaurant frequently when it was first opened   we are no longer patrons there due to the service     plenty of choices elsewhere 
excellent soup dumplings  very nice atmosphere  scallion pancake with beef was incredible  i also love the scallion and onion bun  loves the fried fish with seaweed also 
as you walked into a very clean establishment with beautiful decor and ceiling hunged with chinese calligraphy  the booths were taken but the server seated us at a half booth and chairs table  my mom ordered up a storm as she's an ultimate foodie without writing reviews  she ordered fried bean gluten  chicken with wine sauce  pork xiao long bao  pork & crab xiao long bao (my favorite)  and pork chop noodle soup  i love the tiniest of the soup dumpling wrapper   bite a little hole then suck up the delicious soup *hubba hubba* i lost count of how many i ate but it was so yummy as i was under the weather  the pork chop was kept separate from the noodle soup which always good  the broth was very tasty and warmhearted for my cold  the pork chop was so crispy and noodles were really thin along with bok choy  my ordered the braised fish and braised deep fried round hoof to go  apparently its under the same ownership as corner 28  i am dreaming of coming back for some more delicious food!
i tried this place at the recommendation of my boss  you garden is now my recommendation for xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) in flushing  in my opinion  you garden seems to have slightly better food and service than its competitors dishes we've had   crab xiaolongbao (螃粉小龍寶)  you garden's version is a thin skinned dumpling with a rich and flavorful broth  by comparison  kung fu xiao long bao's xiaolongbao is very good  too  with a more delicate skin  but muted broth  nan xiang xiao long bao's version also has a flavorful broth  but thicker skin all around  in general  get one order for every 2 people in your party  you garden supplies an empty condiment dish with thin ginger strips for each person  meant to hold vinegar  it's a small detail sometimes absent at other restaurants   cucumber and garlic (脆囗青瓜)  the restaurant's version comes with cilantro  recommended (unless you have an aversion to cilantro)   beef pan fried udon noodle (牛肉粗炒麵)  this version is less greasy and has more meat and vegetables compared to surrounding restaurants  recommended   special spare ribs with garlic sauce (蒜香骨)  deep fried goodness  one rib per order   fermented glutinous rice dumpling (酒釀圓子)   complementary dessert of glutinous rice balls with wolfberries in a rice wine congee soup  an unusual taste more suited to adults than children  but a delightful dessert nonetheless logistics you garden is generally crowded  but they make efficient use of wait time  they generally ask you to review the menu and order while you are waiting to be seated  such that your food comes in a timely manner shortly after you are seated  the trade off for inexpensive  high quality food is customer turnover    this is not a place to have a slow dinner  the restaurant staff would like to you eat your meal comfortably  but then leave shortly afterwards to make room for waiting customers other msg  if used  was undetectable overall  five stars  for great food  efficient service  and a clean  well decorated  and comfortable environment 
ordered two orders of the crab pork soup dumplings and a scallion pancake yesterday at around noon  i don't know how they cook these things but i got sick within a couple of hours and now i'm up in the middle of the night with pain  also long wait for this take out order 
i was there with my family during the late afternoon  to try their steamed pork buns and other items when we got there  it wasn't packed with a lot of people  so that was a good thing we ordered several items like soup filled bun  fried stinky tofu  along with scallion pancake and chicken in cold wine sauce the foods was delicious and the price was worth it the staff gave us a free order of steamed pork buns overall  if you want to have a relax and enjoyable meal with your family  this is the place 
small hidden dim sum place   you can actually watch them make the fresh dumplings right there   the food is great but not sure if it suppose to taste like the shanghai style or it lacks a little flavor   customer service is excellent 
i love this place  it's outside doesn't do it justice  the restaurant itself is really large and can fit many tables  it's clean  the workers are friendly  prices are cheap  and the free soup dumpling deal is bomb  i love having a worthy option other than nan xiang  the noodles  dumplings  soups   they're all good  they always give you a rice wine mochi for dessert  i personally don't like it  but i think it's just an acquired taste  they are cash only but there is an atm inside i can't wait to try the individual large dumpling that you drink with a straw 
i am shanghainese and the food served here is really authentic depending on what you get  the steamed soup dumplings are amazing!!! take advantage of the free dumplings if you order over $10 for dine in  the shanghainese meatballs are also really flavorful and good  better paired with rice to reduce the saltiness  highly recommend the pan fried pork buns as well!! the bottom is very crispy and the filling is delicious and juicy i personally enjoyed the stinky tofu but the sauce it came with was a little disappointing  it isn't as thick and flavorful as it should be  the shanghainese lomein is also a bit of a let down  but then again  i haven't found anywhere that makes it really well and authentic overall  i recommend this place but know what you want and do research on what you should get!
this place is definitely better than other shanghainese restaurants in the area but i must say   some of the waitresses were extremely rude and even pushy since my party of three only ordered 5 dishes which is apparently not enough to them  the rude service bumps them down to three stars but i would say the food redeems the poor service the soup dumplings definitely had lots of flavor and soup! (and they're free with your meal too which is great!)  the taro cakes were bit of a let down since there wasn't much flavor to them but paired with the hot sauce that was provided on the tables  it was much better! the spring rolls are much better than the taro cakes  the hainanese chicken was also quite tasty overall  the dining area is really comfortable and the food is quite good  just watch out for some of those nasty waitresses who seem to really hate their job 
excellent!went there for the first time  after noticing the lack of super long lines this particular morning  with the wife and a 1 5 year old soybean milk   excellent  smooth flavor  not watered down  and could not detect any particles that you sometimes find from lesser vendors  superb quality!scallion pancakes   very good  thin & flaky  not too thick nor overly fried youtiao (chinese fried dough)   pretty good as well   hot upon arrival  could be crispier though  but since it would be dipped into the soybean milk before consumption  does not matter shanghai shao mai   dim sum with sticky rice  excellent and well made  the little one loved it (she has very selective taste buds) fried pork dumplings & vegetable dumplings   was too full after the above to try them  but looked great! took them home steamed pork buns   bonus! was given an order for free  we didn't realize until they arrived & reviewed the check thereafter  phenomenal  perfect composition of thin outer layer while the internal contents were perfectly hot and juicy!we'll definitely come back often and bring friends!
amazing spot for cheap and authentic shanghainese dim sum  this is literally the only place i go to every time i'm in flushing  if we lived closer i would come here every week  doesn't hurt that there's free soup dumplings for every table that orders $10 or more 
ok    i know i'm supposed to fall in love with their xiao (sil) long bao  aka soup dumplings    so here's a twist!logistics  parking is beyond horrendous in flushing (for ages!)  so park at sky view mall (best option)  speed walk over to shanghai you garden (bonus  if this place is beyond pack  head over to the new world mall food court and feast!)   we didn't want the lunch crowd so we aimed for an early brunch  arrived at 10 45am  no wait   the booth seatings are huge  comfy for a party of 4 or 6    food  (thanks yelp check in offer! free pork soup dumplings)   total bill w  tip  $64 (pretty darn cheap eats!)  crabmeat soup dumplings  tasty but when i peeked inside  there's like a tiny spat of crab meat    (not over flowing like the ones at e noodle)  pan fried pork dumplings  skins are too thick    family loved it  but i prefer my fried dumplings with thinner skins for extra crispiness  the filling was ok  too much pork  would be nice to have some chives in it   stir fry rice cake w  preserved (snow) cabbage & slice pork  signature shanghainese dish  this one was good  a bit oily but well seasoned   noodle soup w  preserved (snow) cabbage & slice pork  also very good  loved the flavor   scallion pancakes  crispy  flavorful  family loved it  (we didn't get the one w  beef bc we ordered too much already)  fried yellow croacker w  seaweed  this was too oily but i really liked the texture of the fish  however becareful as there were many tiny little bones!  jelly fish w  pickled radish  effing amazing! i love jelly fish  i love pickles radish  hence i totally loved this dish! this dish alone gives them 4 stars  the taste is very refreshing  palate tantalizing and seriously just good  i took away 1 star for  a) "semi rushed service"  i get you want a fast turn around but look at your audience  we ordered so much food  there was no way we could have finished in 15 20 mins    no need to "eye ball us"   b) forgetting to refill our tea pot  even though we did the "traditional" signal of 'our pot is empty' w  the lid on top of the pot  c) what happened to the free dessert? maybe bc we were having lunch & not dinner? but how come some customers got free "tong shiu"? oh well    we were too full anyway  i would trek out to flushing again for the jelly fish dish! happy "soup dumpling" eating yelpers!
we didn't need to check in to get a free order of xlbs  we added an order of xlbs with crab  spicy beef and tripe  and scallion pancake stuffed with beef to round out our starters  for main courses  we chose the crystal shrimp and grandma style pork the xiao long bao were good  if not quite as perfect as the ones at nan xiang  they were at perfect temperature and did not stick to the steamer  the spicy beef and tripe was pretty tender  and the level of heat hit the spot  the killer app was that stuffed pancake  i saw andrew zimmern stand in a line in for 45 minutes to snag something similar from a shanghai street vendor  i can't imagine that the one he had was all that much better than this one  which was savory  flaky and crisp  the crystal shrimp were  as i suspected sort of like har kow filling but with whole shrimp  a nice portion of good seafood  the pork proved to be stewed pork belly  not too fat in a mild sauce  almost like barbecue service was very good  i would certainly return cash only 
i've always gone to nan xiang xiao long bao on prince street because that is my favorite place to get soup dumplings  but my cousin had brought me to this place  and oh man  it was worth it  they have very similar stuff on their menu to nan xiang xiao long bao  with a few unique additional items that i'd highly recommend (see pictures)  the soup dumplings tasted just as great and none of them broke  also it was awesome that they give a free order of soup dumplings with a check in on yelp  among my favorite dishes are the fried bean gluten  cucumber&garlic  and the deep fried yellow croaker with dried seaweed to name a few  i wasn't disappointed at all with this place and will definitely be bringing my friends to join me the next time i go  the service was also on point  we had a 30 minute wait for a table (party of four on a friday night)  but while you wait they can take your order  as soon as we sat down within 5 10 minutes all of our dishes were coming to our table  which also really won me over with this place  i'm glad to have a new soup dumpling place to go to in flushing!
the food hit the spot!  the waiter offered the free xiao loong baos w o us even mentioning it  can't beat free food!  they were actually really good  we had jellyfish  cukes  fried gluten  beef scallion pancakes and the baos  all was delicious and we saw lots more that we wanted to try  aside from the long wait  and the bothersome flies  the meal was pretty good  outside the restaurant was another story  the street is so stinky  garbage laden  prob the source of the fly   why can't they do something about the garbage?
great food and good service compared to other restaurants in the area  definitely get the beef and pepper noodles! you get free soup dumplings with any order above $15 so plan accordingly 
food  i especially liked their beef scallion pancake which was crispy but yet chewy and wrapped around a good amount of beef  the pan fried pork buns were the closest to what i had in shanghai  their large meatballs  while perhaps a little too doused in sauce  were delicious as well! service  quick! i came with a party of 9 hygiene  pretty good for flushing chinatown
i'm quite glad that this place is slightly hidden (in the alley area that everyone hates going to)  because it is so much better than nan xiang dumpling place   good quality food along with a better looking restaurant + no lines i don't know how long this promotion is going to last  but you basically get one basket of free soup dumplings (super worth   i saw a lady come in and order a tiny little appetizer just for the soup dumplings)  the menu selection looks similar to that of nan xiang  but comes with more variety and selection  the restaurant is also gorgeous  the decor is amazing all in all  the food tastes good and the price is right + no wait + neat looking atmosphere 
best dim sum in the tri state area! i have always just assumed that china town would be the place to get dim sum  but i have recently learned that chinatown is nothing short of a tourist trap  i know that the quick trip to canal street is more convenient for nyc residents  but you will pay double as much for half the quality  the dim sum from shanghai you garden was out of this world!! with the free round of pork buns for checking in on yelp  you can leave with a full belly for $15 per person  if you are looking for the real deal "authentic" dimsum  i promise you the trip is worth it  i also tried jellyfish for the first time  which was  phenomenal  i would not have ordered such an exotic dish from an establishment that i do not trust 
if you order more than $10  you get a free pork soup dumplings  im sold  my friend and i got the spicy beef and tripe as appetizers  the pork and cabbage noodles  and crabmeat soup dumplings  the food was really delicious  the environment is clean and it does get busy through out the night   our server was a bit rude to us in the beginning  which got me a bit upset  but at least  we weren't being rushed to finish our meal and pay  despite that  i'll still come back for dinner   remember to bring some cash since it doesn't accept credit cards 
my first visit was quite pleasant but the second not so much my friends and i order the crab pork soup dumplings (we got the free check in pork soup dumplings)  rice cake with preserved cabbage  and spicy bamboo shoots  the food was pretty good and it's cheap  our meal came out to approx  $21  i would only come back for the cheap food  the service like any other chinese place sucks  rude people who forgets your order and try to rush you out  they also did not give us our free dessert  ***make sure you check in to redeem your free dumplings!
whenever my shanghainese relatives are in town  i always take them out here  the food is great and the servers are actually shanghainese! every single meal i've had here has been a great experience 
good food but slow service and bad communication between staff  i ordered two simple fried dishes to go for thanksgiving with my family  i stepped out and bought outside dishes from other restaurants  returned half an hour later (with the outside dishes already in hand) and still ended up waiting for my dishes  another time  i came with my family  we ordered a lot and decided to take some left over buns home  we waited for the waiter to return  only to find out 15 minutes later    all the staff seemed to be clueless about the existence of our take out  they stood around waiting to see if we recognized which staff may have took it  they're just buns!!! why couldn't they believe us  apologize and give us new buns  and then send us home? i have no clue  but this place needs to get their s    together  always disappointing experiences 
this place is nice because they give you a lot of free stuff  there is a wait  but it's not super long  i really like their cold appetizers (beef tendons  vegetables ) it really is quite similar to nan xiang but it is more posh and seems cleaner  the price point is similar  we ordered the shen jiang tang bao  but they said it would take a long time  for our trouble  they said they would give us a free steamer of pork xlb in addition to the shen jiang bao  then at the end  we got free dessert as well  we were so full! i had a great time here  the only thing is i wouldn't come here with a group because they seem to rush you along a little 
this place has pretty good soup dumplings  i still do not think their soup dumplings beat the ones at nan xiang dumpling house  a little pricer too  i went there just for the huge sized soup dumpling  which was eh  it was pricy (~$4 5) and it did not taste that great  my friends and i got it mainly for the pictures! we ordered the beef scallion pancakes  shanghai house special noodles  szechuan wontons  and some rice cakes  all were mediocre!
wow  where do i begin with all the things we ordered here? i cam here with a few friends for a flushing half day trip (it's far for us manhattanites!) and we ordered the you tiao  two orders of the xlb  the fried pork buns  a noodle dish  scallion pancakes with meat inside  some dim sum  and a fried red bean paste dessert  but really  the xlb is the reason to come here  needless to say we were completely full from all the delicious food  none of us ate for the rest of the day  oh  and the bill came out to $12 person  that makes me happy
in a crowded area of really great asian food  this place fared pretty well   i only ordered the pork soup dumplings and the rice cakes   the soup dumplings were good but not the best flushing has to offer   the skin was very thin and more than half broke apart from the chopsticks to the spoon transition   which to me was a real bummer because i totally dig the explosion of juiciness that occurs when the skin doesn't break   the dumplings are however a little lighter in fattiness compared to joe's shanghai or nan xiang xiao long bao   i prefer the richness of those places but that's just me   the rice cake with shredded pork was good and a little less oily than some of the other places i've tried  but they were also a bit more bland all in all  it was still a pretty solid place and had the dumpling skin been just a tad thicker  i would have bumped this up to 4 stars 
the soup dumplings are superb and the noodles were fresh  i had the pan fried noodles and the beef udons  they were really good  they have a  the price can't be beat  it will be hard to find parking nearby  it gets so busy that food service can be a bit rushed  can't knock the hustle  you may have to wait outside and they will pressure you to order before you sit if you come during busy hours on the weekend 
nan xiang dumpling house has always been my go to place in flushing but i am no longer going there after discovering this place  below is the comparison  service  winner   you garden efficiency of line  winner   you garden physical environment  winner   you gardencrispy noodle  winner   you gardencrab soup dumpling  winner   nan xiangregular soup dumpling  winner   you gardenpork and vegetable wonton  winner   you garden soy milk  tied overall experience  clear winner   you gardeni really appreciated the fact they seated us without the whole party present as most places require everyone be there before they are willing to seat you  additionally  they give you a free regular soup dumpling (6 pieces) if you spend $10 plus a free traditional shanghainese dessert (fermented wine rice ball)  can't wait to go back again!!
i've ordered from here a couple of times but haven't been to there to dine in until today  we were so hungry we forgot to take pictures  the soup dumplings are so good that you don't even need the sauce to go with it  i have always been to nanxiang and now i've fallen in love with this place  i personally think you's soup dumplings are a bit better than other places around the area  only thing is that they don't accept cards  definitely coming back when i'm craving soup dumplings!
the soup dumplings were great here! compared to the rest of flushing the service here was pretty friendly  the restaurant was clean and the food was good  we got the rice cake noodles with pork  pork soup dumplings and the giant soup dumpling which was ehhh but only because it did not have meat in it and it was a little oily for my taste  otherwise good decent sized soup dumpling restaurant!
good shanghainese food! it is extremely popular so expect a long wait  i came here with my family on a monday for lunch and we waited about an hour  it's frustrating though because they tell everyone that it's about a 20 25 minute wait when in reality you can see at least 8 10 parties ahead of you  on the window  they write in chinese that if your wait time is over an hour  you get a free order of pork soup dumplings so i imagine basically everyone gets a free order  we ordered a variety of dishes   pork soup dumplings (free) and crab & pork soup dumplings  the star of the show  i definitely recommend the crab and pork ones over just pork because it is much richer  the soup inside is bursting with flavor and the skin is just the right chewiness and thickness to contain it all  also love the little dispensers for vinegar and separate bowls for eating soup dumplings so it's less messy!   fried pork buns  very crisp and flavorful  but it was extremely greasy  when you bite into the bun  the oil coats your mouth and overpowers everything else    spicy beef tendon  one of my favorite appetizers  they portion is quite generous and the tendon is thinly sliced and chilled  i do wish it were a little spicier  but it goes well with the hot sauce that they have on the table    scallion pancake  pretty standard  not too greasy and very crispy    turnip puffs  these came out still warm and the puff was very flakey and buttery  i didn't really care for the turnip filling  but my family loved them    rice cake with shredded pork and preserved vegetable  i was disappointed that this dish didn't really have much flavor and was a bit bland  since it's a staple in shanghai cuisine  it was also a bit too greasy  the service is quite good compared to similar chinese restaurants and the seating is roomy and comfortable  all in all  shanghai you garden is a great option for shanghai cuisine but i don't think it's worth the long 1+ hour waits  however  i do believe it's worth checking out if you're in the area and it's not packed!
the food is reasonably price but very palatable  definitely one of the best southern chinese cuisines  in flushing  the newly renovated dinning area and friendly wait staffs are a huge plus 
the service and food was ok  they give free xiao long bao if you order more than $10  the place always packed especially dinner time  cash only 
stopped by here for breakfast  pretty excited they were open so early  of course i ordered the soup dumplings  which were in fact  delicious  a side dish i tried out was the shanghai shu mai  definitely different from the shu mai that i am used to (i'm a basic dim sum er)  overall very clean spot given it's flushing  i would definitely come back for the soup dumplings 
probably one of the best soup dumplings place you can find in flushing if not nyc  what can go wrong when they give you a free order of soup dumplings when you order $10 or more?! the crab dumplings are my favorite  the wait staffs are nice  decor fits the theme  price is fair  yup  my go to spot!
clean environment  tasty food  xiao long bao and shanghai smoked fish are must haves 
who gives out free soup dumplings with any order of $10 +? this restaurant does!! the food is pretty good especially the beef scallion pancakes and vegetable dumplings  long line to get in during lunch and dinner time so that's the only con i can think of 
trekked here to see if it was better than the manhattan xlb options  or nan xiang in flushing concluded that i don't need to go to flushing for xlb anymore  shanghai you garden is a nice restaurant  with above average ambience (by comparison  nan xiang is a dive) and friendly service  while the dumplings are tasty  the skins are thicker and the filling not quite as good as other places like nan xiang in flushing  or any of the manhattan options manhattan xlb options have come a long way  in midtown  kung fu ramen makes my favorite xlb at the moment (only problem   they are stingy with the chili bean sauce if they have it at all)  thin wrapper  very flavorful filling  downtown  shanghai heping makes xlb worth traveling for  joe's shanghai is still delicious  and shanhgai cafe & 456 are good too 
best shanghainese food i've had in the states   for a westerner  i have half a clue  my wife is shanghainese and we go there annually  delicious  every dish was great  prices very reasonable  soup dumplings better than joe's shanghai  with a delightful smokey note to them  and  in an unusual twist for american chinese restaurants  pleasant service with a smile  my wife and daughter were there too  and give it the authentic thumbs up!
the soup dumplings were complimentary  the broth was good and they were generous with the pork  we also had an eel dish which did not taste like eel  lots of flavor and enjoyable  the udon fried noodle dish was ok and seemed small and is really good as an individual dish  the decor was nice but the utensils were a bit greasy so i'm not sure how well they clean the dishware  the waiters are not very attentive  we came on a wednesday afternoon and the place was full  i can't imagine what it's like on weekends  parking and traffic is terrible all around in flushing so plan on parking far or waiting for a spot for a long time 
many dishes such as eel shanghai style  browned fish  beat joe shanghai s  except crab xiao long bao   provides so many old shanghai cuisines  one of the best shanghainess  in flushing  always crowded though  no parking which makes going these is like a big event 
yet another relatively new soup dumpling shanghai restaurant popping up in flushing  which gives moreee options! i decided to come here before their promotion is over  which is spend atleast $10 and you automatically get a free pork soup dumpling  i loveee xiao long baos (soup dumplings) and though i love nan xiang  i've been hearing the service and food has been lacking lately so i was compelled to give this place a shot    plus rumors on the street was  the head chef of nan xiang went over here anyways    have not yet got to find out how accurate that is though  service & ambiance   the place is a smaller than nan xiang's and perhaps even a little smaller than joe's    but the decor is very modern asian  with an open preparation window in the front where you see the ladies preparing the xiao long baos and cold appetizers in the display  the tables are big and nice  and some are separated in a semi booth with an open feel  the service is much more attentive and quicker than nan xiang i must admit food  so yes  kung fu's and you garden's menu is pretty identical to nan xiang's scallion pancake with beef   flaky  crispy  lightly battered and fried  satisfying! the only thing i would nit pick to its competitor nan xiang  is that the pancake itself was thicker and didn't wrap around the beef as properly as nan's which = messier xlb soup dumplings   we ordered a crab one  and recieved a freebie of pork  i was impressed by the soup dumplings  it was super soupy and plump  the broth was good  skin was thin and soft  and the crab one had a good amount of crabmeat (still  none of them are as crabby as joe's)wine chicken   i say pass on this  i've had much better wine chicken at other shanghai establishments  the chicken was just hard  dry even for dark meat and super cold  we actually wanted to order the "shanghai special chicken" instead but they claimed no more dark meat    but it looked so good from the guy next to us who ordered it cucumbers w  garlic   this is something i really love ordering everytime at nan's  it's still very enjoyable and almost on par with nan's from hereover all  i'm already planning my next visit here to try the other food i normally love ordering but held back on such as the spicy beef with tendons and tripe  and other goodies on the menu! everything smelled soo amazing and looked so good all around me from everyone  i have not tried kung fu for overall comparison to nan's recently since i've heard from multiple people they're really falling off  but when i do and then try the rest of the menu  i sha'll post an updated review !
shanghai you garden has a very sleek  trendy interior that has very eastern influences  the restaurant is well air conditioned in the summertime  and the service is very quick  we were seated almost immediately  even though the restaurant was packed during lunchtime i'm not usually a fan of dumplings (which  apparently  is shanghai's specialty)  but this place was an exception  as an appetizer  we had garlic cucumber  which was very flavorful and fragrant  i would highly recommend this to stimulate your appetite prior to the main courses  it's very refreshing  after that  we had sweetened soy milk  which was the smoothest  most creamy stuff i had ever had  for main dishes  we had shanghai stir fried udon  seafood noodle soup  and a rice cake dish (forgot what it was called)  and three orders of pork dumplings speaking of the pork dumplings  they were like little pouches of magic  my dad  who had frequented shanghai before  instructed us to bit the topmost part off  let it cool a bit  suck out the juices and then eat the whole dumpling  skin and meat filling and all  i had maybe one dumpling  savoring the deliciously soupy insides  i looked over for more  but by the time i turned around  all three orders of dumplings (18 dumplings  since 6 come in each order) were already gone  that goes to show how good they are!they offer a deal where eating in and paying at least $10 for a meal will get you a free order of pork dumplings  i highly recommend that you use this to your advantage so you can sample one of their most famous wares for relatively little money 
this places is tucked in flushing  small venue dont be discouraged by the surroundings  i dont have to tell you that there is no parking nearby  there is hint of a stench of garbage out on the sidewalk but leav i ng that alone  let me focus on the food experience  i walked in about 6 30pm on a friday night   we had  party of 5ppl  so they gave us the funky room at the entrance of the restaurant which separates you from the main room  kind of like a vip room that they have  we starded with 2 appetizers   the spicy tripe with  thinly sliced beef and the cucumber with garlic &  sesame oil  both were very good  i was most amazed that the tripe was really clean and very tasty  upon checking in with the yelp app  we got a 1 free order of soup buns but we are pigs so we order another order  the soup dumplings were delicious   my brother in law was mode familiar with the menu so he order the braised pork shoulder with veggie(super yummy succulent pork  that falls off the bone) this is a platter that requires lots of rice so that uou can soak up the rich brown sauce  we wanted to play safe  so we asked for general tso chicken which was tasty and it came with some broccoli  there was an order of sautéed crystal baby shrimp  really tasty shrimp  the highlight of our dinner was the fish head soup  with crystal  noodles  wow it had an amazing richness of pork and fish and the noodles are clear  flat just like a lasagna noodle but with texture to soak up the soup  the food was delicious  lots of variety   good size servings  now when it comes to the service  i had 2 of my family members that are fluent chinese (cantonese and mandarin) speakers  given that they ordered the food for the entire table  i noticed that several times my brother in law had to get up to either go speak to the waiter or to go get check on missing items for the table  the service could have been better  right fown to the point when they bring the soup  we all looked at the waitress  ah hello we need a soup laddle to serve the soul  my brother in law said something to the lady and it took a while to get soup bowls and a laddleall throughout dinner they would always forget something for the table   i can tell you they have a a from the department of health  which is a good sign  i cannot wait to go back and try the lunch specials  i end up parking at the sky mall for $3 with no hassle  i highly recommend this restaurant and their food  be patient with the servers and tell them everythjng 2x  lol 
long wait on a saturday but totally worth it  they take your order while you wait  service is effective  but don't expect smiles and chit chat or english  as a matter of fact  you sit  eat  enjoy and go  dumplings  specially the crab dumplings are amazing  and so is the spicy tripe    great value (i think we paid half of what we would have paid in nj for the same amount of dishes  and for sure they wouldn't have tasted as good)  totally worth the 1 1 2 hour drive each way  plus 45 min  wait  plus the tolls and parking and gas 
about a 15 minute wait on a sunday evening  front door staff were pleasant and took our order while we waited  wait staff once inside were quick and polite (not rude at all)  my friend and i split udon noodles with beef  cucumbers with garlic  and a free order of soup dumplings from the yelp check in  $15+tip  delicious food  one of us could have eaten the udon dish on our own  but this way we could split the buns  i'll definitely be back 
shanghai you garden is one out of the many dumpling spots in flushing  although all the different types of branches opening get a bit redundant  this xiao long bao spot was pretty good  i went with a group of 6 people and the bill came out to only around $50 which is amazing for the amount of food you get  the xiao long baos are really tasty and might actually be better than their competitor's; joe's shanghai and ning xiang  the only downside is that they seem to rush you while you are eating  and the servers can seem a bit lost and chaotic 
this place is great  me and my girlfriend come here all the time if we go out to flushing  the prices are cheap and the food is great  you can also get a free order of soup dumplings if you order over 15 dollars i think  personally the soup dumlpings are my favorite part  i love this place 
they started clearing the table while i was still eating and asked which dishes they should pack for us to go  the food here is pretty good  but what stood out most had to be the rude service  i came with the family for lunch during the weekend and we waited about 20 mins  for a table  not even 5 mins  after sitting down  we were already asked twice if we were ready to order yet  we ordered the soup dumplings  crab soup dumplings  pan fried buns  deep fried yellow croaker w seaweed  vegetable noodle soup  wine chicken and red bean puffs  the crab dumplings were just ok compared to other places i've tried  but the regular soup dumplings were pretty good  there was a good amount of soup in the dumplings  but the texture of the skin could've been better; it was a bit thick and chewy  i thought the wine chicken and the red bean puffs were really good and i would definitely recommend giving them a try  the noodles and ingredients in the noodle soup were very fresh so if you have room for it  a good option  the fried yellow croaker and pan fried buns were just eh  pass  the decor is modern and nice  but you don't have much time to appreciate it since they rush customers out  if they are concerned about customers having too long of a wait for seats  they should just tighten the seating and put in more tables  as a fellow yelper mentioned  they only have one bathroom so there was a line of people waiting by the bins of used dishes and utensils  it's just odd  overall  this place is an option for a quick bite  but there are definitely some better options for shanghainese food in the area! i don't think i'll be coming back 
i go here for brunch on the weekend every month at least   line can get long but moves pretty fast l   free xlb if you order $10 or so   get the niurou juanbing (pancake with beef)  the youtiao and doujiang (cruller with soy milk)  shengjianbao (pan fried bao)  the shaomai  and the hongyouchshou (wonton in spicy oil)   lots of carbs  but all taste good and easy to take home and have for a 2nd breakfast snack 
new xiao long bao place that opened in flushing  the buns are great  the skin is not too thick and not too thin so it doesn't pop easily nor does it feel like you're eating a glob of dough  the soup to meat ratio on the inside is good too  and they gave us a free order of regular soup dumplings and tong shui at the end of our meal  only downside is they only have noodle dishes and no rice dishes  but that's okay cus we here for the dumplings anyway  would recommend to our friends 
been here a couple of times since they first opened last year  the food and service don't disappoint! they are awesome in so many ways   so do yourselves a favor and skip out on the overrated nan xiang or joe's shanghai a few reasons    they still offer free pork xlb if you order $10+   check in on yelp  which i find truly awesome (it was originally just for their grand opening period!)  they take your order while you wait  so you'll be served once you're seated  their scallion pancake with sliced beef portion is quite generous compared to nan xiang (a lot more beef to pancake ratio)  nothing is overly greasy  they always finish your meal with some sweet rice cake soupalso love the decor and the authentic feel of this place  you can easily tell that this place is a favorite among the shanghainese community (almost all the diners there spoke the dialect) 
i always to go a shanghainese restaurant with low expectations because i have not yet found a good one  until tonight  i was pretty happy   their menu is full of authentic shanghainese dishes  we only ordered small dishes such as pan friend dumplings  steam dumplings  scallion pancakes  this fried rice dish (no idea what it is  it's a square rice call with a crunch outside)  salty soy milk  and this fried yellow croaker with dried seaweed (super yum)  we are def  coming back for more   wanna try their main dishes badly!
i've pledged loyalty to nan xiang  but after eating here  i'm sure it will give nan xiang a run for its money!  it's clean (had to see it with my own eyes after reading anna h 's review)  bright and the soup dumplings were delish!  you also get a free order of pork dumplings and a dessert with your meal   my only gripe was that our order of jellyfish was lacking   a few pieces of jellyfish among the massive plate of daikon   i really had to search for it   we also received the wrong order of pork dumplings when we ordered the crab pork dumplings  but they quickly realized and corrected the situation   i will have to come back to try some other dishes 
we had lunch here today with my old friend and her and we were pleasantly surprised with the artistry of the food and the low price  having so much variety   we ordered the xiao long bao  double cooked pork grandma style  rice cakes with shredded pork   tofu porridge  yeow teow  and taro balls  my it was good and tasty   these new places pooping up in flushing lately have upped their game with the influx of maunland chinese from the north vs the standard fujianese and cantonese variants 
came here today at around 2pm  and it was busy   focusing on the food  we ordered the crab and pork xiaolong bao steamed bun  and got an order of the pork xiao long bao for the yelp check in   these were good   i saw the reviews commenting on nanjing and joe shanghai   these dumpling skins  at least today were a good thickness and taste   they were not thick like joe's are at times  and there is some variability with nanjing's   whether this place has variability remains to be seen   there was ample soup that was not too sweet  and the filling had good consistency   i also felt that you could make out the difference between the crab containing ones and the pork only   i honestly like joe's as well  but they are just different than most xiao long bao almost to not really consider them in the same food group     these are trying to be more like nanjing  and i dare say din tai fung  and other places i have been in shanghai   it's not to say that these are better  just that they were good and similar to   they hit the spot   we also had the jellyfish and turnip  and the taste was good if not amazing   the turnip gives it a different flavor than mainly jellyfish   the deep fried croaker was good   the wuxi styled ribs were very soft fall off the bone type ribs   we had the seafood udon noodles which was a smaller than expected portion  with less seafood than say joe's   all in all it was a good meal   the kids enjoyed it   the booth seating is good for adults and probably teenagers  but the seat distance to tables is far for kids   i honestly stood up while in the booth to help serve food  which in a typical booth is hard to do   service was fine and not really chaotic as some other reviews described 
in the midst of all the dumpling spots in flushing that i have been to  shanghai you garden is definitely on the top of the list  the restaurant itself was nicely decorated  clean  and had the friendliest staff! the restaurant is definitely busy during the evening and reasonably so  we went there on a thursday and friday night on separate weeks  the wait on thursday night was not too bad  probably 10 min  on friday  there was about an 20 minute wait  but they do have a number system and take your order while you're waiting  so there's no time wasted in getting your food now on for the food  i've been here two separate times  and the food has been consistent and delicious both times 1  special spare ribs with garlic sauce  fried crispy skin with well cooked meat to compliment  my boyfriend said he would make a meal out of this one item  so you know it was good 2  shrimp dumplings  all i have to say is that  there was seductive shrimp in every bite! 3  steamed crab meat pork bun  filling and flavorful 4  pan fried dumplings  good    i was kind of already full at this point  so i thought they were good 5  cold soy sauce duck  let me start off my saying when i first got there  i was mindlessly just flipping through pages and looking at pictures so i did not see that this was a cold dish  but it was delicious! when i first took a bite  it was slightly cold  as the soy sauce was warm  hey  i didn't care that it was cold because i finished it to the last bite 6  beef & chili pepper w  noodle soup  again  i was slightly full to even enjoy this soup  although  it was still flavorful and slightly spicy so don't shy away because you see chili peppers both times we did receive the complimentary pork buns and they were as flavorful as the rest of the items  along with that  we did get complimentary dessert bowls  which i think are the fermented gluttonous rice dumplings on the menu  the dessert was hot  sweet  and a good way to end our meal  i can't wait to be back!
very great place clean and food tasty i being here 3time always excellent the dish are median size price are ok i fully recommond to come here try it they always busy and full seat i order garlic rib beef pancake drunk chicken and xo sauce duck was so yummy will come back again thank you for the delicious food
oh good lord the wait was a b**ch  but the steamed crab buns were worth the long wait  each bun is handmade and cooked on the spot  prices were reasonable  great service  traditional chinese food without any weird western twist  & a restaurant run by people who know what they're doing  with all the places to eat in flushing  this is a must try  sit back and relax for dinner  versus going to some food court overcrowded with annoying and loud people 
this place has amazing service and even better food! me and my dad loved this place while we were visiting ny  their soup dumplings were to die for  we were looking forward to those dumplings the most and we were definitely satified! we went there twice on our trip and we probably would have went a thousand times more if we had the chance  it's a must if you're in the flushing area 
a nice change from the other soup dumpling places in queens  as soon as you enter the restaurant you can see the workers making the dumplings  so far every time we've gone they have given one free order of soup dumplings and an dessert soup  decently priced everything!
food quality is good 4 to 4 5 stars   however  service is very very poor 1 star or even 0   they push very hard and bad and rush us to place food order even we have not yet sit down   kind of they force us to place order and attitude is really bad   we still waiting  my goodness! therefore  the average is 2 stars!
best soup dumplings and soft tofu dessert i tried so far    the place looks pretty new and clean    
the was my go to for shanghainese (for quality  & cheap eats)  i've been here a handful of times in the past year  & a half  over time  i noticed they raised the prices on some dishes; i accepted that  i went yesterday  & saw that the dishes were smaller  as well  i accepted that  the deal breaker came when i tasted the food  it was not as good as it used to be  i was w  2 friends  & they thought the same  they still have the free order of soup dumplings  but the waiter said i needed to buy 1  to get it  i think he was trying to upsell me  but i didn't press the issue  to sum up  you've lost my loyalty  & i have to find a new go to 
decent shanghaiese food and soup dumplings  nice decor but seating can be too tightly packed  the wait can be intimidating and full party has to arrive to be seated  good choice if you want shanghaiese and it is not too crowded 
i'll admit  i was hesitant to believe the 4 star review that shanghai you garden has received so far  nan xiang on prince street has always been my go to spot to satisfy my soup dumpling cravings  however after reading fellow yelper cynthia's review and seeing that shanghai you garden offers a free carton of 6 pork soup dumplings (free with a minimum order of $10 if you mention it as others have mentioned)  i knew i had to try it before the offer disappeared  between 3 people  we shared   scallion pancake with beef ($4 95)  crab and pork soup dumplings ($6 75)  pork soup dumplings (free)  braised bean curd ($4 95)  jellyfish with turnip ($5 95)  beef and chili pepper noodle soup ($7 95) thinking the portions would be comparable to nan xiang  we over ordered  making this a little too much food for 3 people  the highlights of the meal were the scallion pancake with beef  the crab and pork soup dumplings  and the braised bean curd  the scallion pancake came with 4 large pieces that were perfectly fried and crispy  surprisingly  it's not as oily as you would think compared to other places  the braised bean curd is a dish i wish i knew had to make  seasoned so well  you have to order this dish! if you love the outer layer of fried tofu  you'll especially appreciate this  i complained how this cold appetizer was a bit pricy  but my mom justified the price with the amount of work that goes into preparing this side dish  finally  the crab and pork soup dumplings were the juiciest and most flavorful soup dumplings i've had outside of din din in tapei  fight the urge and beware of biting into the dumpling seconds  even a minute after arriving   i assumed that they would be warm and went right into the dumpling and burned my tongue (a sign that these delicacies are prepared fresh); it was so worth it though  you can actually taste the crab flavor in these dumplings compared to nan xiang and joe's shanghai  the free pork dumplings were good as well  but the crab added another layer of flavor toppling over the pork dumplings  i recommend eating the soup dumplings first  while they're still hot as they're more enjoyable that way  i had 2 soup dumplings towards the end after they sat for awhile  so they cooled down completely at that point  it was still good and bursting with flavor  but it wasn't as good as it was hot  skip the the beef and chili pepper noodle soup  its massive size is the only impressive part  it's definitely a portion for 2 3 people  however  the noodles were bland and not spicy as advertised  my mom and i both compared the noodles to the packaged noodles you can just buy from the supermarket  also skip the jellyfish with turnip   it's literally a 90% 10% ratio of turnip to jellyfish  so essentially  you're paying $6 for turnips   no thanks  you also get free rice wine mochi dessert at the end  i wasn't a fan of this dish at all as it was heavily doused in rice wine  the mochi was soft and chewy though the only real compliant i have about shanghai you garden is their service  not saying that flushing has outstanding service  if that even exists  but i feel like shanghai you garden goes out of their way to really make you feel rushed  from asking numerous times if we're ready to order to watching your dishes almost empty  so they can come and scoop any remaining bits onto anyone's plate  so they can clear the table  to dropping off the check before you even ask to then picking up the check when you didn't even pay yet   all this made the dining experience a bit uncomfortable   i'd like to serve myself in peace  but hey  if you're busy and have a packed house at off hours like 5 6 pm  i can see why you'd like to turn tables over as quickly as possible 
45 minutes wait on a friday nightpretty much ordered everything on the menu  the four of us could not finish everything  but food quality was above average things i like the best   steamed dumplings with pork   legit and really good  pork shank   it was awesome! love the sauce as wellthings that are average   the soup noodles  the fried shanghai noodles  steamed pork bunsit was a great satisfaction when craving shanghai food and after ordering literally everything on the menu  the bill came out to be only $68  is this for real?i like how they give us a lot of free items   steamed dumplings with pork  dessert   sweet soup with mochi
this is my second time coming to this shanghai restaurant and i do plan on coming back  i love how they would give you a free order of pork soup dumplings on the first 10 dollars you spend  this time i came with a party of four people who weren't too hungry  we ordered a order of regular pork soup dumplings  braised pork leg  shanghai pan fried u don  stinky tofu and 3  soup buns  the shanghai pan fried udon came very fast and was delicious! next came our pork soup dumplings  and the individual soup buns  the braised pork leg and stinky tofu came last  the dumplings was juicy hot and fresh out of the steamer  the pork leg was so soft and flavorful  this is best with a bowl of warm rice  the stinky tofu wasn't as stinky when it's in front of you but it still tasted good with the sweet sauce  hot sauce  and kimchi  the individual soup buns were actually a bit disappointing  we expected it have some seafood or pork filling  but instead it was only a soup that tasted fishy  it came in a cute little bamboo steamer and a straw to drink the soup  overall  if you are looking to enjoy soup dumplings and authentic shanghai food  this is definitely a good choice  the decor here is beautiful and the price is just right!
when in queens  do as the queens yelpers do  so when anna h  mentioned a "very clean" chinese dumpling place  i was intrigued  and when she said her foodie mom was ordering up half the menu  i was compelled  shanghai you garden is indeed all she said  the place is very clean  with a bathroom that was only slightly messy considering the hungry hordes waiting outside and eating inside  you enter and pass the organized take out area  with the many trays of assorted chinese foods and the chairs all taken by the waiting crowd  be amazed by the clean window that separates you from the food  and the fact that there isn't food spilling from those trays in an unsightly manner  as you often see in chinatown dives   entering the main seating area  you are surrounded by walls beautifully decorated on one side with huge paintings of vases with i believe swallows on them  on the other side  smaller pictures of various flowers hang from the walls  elegant and colorful  this is new style wait staff  who greet you courteously and warmly  pre show dinners can be tricky  i don't want to eat too much i'll be burping  order too much i have to smell like chinese doggie bags all night because guilt trips over starving kids make me take leftovers  or order too little i will be too cranky to enjoy the show  i settled for the jelly fish appetizer and the vegetarian dumplings  the jelly fish was mixed with daikon  a clever way of stretching the jellyfish  and was crunchy and tasty  albeit a bit bland  i mixed it with the chili sauce and the sweet vinegary soy for my dumplings and amped up the tasty ratio  used to the garlic in cantonese cuisine  i sometime forget that the shanghainese will risk being vampire bait  preferring to be kissable after dinner  much better for my theater neighbors anyway  the vegetable dumplings were huge  perfectly shaped thin wrappers stuffed with a mixture of greens including napa  mustard and mushrooms  the taste was light and again  slightly bland perhaps because it wasn't heavily salted  the fresh taste of the veggies prevailed  roll each dumpling in the chili oil  pour some sweet soy  and life is a okay again   after your meal  you are served a portion of tong shui  a light and not overly sweet soup with small mochi  portions are ample for the plates  as i observed from seeing what other diners ate  i was stuffed after the jelly fish and the dumplings  shanghai you garden is a place i would try again and order the noodles or the specials  like the braised eel note  half of flushing seems to want to eat here and the line is literally out the door  come off hours or expect to wait a while also  if you are vegetarian  and you order more than $10($11?)  you will automatically be graced with an order of complimentary pork soup dumplings  if no one from your group eats meat  let the staff know up front   the  waiters seemed genuinely horrified that i didn't eat meat and didn't want their dumplings(which i can understand as diners seem to think they were excellent) and were terribly apologetic   you won't even need the yelp check in to get this though i don't know how long this will last 
upgraded the rating because there's no longer crazy waits and it turns out that they automatically give every table free soup dumplings with the order of $12 or more  d we ordered about $20 worth of food for two people and they also threw in free dessert again 
each dumpling was more delicious than the next  grab a few friends and go family style  be prepared to wait  get there early and get your name down
the food and service here was meh  nothing to rave about but it was edible  i found the hype of the xl soup bun to be overrated as it was literally just a tiny bit of crab meat infused in broth (not even a flavorful soup which is why i called it a broth)  after you used the straw to suck up the broth  there was no meat like normal soup buns and just a hollow bun left  not worth the try  the food that was served wasn't really hot and the wait staff cleaned items only when you asked them to  i have definitely been to better shanghainese restaurants 
we came here after the us open last sunday  everything is superb  we had two orders of soup dumplings  one pork  one pork + crab meat  amazing  best dumplings of any kind i've ever had  particularly the pork ones  we also ordered the cold duck in soy sauce and the fish belly in brown sauce  both dishes were excellent  they also provided us fermented gelatinous rice bowls for dessert on the house  which was a perfect ending  all in all  the best meal we had in ny last weekend 
came here for dinner tonight  it was a fun experience! their menu is in chinese & english  but if you aren't familiar with chinese dishes  it is hard to figure out  the server was nice enough to answer my many questions  their scallion pancake beef roll was really good! the scallion pancake was kind of flaky and fried crisp  i originally came here for the xl xlb  and it was so cute! the soup itself is a bit fishy (?) as in it had a strong seafood flavor (does that make sense) but the bao part was good  their prices are very cheap  we ordered 5 things and got an order of xlb for free  and the bill came out to $26 
this place is really convenient since it's only a short walk from the main st subway stop  i honestly have enjoyed all the shanghai style chinese restaurants i've been to so far in either chinatown or flushing so it's tough to really compare them  one spot has a superior soup dumpling but subpar rice cakes or an awesome layout with friendly staff and another didn't  that all being said  the food is what matters most and this place has really good food  it's convenient and delicious  there was a 15 minute wait to be seated on saturday at lunch which to me is always a good sign  items i'd order again  sliced beef scallion pancake ($5 6)  pork & vegetable wontons in spicy oil ($4 95)  and of course if you're into soup dumplings ($5 75)  this was one of the soup dumplings that ripped more easily than others so be careful when you pick em up!
terrible service  the waiters kept rushing us to finish and taking food away while we still eating and asking if we want to take it to go  we had a huge group of 11 and it hasn't been an hour yet but they already placed the bill on table  would not be going back 
our hotel  the hyatt place  is located about two and a half blocks from the you garden dumpling house   the front desk staff recommended we try the you garden  since we had already tried another restaurant for soup dumplings around the corner from them both were great restaurants   what made us walk a few blocks more was the yelp check in offer for a free order of steamed pork buns (soup dumplings )we were not disappointed   everything was excellent   when we arrived  we were informed that there would be a 25 minute wait   we were seated in line  inside  and were given a menu to look over while we waited   as the patrons were called for their tables  we moved up in the seats   plus  our order was taken   when we were seated our meals were immediately served 
the restaurant was quite busy on a late sunday afternoon but got seated promptly for a party of 2   the modern clean asian decor with a relaxing ambiance was a pleasant surprise by flushing standards the menu hosts a large variety of selections and we opted for the spicy beef and tripe  shredded chicken with rice cake  scallion pancakes and their main event    xiao long bao   it's as good as the best in the area   all the dishes were delicious at a great price   will visit again 4 5 stars for the food   minus points for the restrooms located right next to the storage area for the plates and utensils   a redo is in order to round up the experience 
3 stars for food  2 stars for service   i first thought the waiter was mute taking my orders   he was sarcastic and emotionless  other waiters just dropped plates on table  food was not bad but the service killed it   would i come back?  nope  plenty of good xlb places in nyc  no need to pay and get shitty service 
wow  excellent food  most of the items we ordered was so on point and yummy  this was my first trip to flushing​  ny  we ordered the pork xiaolongbaos buns (awesome pork soup dumplings) fungus ears  jellyfish (with radishes and other stuff  seriously so delicious)  cucumber with garlic  shanghai eggrolls (so crispy and perfectly flavored)  puffed green onion pancake (nice crispiness and seasoned with a bit salt)  chicken with wine sauce (good flavor but tough meat)  spicy beef and tripe (good flavor if you're into tripe)  and for dessert a warm 8 ingredient rice with red bean paste and fermented rice sauce (perfect   not too sweet)  the only items that i wasn't a huge fan of was the the chicken in wine sauce because even though the flavor was good  the white meat chicken was tough to eat  i guess we ordered too much for two people but we were starving!! no regrets overordering  i wish i ordered their fried croaker too  looked super yummy  by all the flavors from the dishes we ordered  i'll bet that one was a winner  too  we gulfed most of the food down before i took pictures! oops  i am definitely coming back 
i went there for 2ppl  we ordered crab meat steam bun  pork steam bun  beef tendon  deep fried fish and shao mai  every dishes we ordered tasted great and portion was very good!
can you say free xiao long bao? i can and i was able to get a free tray of soup dumplings by ordering $20+ of food  i loved the beef pancakes and my salted bean curd dishes  i will be back to eat all the food!
my wife and i went for lunch twice and the better time is before 11 30 am est (no wait)  otherwise it'll be about 15 45 min wait   foods are great and price is very reasonable   service is super fast and good   really enjoy the experience!!
came here on a weekday around 2pm and the place was packed  the wait was only less than 5 minutes  the place is new and clean  i don't know the name of the dishes we ordered as my parents did the ordering but i did provide pictures  ill work on the names for them  food was good and i would come back again  you get a complimentary order of soup dumplings when you order over $10   there's only one bathroom but you can use the bathroom across the street at corner 28 
4 5 starswe showed up at 2pm for a quick lunch since i had an appt in a different area later on in the day  it was packed  i think some diners were sharing tables in the front? only had to wait a few minutes and we got the same booth as last time  pretty nice    we had so much space for just the 2 of us  they rushed to clear the table and even swept the floor as well before we sat down  like i said the restaurant was completely full but that's great service  we received menus quickly and i told l to order whatever since i wanted to use the restroom  only took less than a minute wait time and it was very clean inside  have you seen the bathrooms in chinatown??? i know some are complaining about only 1 restroom but seriously tons of places only have 1    i've never had to wait long at all  l ordered the crab meat pork buns  braised meat ball with crabmeat  bowl of rice and a coke  we mentioned the free check in and our waiter was like yeah already knew about it   was going to add it   lolthe meatball and rice came after a few minutes  it was really hot  it's not something i'd choose  but it wasn't bad  it's like an asian meatloaf in ball form  it was really soft and not too salty  our xiao long baos came soon afterwards and wow   they were really good  even better than our first visit and better than the ones i've had in chinatown  better than nan xiang    really flavorful  plenty of soup  we did break 2 of the dumplings   so sad  so the skin was pretty thin  but i guess it's just not very consistent we were extremely full    l was actually planning on ordering more food in the beginning but we had dinner plans later on but we were full for the rest of the day and only needed a couple of snacks instead  none of the waiters rushed us and its great that they clear any sign of a empty plate really quickly  every waiter or waitress we interacted with spoke english well enough  no issues whatsoever  also l was the one who ordered and sometimes he might be a lil intimidated to order in a chinese restaurant but clearly all the staff are able to communicate in english  i always come here for xiao long baos   perhaps a noodle soup and one of their specials  stick with those items and you'll have a nice meal 
we were going to nan xiang  and forgot that it was saturday  the line to get in was long  not that i'm impatient  (i am)  but there are so many options in flushing  so we moved on  and we found you garden dumpling house  so  we won't be going to that other place anymore  lol  the soup dumplings crushed it  the other dishes were extremely good (fried bean gluten appetizer was off the hook  and i'm picky about my fried bean gluten)  and the check was under $20  this place is a find  maybe i shouldn't be writing this  my first instinct was to not tell anyone about it  so i don't see a line out front next time 
definitely coming back! dare i saw it's better than joe's?! came here on a saturday evening at 6 30pm and waited 20 minutes but the host was very gracious  he kindly sat us in a large booth up front because we had a baby  service there was quite professional  they offered a booster seat  food arrived timely  waiter was polite and other waiters checked on us  plus it's clean and modern food   pork soup dumplings (morsels of savory happiness)  scallion pancakes (flaky and delicious)  pan fried pork buns (pillowy bun with juicy pork center)  rice cake with shredded pork the portions are solid and there was a promotion on the soup dumplings   buy one get one free  which is insane but we'll take it!at the end of the meal  they give you a complimentary sweet soup  it's usually red bean but this had bits of mochi and was the best "sweet soup" i've ever had definitely coming back!
the food is just ok  as a native i think this is pretty average but you can't beat the price  don't really have any complaint  it was packed when we went to have brunch on a sunday  as expected  our food came out pretty fast because the waiter had asked us what to order beforehand  a plus side is they gave us free soup dumpling  not sure if it was a promo or but it was good  i wasn't thrilled when they put the check before i had asked but since it was really busy around that time so i let it go  the location is right across from lirr entrance exit on 40rd  overall  it would be a nice first time shanghai food tryout 
this place definitely lives up to its reputation! we got the pan fried pork buns  sautéed snow pea shoots  rice cake with shredded chicken  sweet soy bean curd  salted soy bean curd  fried crispy dough  and scallion pancakes  all phenomenal  and very reasonably priced  the fried pork buns were particularly good  so much more we wanted to try on the menu  but not enough room in our bellies  will definitely be back!
my first time out to flushing queens for asian food and this place was great! i saw its high stars and "hot and new" label and opted to call ahead for a reservation   called about 30 40 mins before arriving  we arrived later than the time we gave (parking is a struggle   street or parking garage$) and when we entered the restaurant at 8pm it was packed   the hostess was very friendly and honored our reservation  within ten minutes our party of 2 was seated  food was great  soup dumplings (savory and juicy)  pork dumplings  chicken mushroom fried noodles  tofu appetizer (class shanghainese dish   love it) and cold soy milk (very refreshing) and rice wine sweet soup balls on the house for dessert! because they need to get people in and out as fast as possible it's definitely a eat and leave place  loved every bite   filled my asian cravings 
amazing！as a shanghainess  i've been surprised by the taste of the food  even better than some of you could get in shanghai!葱油饼 豆沙酥 大推荐！咸豆花$1 5 真的是好吃便宜大份还有肉松和紫菜简直感动哭了！来不及尝其他好吃的，下次再去！
came here with two friends for dinner on a weeknight  it's a crowded little restaurant with awfully bright flouresant lighting  it's like a dentist office how bright it is inside  the food was mediocre to bad   ribs  shumai  soup dumplings  shanghai noodles  stirfry chicken  water cup also had a smudge of black grime near the rim (gross!)  at some point there was a whiff of sewage garbage odor that lasted across the tables for an hour  hoping it wasn't from the kitchen  but none of us could tell where else the smell was coming from! giving this restaurant the benefit of the doubt is hard  i recommend the many other dinner spots for better food!
super delicious soup dumplings! and their sweet tofu dessert ("to fu fa") is out of this world 
my new real shanghainese restaurant  this place definitely blows nanxing out the water with the traditional selection that they have  their food is super good and it feels as if i'm back in shanghai  i got 3 baskets of soup dumplings  1 giant soup dumpling  2 bowls of soy bean milk  fried dough  chicken  gluten  shu mai  and sheng jian bao  all that only came out to 45! food came out super fast and the waitresses were super nice  overall an amazing experience  will be keep coming back
oh those dumplings!  i love this place!great staff and great food!
solid soup dumplings here  they always throw in a free order too which is a plus  my favorite dish is the fried buns! go early as there's usually a wait 
i have been waiting for their giant xlb for over 20 min for take out  what the hell!! i am still waiting for just one steam soup dumpling? i don't care how it taste  it just won't worth my time 
the initial impression was nothing unexpected  this has been a pretty popular place ever since it opened so it was bound to be crowded  it was a busy friday morning so the wait for a table was about 20 30 mins  after being seated  you notice the environment as it has an authentic chinese traditional touch to it  luckily we were able to place our order in while we were still waiting for a table to minimize more downtime  we ordered a few things on the menu but of course had to get the soup dumplings  the soup dumplings were great especially the fact that they give you an extra order for free  i would say it's up to par with the other soup dumplings joints  we also wanted to see what all the hype was about regarding the enormous soup dumpling  full warning  it's extremely underwhelming  they give you a straw to poke a hole in and drink out of it  it's literally all soup and it didn't taste that great  i'd suggest sticking to the other stuff on the menu  btw bring cash  they don't accept card   overall food  greatprice  fairly priced competitive service  decent
i heard of this restaurant through the asian kitchen series on youtube  i was intrigued by the idea of drinking the soup out of a huge soup dumpling with a straw  i didn't end up ordering this  as i heard about the complimentary xiao long bao with all orders above $10  while the xiao long bao was ok  all the other dishes i had were rather underwheming  i tried   chives and egg stuffed pancake   pea shoots dumpling  a steamed vegetarian dumpling (with mushrooms  pea shoots  and chives  i think)  shanghai style mooncakes (stuffed with pork)  a green colored mochi that was dyed with spinach and filled with sweet red bean paste  drunken chicken  fried potstickersthe fried potstickers tasted quite ordinary  some of the skins were broken  and they were barely pan fried  at a taste of shanghai (another restaurant nearby)  they make an extraorinary fried potsticker  which is filled with soup! they manage to fry the bottom to a well browned crisp without breaking the skin (which would cause the soup to spill out)  that's skill! shanghai you garden's potstickers  on the other hand  were rather poorly executed the drunken chicken was tasty  as a good quality chicken was used  and i liked the heavy shaoxing wine flavor  the pea shoots dumpling looks very pretty  but is rather bland  it's stuffed mostly with pea shoots and underseasoned  the same can be said about the other vegetarian dumpling  i do appreciate vegetarian dumplings  but i've definitely had better  the chives and egg stuffed pancake was ok  but the crispiness came mostly from frying rather than the pastry being extraordinarily flaky  the shanghai mooncake is a flaky pastry wrapped around pork and preserved vegetables  tasty  but not extraordinary  same with the green mochi 
as for xlb goes  this place is better then most  i use to go to kung fu xlb on prince street as my go to but there's always a wait and service feels a bit rushed there   they have a deal going on where you buy 2 trays of soup dumplings  get the 3rd one free and this per table by the way  it's really roomie and luckily the two times i've been there i didn't have to wait  avoid rush hours cause the wait can be out the door  the giant soup dumplings was interesting but not my cup a tea  i had the expectation that there would be some sort of meaty filling like the regular size dumplings but it was all soup  good to try if you haven't had one before 
very good xiaoliangbao  the wait can be long  the food is a very good deal overall  place is a little small and crowded but taste makes up for it  nice service 
minus 1 star for being cash only and if i would have know they didn't accept credit cards  i would have gone somewhere else  over all the food was outstanding   the dumpling were super flavorful and the buy 2 and get one free deal made them taste even better   even though the special spare ribs w  garlic sauce looked great  but i wasn't a fan of the taste   the sauteed snow peas were amazing even better than the dumplings   the service was good  but not amazing   overall  i recommend this you garden 
good food  good location  love the buns and dumplings  good price and lovely interior  it shows chinese traditional culture in here 
the best soup dumplings i've had in new york  this place serves authentic shanghai cuisine  delicious food and great service! i will definitely be returning!
couple months ago  a few of my friends asked me if i eve tried the soup dumpling  the idea made no sense to me  like    do you mean  dumpling soup? like theres dumplings in the soup? yeah  but the friends go  "no dude  soup dumpling "    i couldn't comprehend because my friends just suck at describing stuff  until i got there it really was a soup dumpling  like  soup in a dumpling  instead of pork and stuff and such  try them! i was amazed by their soup dumpling  and tried to find other spots as great as this place  but kinda failed  i come here every now and then if i feel like getting some of that soup dumpling!yeah yo  cool place  but like  some things are just not exactly perfect   like they take 5 years to get our drinks  get tables      not too clean tables     waiters bumping into me while passing by without apology   but the food makes up for it i guess  lol
soup dumplings are my favorite foods  the price is reasonable and the food was so good i love the soybean sauce  it was delicious 
all i say is this place is cheap and good for its price when it is not crowded if it it crowded  stay away from it cuz u will have to wait a long time but other than that  only thing to complain is the waiters will ask for tips  i used to give 10 12%  and some of them insist on 15%  you aint got great service why should i give you that much   
this used to be my go to place for soup dumplings in flushing but my previous 2 times here have just a turnoff  today i came here around noontime and as expected there was a wait  as we waited to be seated  the girls took our order  we placed an order of pan fried pork buns to go with our dining in order so everything is in 1 order and there shouldn't be any excuses later saying the buns arent ready by the time we finish eating  we eat for about 40 mins  and the waiter hands over our check eveb though we clearly arent done eating  meanwhile  we still have gotten our to go order yet  i pay the check and ask him where the to go order is  to which he says he'll bring it out  he gets me the change for the bill and has yet to bring out my to go order which i already placed in the beginning and now the bill is already paid for  then he has the audacity to ask us to wait outside for the buns  i guess since they already got paid  there's no rush in giving us our order  we compile and wait in the front  by now its been 15 mins since we left the table and have been sitting in the front and no one has given us our to go order which we already paid for  on top of that  the waiter has an attitude when we asked about the status  if you didn't want to give us our order then refund us which they also didn't want to do  we had to speak to the lady manager who finally gave us our order  i seriously don't understand the issue  the order was placed an hour ago in the same dine in order and yet we still had to wait until after we were done eating  it's not like we added the order after we finished eating  and the attitude was unnecessary when it is clearly the restaurant's fault  will definitely not be back  there are other soup dumpling places in flushing 
great soup dumplings and fantastic service  the soy bean milk is very good also and every dish i've tried so far is great  prices are on the steep side but you get what you pay for here 
great food    amazing dumpling    service was fantastic    can't say enough good things about it
this place definitely serves some bomb soup dumplings  i went here with some friends  we ordered some dishes and were told that with any 15 dollar purchase we get a free soup dumpling  the dishes were amazing and the prices were better than fair  although it can be loud and a little cramp i didnt mind it at all!
i find it odd that the manager commented on my review saying it is as an "odd complaint"  a hygiene concerns should not be an "odd complaint"  if i see it happen again next time  i'll take a picture to show your establishment     but ohh wait    i will not be coming back here again  food is decent so the review will stand as 2 stars but in terms of service  its 0 stars   please note  there are many good asian chinese cuisines in flushing  there are options  7 13 2017  previous review service here is not great and a bit disgusting  i came here to eat with a friend and i noticed some unsanitary conditions that kept occurring  i came here around spring during the time of an allergy season and this waiter kept sneezing and rubbing his nose  then this waiter proceeds to pick his nose in front of customers then he would take plates to tables with his nose picking finger in their dish  this repeated for at least 6 dishes  i couldn't believe his fellow waiters or the other staff members didn't tell this waiter to stop picking his nose and go wash his hands before he goes deliver dishes to tables  this literally grossed me out and i will not be returning anymore  the waiter was fairly young  perhaps around his 20's  beware if you see him delivering your dishes 
i have not been back in flushing for many years  flushing always my go to place for food i ordered soup bun yesterday from this place  a total knock out  i want to clarify this  the soup bun i am talking about is xiao long bao  not the $2 99 individual bun with soup in there which is is sucks  for soup bun  this place is way better than joe's shanghai i will give 4 stars for now  i want to go back and try other dishes  1 day 
we ordered a few orders of scallion pancakes  soup dumplings and shanghai fried noodles  the soup dumplings were mediocre and nothing to rave about  the scallion pancakes were bland and mostly dough with specks of scallions  the shanghai noodles were bland and tasteless  i wont be dining here again as there are much better options around flushing for shanghai food  this place is overrated and i dont get all the positive reviews 
if you've had nan xiang  you've pretty much eaten here   i hear the owner is the same chef as that of nan xiang   the food almost tastes exactly the same but you garden has a larger menu and wider selection of dumplings the buy 1 get 1 soup dumplings make this place a great bargain 
they give you a free xiaolong bao when your order reaches $10  however  the food    i think they use way tooooo much msg  i kind of got food poisoning after eating there  i was extremely thirsty and my tongue felt numb for two days    never coming back
i ordered  1  chicken ginseng soup  good ginseng flavor2  two crab soup dimpling   thin skin with flavorful meat and soup3  beef noodle soup with green peppers  very good4   sweet soft tofu  tofu was silky smooth with just enough honey for sweetness we actually ordered one order of crab soup dumplings but they gave us the second for free as a promotion   we also got rice wine sweet soup with mochi for free too  i loved everything i ordered  this is going to be the new frequent spot for me to go to for soup dumplings 
awesome food at very reasonable prices  just gets very crowded and not enough seating 
i was looking forward to try this dumpling place as they serve many dishes i had in shanghai  china in the past  i wanted to get that authentic taste again from shanghainese cuisine restaurant located on 40th road in flushing  smelly  narrow  road with lots of traffic  decoration of the restaurant is fairly new and bright  wait wasn't long for party of 5  booth was comfortable we ordered a good mix of dishes  all fairly oily but with very good taste 
if you spend $10 and more  you get a free order of 6 steamed pork buns  how awesome is that! i came here more than 3 times already  which is pretty impressive considering the xiao long bao competition in flushing  wait is usually 10 20 minutes in the afternoon  price ranges from $14 (for three dishes) to $50 (serving 6 people) which gives this place another plus! their crispy scallion pancake is just as good as nan xiang xiao long bao  but the best is their hot sweet soy bean which gives off the strong flavor of soy bean  i also recommend their braised fish belly in brown sauce  i do not recommend their rice cakes with vegetables because it is a bit bland  i would certainly prefer this place over dimsum (although their black tea taste like water) 
note   if u order siomay u have to know the siumai is not like regular other dimsum place but the siumai is more look like "lo mak kai" sticky rice wrap in wonton skin personally i dont like it at all ( based on me) the rest of the food that we ordered is just ok nothing special but the price is a bit pricey
love this place! the food is good and the price is cheap  usually order the typical soup dumplings plus other stuff  this time we ordered their viral hit the giant soup dumplings  well    it literally was just a giant dumpling with soup inside with no meat! other than that  their food has been consistent and yummy
i seldom gave five stars  but this place has the best shanghainese place i can find in nyc  have been here twice and tried dim sum and several cold or hot dishes  overall the dishes i had were above average  and some were even amazing  highly recommend pork belly and soup dumplings  it also has some traditional shanghai dim sum  like meat mooncake and qing tuan  will try these next time 
shanghai you provides a true delicacy! the soup dumplings were splendid  i couldn't stop eating! i thoroughly enjoyed their sweet and sour pine cone fish  it had a perfect balance  the staff were working hard and i can't wait for my next visit 
we only had the soup dumplings and the crab and pork ones were amazing  they had very nice and attentive staff which is relatively unusual for flushing and the fact that you get an order of soup dumplings for free is also pretty sweet  their soup dumplings are just a touch bigger than the ones from nan xian 
needed to find a place in flushing with the right price or clean  quick  and delicious food  for $22 54 the two of us ate like kings! fresh ginger tea  12 soup dumplings (thanks yelp)  scallion pancake  udon noodle dish with pork and baby bok choy  cucumber and garlic sauce  this is a good place to bring a group or those new to flushing  impressive decor and friendly staff  most important cash only! loved this! i'll be back  )
i have to say this is the best shanghainese restaurant in n y   amazing soup dumpling and appetizer but horrible customer services especially the short hair waitress really nasty attitude
good substitute if you're tied of nanxiang  cheaper since they gave you free buns when you order one  down side is most of the dishes are too oily 
the soup dumplings were good  the regular ones weren't any better than nan xian  the crab soup dumplings had more flavor than nan xian though  as for the other dishes we tried  everything was on the sweet side  we had the following  cucumber and garlic  good but like i said sweet  spicy beef and tripe  best of the cold dishes we ordered   spicy bamboo shoots  good  wasn't very spicy for those who are afraid  also on the sweet side   scallion pancake w beef slice  we ordered but it never came  we didn't realize it until we were home  hopefully we weren't charged   noodle with scallion sauce  yummy  it was a good break from all the sweet flavors  i think it's just soy sauce and some sesame oil mixed with fried scallions and dried shrimp   grandma style braised pork  good but sweet  don't remember the name of the dish but it was fried fish covered with a ketchup sauce and pine nuts  also sweet  lol stinky tofu  stinky indeed  we got it because we thought my sister in law liked it  i had stinky tofu in taiwan and hong kong and enjoyed it so i thought hey  why not  it was super stinky! couldn't eat more than one but maybe you'll like it   )service was okay 
this is a nice looking place with lovely people in the front making dumplings that are quite good    the rest of the food is very disappointing 
food was excellent   service was excellent and the place was big enough where we weren't sitting on top of each other!
that was a good soup dumpling  the review was right better than nan xiang   and the cooking of the rice cake was absolutely the best  no one could beat it  so i'll be back  6 24 16 soup dumpling too salty   pork chop with noodles no good the porkchop was no good at all  i think they change chef already   not going back any more !
soup dumplings were excellent and authentic  we've visited yuyuan garden in shanghai and the food here was as good as any we had in china  staff is delightful 
the soup dumplings were good  but joe's shanghai   is still a better option in the area 
i hardly like to one star places  but this restaurant gets on my nerves  i came here with a large party of 10+ and was actually pretty excited to try the soup dumplings  the waiter that helped us was very strange  he did not came around to me and ask what i wanted or what my cousin wanted on the menu  i was flipping through the menu and decided that i was going to get some stir fried noodles  but the waiter did not even acknowledge me  very rude  thank god my mom helped me order this big soup dumpling otherwise i would starve  at a restaurant lol  although the presentation is nice  it was not good  there is only soup inside  and the soup taste literally like salted water  i tried my best to want to like it  but sadly i couldn't  besides that  the whole time i can sense all the waiters and waitresses eyeing us  and we felt like they were trying to rush us out asap  i did not feel welcome here so this would obviously be my last time here 
i was there yesterday with my parents for my birthday  it was my second time dining there and it did not disappoint! this is my favorite chinese food spot! i'm usually not a big fan of restaurants in flushing as most of them are loud and dirty  and wait staff are either rude or don't speak english  you garden is clean  and staff are efficient and attentive  best of all  the food is to die for! we had pork soup dumplings  vegetable steamed dumplings  croaked fish  steamed chicken  duck soup and sautéed eel e everything was absolutely delicious and cheap! i told my friends who wouldn't otherwise come to queens for a meal that they must come here to experience authentic chinese shanghainese food! will definitely be back again!
i came here to try their soup dumplings for free  but it turned out that they require you to spend at least $10 to have a free one  this contradicts with what is on yelp  "check in" to revive a free one  seriously  if you are not willing to give away  just don't put this offer on yelp  i order the soup dumplings  three of them were ruptured due to the fact that five dumplings were stick together    shredded gingers were presented in uneven sizes and were not as thin as those in nanxiang dumpling house  with this similar price  i can go somewhere else for a better quality 
we've come here 3x already   excellent xiao long bao   buy one get one free    cannot beat that   nice thin skin with piping hot soupy filling   staff is friendly and the best part is  the tables seats are nice and roomy and you are not crammed on top of others (like what they do at nan xiang dumpling house)   we're so happy we found another location with these soup dumplings that equal the quality and taste of joe's shanghai 
we were here on saturday for lunch  a long lines for waiting   the waiter took our order while we were waiting   i don't need to show my yelp free dumpling and the waiter knows and get me a free soup dumpling   food was good   the soup dumplings were great very hot and i like their app   overall it was a great meal   service was good   just need to be patience for waiting 
my husband and i love this restaurant   the food is delicious and service is pretty good   lots of waitstaff   their process is also pretty organized when they are super busy   they take your order while you wait for a table and queue you up   by the the time you get a table food starts arriving    if you order over $10 you get a free order of pork dumplings   pretty cool   i have been back several times already!
i have been here twice  the quality of the food is fresh  the noodles with pork barely had any pork in the dish  the eel in hot oil is plentiful and tastes great  the soup dumplings are great and the fried dumplings were worth the 15 minute wait!
really cheap but i had to wait in line  sooo many people its really cheap but food actually taste rly rly good  especially the dumplimgs
the dumplings are good  but stay the fuck away from anything chicken on their menu  cause they serve it undercooked with its damn wings still flappin'  it will leave you with a shitty week of food poisoning that won't let you shit solid for the next month  not to mention  rude customer service  shitty ambience and a floor plan that makes no sense i'd suggest you save yourself the suffering and stick to going to nan xiang 
i had a very bad experience with this restaurant today  i ordered the soup dumpling as my lunch  when i opened it  i saw a mosquito right on the dumpling     unbelievable  i called the restaurant and told them what happened  they transferred me to their restaurant manager  the manager apologized to me and told me i shall discard the dumplings right away and they will deliver a new and good one to me in 15 mins   i waited about one hour!!! other than that  the food is cold   if you can  avoid this restaurant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
great dumplings  priced very good! my go to spit! try the pork belly! yum yum! their home made sauce is amazing  but you have to ask them for it!
food was super yummy and well priced! the soup dumplings were very flavorful  i highly recommend the tendon appetizer dish because it was light and tasty 
i love the fried dumplings  wonton soup  beef with peppers  and shanghai noodles here! always cooked to perfection!
super yummy!!!!my bf and i came here on a friday afternoon we ordered crab soup dumplings  preserved veggies and noodles  rice cake  shanghainese mini buns and tofu with salted egg and shrimp then cold dishes from up front crab soup dumplings  yummy!!! lots of crab that you can visually see and so juicy and they're large and they give a free order or their regular soup dumplings so its like 2 for 1  preserved veggies pork with noodles  soup itself was amazing  not too salty  large portionrice cake   amazing wok flavor  my bf loved it  they dont skimp on the veggies and meatshanghainese mini buns  very juicy and large  there were 6 in an order  tofu w  salted egg and shrimp  omg so good  would def again  they used the japanese egg tofu  the saucefor the dish was basically a salted egg sauce (but not too salty) and there were peas with a good number of decently large shrimp  cold dishes  beef tendons were eh  wouldnt get it againwine chicken  bf liked it a lot   it did have good flavortofu with mushrooms  fav dish here  great marinated flavor jelly fish  not that great  iddnt have much flavor to it overall  i will be back 
one of my favorite go to place! love it  the soup dumplings are very tasty  instead of the dumpling with full soup  specially for the crab dumping  super delicious! the price is reasonable  the staff are nice  and the place is clean! it's always busy in shanghai you garden 
wow!  xlb with a yelp coupon of an extra tray if you spend more than $10   the service is quick and the place is clean   on this street  that says a lot   the decor is modern   expect crowds during rush periods   don't be stupid and come in expecting to be able to seat large groups easily   plan on at least 2 trays of xlb per person   haven't had a chance to try other food here yet but i'm looking forward to it 
had a great experience here   amazing food and great service in terms of the service  i want to add that my dining companion and i ordered some items that we didn't quite know how to eat and the service staff was very helpful and gracious in instructing us 
went with friends  it's a pretty diverse group  english only guys  vegetarian  and carnivore  i was initially concerned about it  because i wasn't sure they would be able to meet all our needs  but they did a great job  we did have a reservation  but still  we waited a solid 25 min just to get a table  they won't let you start your waiting sequence until everyone in your party is present  so if one person is late  you can't go in  but they have a guy taking orders outside  so when you are seated  your food is cooked or almost cooked  they have a very large selection of food  and you can find just about anything from breakfast to dinner  their portions are big enough for a group of 4 sharing  so it's worth the price  service was ok  but i am sure it's due to the large amount of people in there  if they can have a better system to let people in  and not worried about one person not present  i would give them a 5 star 
my friend told me about this place and we had dinner there the other day  very nice place  service was surprisingly friendly which is rare in flushing  they have a check in offer for the soup dumplings  but at the restaurant they tell you about it so you don't have to check in  it's $10 minimum order to get the free dumplings which is easy peasy  we ordered the cucumber app  fried pork & chives bun  crispy noodle with seafood & meat  plus the free dumplings  it was a lot of food for two people and we had leftovers  everything was very good  soup dumplings were pretty awesome  there was even free dessert (tong shui aka chinese sweet soup) at the end  definitely recommend this place  and will come again with family 
best soup dumpling hands down! this place serves authentic shanghai cuisine  nice interior  decent price  will return!
i came here for lunch during weekday  couldn't believe that the restaurant was full of customers ordered  steamed crab meat & pork buns  steamed veg dumplings  chicken in wine sauce  fried bean gluten  rice cake w shredded pork and deep fried yellow croaker w dried seaweed  we received free steamed pork buns!!!i personally love bean gluten and croaker dishes  the bean gluten was not in oily  the favor was rich  croakers were in fillet  no bone  good for elderly and kid  however  crab meat buns' taste weren't strong  i preferred many crab roe in a bun overall  it is recommended to try this restaurant  the best is dishes are not in strong msg 
i feel this place is the best shanghai food in nyc  the food is even more authentic than some restaurants in shanghai  highly recommend to go!
was there for mother's day 2016  crowded as could be  i was one of the very few white americans there [my wife is chinese]  i wanted to leave and the man in charge came over and spoke english to me and said to please wait a few more minutes  i laughed and asked what is a few minutes  he replied "about 10"  i said okay and sure enough it wasn't more than 10 minutes he showed us to out table  the food was excellent  noisy place but that's flushing 
my family and i came here after passing by the restaurant  we always see them busy and decided to try it  there is very little parking on the block where the restaurant is located  when we arrived there was a slight wait but the wait was worth it  we got an assortment of noodles and plenty of soup dumplings  the noodles were hot and delicious  the soup dumplings were flavorful  all the food was at a great price  the waiter suggested that i get the personal soup dumpling that comes with a straw  the dumpling was ok it had fish in the middle  overall i would suggest you garden the food was great the waiter were accommodating and helpful 
we went to flushing to see what their dumplings were like compared to nyc chinatown  we picked the second placed shanghai you garden it's on a small side street parallel to lirr station and up block from the mall  easy to pass and when you enter we weren't sure to go upstairs or to make a left  make a left through the glass door into narrow yet modern restaurant  try using a gps  but then it may interfere with the navigation systems of the noisy jumbo jets flying over your head  stick with the address   but what is with these " " in the address? threw my gps for a loop we arrived just before 5pm expecting to see the hordes but we were seated immediately  but while were seated and after dinner the place was mobbed with a huge wait  not good for groups unless you can make advanced reservations   not sure you can  mostly two and four person tables here this place is all about the shanghai dumpling   and of course with other items on menu  the prices are great compared to what other restaurants are charging in the same hood  six soup dumplings for $3 95   that is incredible for a restaurant price (other dumplings started at $6 95 or so which included shrimp and or crabmeat) we ordered shui mai  pork dumplings and an udon noodle dish with beef  we would have also ordered the fried dumplings but the waiter told us it would take 10   15 minutes  what? must not be a popular item there so we passed on it  the shui mai is nothing like we've ever seen nor had before  mostly sweet or stick rice (small grains) with minced pork  we thought this was dry with pork over cooked (burned)  it was not very tasty and too much dry tasting rice  we won't order this again  for all we know it could have been used as mortar to hold bricks together now  the dumplings   soupy as promised  tasty  but nyc chinatown has got these beat  nevertheless they were tasty and what it should be  what put us into cardiac arrest was we ordered three dishes we got four  we thought they gave us something we did not order so i called the waiter over to make sure we weren't too hungry when we ordered and went over the top  to our amazement he said something about the second set of dumplings (6 per set) was free because of our order  now he said that either in chinese or mumbled  for this reason i have no clue why it was for free but i learned never question a gift horse the udon with beef was extremely tasty  the beef (shredded) and noodles took on the same flavor  this was the best of everything we had  i've had better noodles in china but the sauce and beef really made up for the noodle not being spectacular you get lots for a great price  food is better than okay (except shui mai)  service is in abundance  oddly  it seemed there was one waiter waitress for every table but you still had to call them over if you needed something typical of low budget asian restaurants  their restrooms need some tlc and lots of air freshener   i mean lots  perhaps they may want to hire the tidy bowl man to give them a freshening up every few hours i can see why they were packed  it's like going to a all you can eat and stuffing yourself until the waiter asks if you care for a dinner mint and then just wait for you to explode if you're looking for dumplings in flushing you can't go wrong with this little spot  but i have yet to explore the other dumpling houses there to compare  so until then   bon appetite!
did i just got in in a bad day? the soup dumpling skin was thick  and the remaining dishes tasted the same  m   s   g    be prepared to drink 5 gallons of water after the meal
this establishment has very high reviews and that might've been the reason why i was expecting more from it  i have to say that the inside of the restaurant is decorated very nicely for a place that's located in the heart of flushing  there was also a good amount of seats for customers who have to wait a bit for a table (if you're unfamiliar with restaurants in flushing  most of them require you to stand there awkwardly in front of people who are eating inches away from you when you wait for a table)  it was a full house today around 1pm but the wait for a table for two people didn't take more than 10 minutes or so  we ordered the steamed crab meat pork buns  beef and chili pepper noodle soup  scallion pancakes and got the steamed pork buns for free with the yelp deal (the offer is only valid for dine in orders of $10 or more)  both types of pork buns were good  very flavorful but i found that the crab meat pork buns punctured very easily as i tried to lift them up out of the tray causing the soup to leak out before it made it to my spoon (so sad   )  the beef and chili pepper noodle soup was probably my favorite dish  it's definitely better than the one i've tried at nan xiang but i wish it had more beef   and peppers lol  the scallion pancakes would've been perfect if the bottom three pieces weren't overly fried  ( i did appreciate how it seemed less oily than most of the other ones i've tried at other restaurants  needless to say  i was a little disappointed but being part shanghainese  i have very high expectations of restaurants that advertise themselves to specialize in these dishes  another thing i didn't really like was how the steamed pork buns were just placed on the counter after they were ready to be brought out to the tables  the counter is pretty much located in the area that people need to walk past in order to come in and leave  there's nothing wrong with that if it's taken right away  but if it's left there for a few minutes  and you have all these customers just walking back and forth  is that even sanitary? a divider would definitely help i would probably still come back again to try the other dishes  i saw people at other tables order some chicken dish  which looked yummy  maybe that would be something better to try out 
my new favorite soup dumpling spot  my mom and i are regulars here during our weekly lunch dates  there's a lot of competition in flushing with all the new trendy restaurants popping up every other day  but this place is legit  the most important component of a shanghainese restaurant is how well they make their xlb  and their's are on point  the skin is thin  but not too thin that it rips when you attempt to pick it up  the broth inside is rich  porky  and not too oily or salty like some other places are  i've never had a soup dumpling that didn't have a spoon full of soup  nothing is more disappointing than opening that bamboo lid to discover some of your dumplings are deflated and soupless  the best part? if you spend more than $10 there  your xlb are free! my other regular items i order are the turnip puff  flaky pastry filled with shredded turnip  my fave! the pan fried pork buns are also some of the best i've had since my visit to shanghai  the decor is also very welcoming and clean  for the two of us  our bill usually comes out to $20 at most  so worth it! i almost don't want to give a good review because there's always a wait  but good food is good food 
great location to get a quick  cheap xlb meal  they offer free streamed pork buns by showing the yelp coupon  which is already a great reason to visit  we ordered the fried pork buns and the fried pork ribs with gravy  all of the dishes were great but i especially liked the ribs (5 5)  the fried buns had a bit too much breading but the flavor is solid (3 5 5)  the free steamed pork buns aka pork xlb is solid with thin skin  good broth and delicious meat  my only complaint was that they overdid it with the ginger in the filling and it covered up the wonderful flavor of the broth (4 5)  the place is affordable and a great addition to flushing 
im quite a fan of this place  sure  the soup dumplings arent as great as joes shanghai  but the other foods including breakfast  the soy milk  and dim sum foods are really good  also   one order of pork soup dumplings is always free!! my dad loves coming here solely for the free soup dumplings   i would also recommend the scallion pancakes and rice cakes  overall  the food here is solid  **** the one complaint i have is the last time i went  they forgot our pan fried pork buns until after we asked for the check  instead of comping it for us  they insisted we just pay for it and take it to go  my parents were cool with it  however  the manager should make it clear to the staff that customers shouldnt be forced to take things to go merely because the waiters forgot to bring us the food in time  ***
a clean and pleasant chinese restaurant with authentic shanghai small dishes at attractive price in flushing chinatown  it is now not as crowded as when it was opened  they still generously offer complimentary steamed xiaolongbao and sweet soup as dessert  both are transitional in shanghai  service were good  be aware it is cash only just as any new york authentic restaurants 
once again very delicious food ;) no complain at all!!!so i ordered a lot takeout and catch a plane back to charlotte  awesome food delivery  ) will do it again 
eight treasures in hot sauce is too salty，dont try shanghai special chicken was overdone 
killer dim sum for the lover of soup dumplings
i've been going to nan xiang dumpling house in flushing for years  finally i've found a superior soup dumpling at shanghai you garden! the food is fresher  lighter  and more finely crafted  also the scallion pancakes are fried to crisp perfection  not over fried like they do at nan xiang 
really bad service  push back and forth  if they have zero star i would  just want to behave customer arrange whatever they like and don't listen what customer want 
was happy to find this place on yelp  had the complimentary soup dumplings when you check in through yelp  ordered the porkchop noodle soup  the pork was very tender  had the shrimp dumplings too and it was plump and made fresh  also had the scallion beef pancakes and the shanghai udon  the place is clean  the seating is comfortable and service is prompt  would definitley go back and bring my friends and family 
this place has taken my #1 spot for soup dumplings! the skin is soooooo thin and the inside is so juicy   $5 95 for 6 buns  free on the house if you order $10 worth of food  we also ordered the braised deep fried pig hoof that was melt in your mouth tender as well as a chicken pan fried noodle that tasted pretty typical  prices are cheap and reasonable  service was mediocre  staff could be friendlier  i could definitely overlook that to come back for some yummy noms!
my friends love the place so much  it's like $34 for three of us  we love eating here  the buns are different from nanxiang (i personally prefer the nanxiang ones) and the 上海粗面 is better here than nanxiang's 
this place was very good  best shanghai buns i have had  i had both the crab and pork ones and the soup from them was very tasty and savoury  i will be coming back  the restaurant itself was very clean and decorated beautifully  it has asian paintings all over the place and there is ample seating  in the end i was gifted a soup in which i don't exactly know the name of but it contained eggs rice and doughy bits that were very chewy  it was sweet but a nice finisher to my meal  they also have an opening promo where they give you a free order of shanghai buns  to sum up my review shanghai buns are amazingdecorated beautifullyample seating nice and cleanopening promoi will come back again!
clean airy and bright  no unwanted smell  their speciality a are the soup dumplings   i par with joe shanghai
thumbs up!! went here for dinner earlier tonight  there was a bit of a wait for a table of 5  but i don't think we waited longer than 10 15 minutes  the waitress was super nice and took our order while we waited  she even gave us the free order of steamed soup dumplings without us mentioning about the yelp deal! once we sat down at our table  our food came immediately so that was a plus since we were in a bit of rush  i felt that the noodle portions were pretty big too  food was very good! we had the shanghai udon  rice cakes with chicken  2 orders of soup dumplings  scallion pancakes with and without beef  fried buns and tofu  great food and great company we will definitely be back 
in soft opening  this replaced the $5 box lunch space  operated by the owner of corner28  the menu is filled with the he ubiquitous shanghainese options  crab dumplings are good with need to be placed in a bigger bamboo steamer as the dumplings stuck to each other when expanded from the steam  spacious and service is efficient  it's a nice sit down restaurant that you could hold a conversation and thoughtful dishes 
thank chinese jesus  i've finally found amazing dim sum in nyc!  came to flushing to fight a red light bicycle ticket at the traffic courthouse down the street and happily wandered into you garden for breakfast after i finished   i won the case if you were wondering   two wins actually  since i found this place   for breakfast  you must try the scallion pancake with sliced beef   dumplings were beautiful little baskets of love   service was excellent   will come back with more people and order more in the near future   thank you you garden!  full and happy!
hot soy milk is a must get!  soup dumplings were great too   buy 1 get 1 free! fair warning    the wait can be very long! went with a group of 6 and waited for 40 minutes on a sunday afternoon 
their beef pancake is the best that i've ever eaten  even on a diet  i had to save all my calories one day to travel 30 minutes to get one takeout beef pancake    and eat the whole thing in one sitting   nan xiang dumpling houses' beef pancake has more beef but i don't even look that direction any more after having this beef pancake  the scallion pancake is incredibly crispy  flaky and not dripping with grease  they can use a more beef in the beef to scallion pancake ratio but that's all i can ask for yes  i ate a lot of the other stuff here   xiao long bao  wuxi spare ribs  fried yellow croaker  turnip puff  braised pork shank  noodles   but they were all forgotten after i had the beef pancake 
very authentic shanghainese food and free xlb with purchase  the veggie chicken reminds me of something i had 30 years ago   lots of cheap  small dishes  $50 60 will feed 4 people easily couple of minor things 1  they could use some better tea2  the gap between booth and table was too wide  i almost had to reach out every time the shop rite mat was hilarious probably same owner as corner 28 since they use their bags 
we reserved a table for 7 however we were not let in until all 7 people arrived at the place  we waited for a little  we checked in on yelp and had a free tray of xiao long baos  they were good! the chicken was rubbery and hard for the chicken wine brewed? cold platter   the saucey red pork was a bit too sweet for my taste  they included quail eggs in that dish which was good  we had a dessert on the house  it was this egg drop soup thingy with tangyuan and some hint of alcohol in it  it tasted so good!
very authentic shanghainese food! pleasantly surprised  it's very crowded on a saturday morning  mainly all shanghaineses  my parents and i waited about 20 mins before we were seated  the place is clean  the dishes they have are typical shanghainese like salty soft tofu soup  pork soup dumpling  rice cake with fermented veggies  one thing in happy about is that they don't rush you like some busy restaurants do  oh yea  they are doing promotion  you get 6 pork soup dumplings for  free if you purchase 10 dollars or more  overall  it's 6 8 per dish  so it is not one the cheaper restaurants in flushing but worth it for the good taste 
while i'm hesitant to write a bad review for any restaurant because i truly understand how hard it is to run a restaurant  i had to let this one out and i'll keep it short  my wife and i got seated at 9 10pm  all the dishes (appetizers  entrees  deserts) came at the same time at around 9 25pm  the waiter came with the check and their complimentary soups at 9 40pm  just let that sink in    at this point  we were nowhere near finish and they actually took away my plate while i was still working on my food  and the waiter even had the audacity to ask me if i was done  wtf!!! don't you see me chewing on this tasty rib (their ribs are pretty good  forgot what they are called)  anyway  their xiao long bao was flavorful and juicy but i wouldn't say the best in the area  i think most people come to this place because they have this special promotion going on where if you spend over 10 bucks you get an order of xlb for free  i hope the management of this place can take notice of their service and improve on that because their food is pretty decent in flushing standards if you are one of those people who don't like to read long review  my advice would be to skip this place and head straight to kung fu xiao long bao that's right next to the route 495  it's easier to find parking over there and the service is about 85 times better than this place 
i am a shanghainese and this place just reminds me of my childhood! this is the second best shanghainese food i found in america  service was great because the waiters and waitresses actually speaks shanghainese  and the price is so affordable  one more important thing to mention  it was hot in the restaurant so i kept fanning myself  but a few mins later someone actually turned on the ac! it is amazing that people pay attention to your needs without asking! it definitely deserves a 5 star rating from me 
well  the food is okay but extremely slow  i wait at least for 30 min for my buns  besides  it is crowded and the service is terrible 
the service was great here! the food was not bad  the exterior of the  steam dumplings felt a bit dry and not too moisturized but the soup base makes up for it  the fried fish appeitzer is delicious! but watch out because some has bones in them  if you come here  you must try the chicken soup they have (it's on the last page of the menu)  it taste like homemade soup
delicious soup dumplings! the one free order of pork soup dumpling promotion is awesome too (  the broth is very flavorful and the dumplings are big  the servers seemed nice and the place is new clean  and has nice decor first time  had to wait 30 minutes for a table of 3 on a weekend afternoon  second time  we had no wait since we came at 1130am on a weekday  but shortly after  there were people lining up definitely coming back
my friends love it here  i personally think it's just okay  i'm not a fan of xiao long bao so i ordered the shang hai fried udon noodle and it was sooooo oily  so bland  there was no way i can finish it  service is poor  after we ate  the servers some how lost our checks and we waited 30 minutes to be checked out 
my family of 7 came here on a monday night for a small celebratory dinner  they have a somewhat big table in the front of the restaurant which can fit about 6 7 people comfortably  all other seating within the restaurant seems to be booth seating or small tables the food here is pretty on point  we ordered a variety of dishes from their menu and had a lot of leftovers  i've starred my favorites below  ones not starred were not my favorites but did not taste bad; i just didn't like them as a personal preference thing bean & pig trotter soupchicken soupchicken in wine sauce*   great flavor in the chicken  which is important in this dish spicy beef and tripeshanghai style udon noodlerice cake with shredded pork*steamed crab meat and pork buns*   great crab flavor  soup was not overwhelmingly "sticky" like joe's shanghai can be  filling and skin ratio was good sauteed tofu with salted preserved egg yolk and shrimp*   i've gotten to really enjoy these new dishes that use slated preserved egg as a flavor enhancer  this was hands down my favorite of the night  tofu was soft and silky  even my 4 year old loved it deep fried yellow croaker with dried seaweed*   not oily  very fresh and tasty fishbraised fish belly in brown saucecurry casserole potthe service was sort of slow; the servers rarely came to check on us even though the restaurant was not super busy  being that we were the only table in the front of the restaurant i suppose they did not think to come and check on us we received one free steamed pork bun with our order  they churn out the buns pretty quickly  at least on monday night with medium level of business  we asked them to stagger the buns as we ordered 4 (+1 free so 5) the decor is very modern and a nice change from all the typical "chinese" restaurants on the same block i am definitely looking forward to coming back and trying their pan friend buns  fried bun with chives and egg and scallion pancakes 
had some dim sum plans cave in on us so we decided to hit up shanghai you you wouldn't look twice walking down the street in flushing  you've seen one restaurant  you've seen them all  and the facade looks just the same  but when you enter  it's zippy  clean  beautiful  a bit of an oasis on 40th road we were seated immediately  menus and hot tea ready to go  service is extraordinary  the menu isn't super extensive for dim sum  but they have plenty of entrees  we ordered the pan fried pork dumplings and the steamed pork buns  so different from most of the dim sum places around the way  heavy  almost bread y but were definitely worth it  we ordered udon noodles and beef noodles to round everything out  the menu does lack a lot of the delicacies like spicy jellyfish or even pork buns  but the food is choice  absolutely would come back to this spot 
came here on the saturday of the mother's day weekend around 6 20pm and there was already a line out the door   we got a number and they said about 15 20 mins   we waited 50 mins for a table for 4   luckily we stuck around and didnt cave into my wife's complaining about the long wait    she's the one who suggested the place!the seating was very spacious   they dont try to cram as many people into the place like at joe's shanghai   we ordered 2 crab and 1 pork soup dumplings a (free pork soup dumpling)  rice cakes with veggies and pork    special spare ribs  general tso's chicken (lapse in judgement on our part) and snow pea tips   everything was delicious   the soup dumplings were very juicy and i would say a decent size   the snow pea tips were a little old but still very tasty  everything came out quickly and was nice and hot   after dinner they served a glutinous ball dessert soup on the house   my mother even enjoyed the food   and you know how picky mothers can be!the only con i could report on was the single co ed bathroom which was not very clean at all 
if you don't speak mandarin or any relations that sounds like it  good luck! granted to miscommunications  let's get on with the review! food was good and the deal can't be beat  we ordered 2 orders of the yummy goodness of the soup dumplings and got 1 for free! yes  even though you checked in and it says you get a free order of soup dumplings  doesn't mean you go in and just cop that and bounce! that's not how business works! *hint*hint*  the dumplings were good  reasons  weren't these the same ladies that use to work down on prince st !? didn't expect a line for it  just because they switched places!? well this little spot is own by the infamous rice boxers from across the street! corner 28  i think they're monopolizing that area !? congrats to them  reasons why i gave it 3 stars is cause  we asked 4 waiters about an order we had that never came  they shook their heads as if they were going to get it  but simply ignored and went on to their own tasks  another star down cause of one of the servers gave a bit of an attitude when we simply only wanted an additional minute before ordering! be nice! but overall food was good! hopefully you will not encounter the issues i had to go through! i will come back and give them another shot with prices like this and quality this good  it's worth a 2nd shot 
this establishment has quickly becomes one of the busiest restaurants in downtown flushing  that says a lot  the soup dumplings is one of the very best around  the menu carries a lot different varieties as well  it is too bad the wait is a bit long for me that affect the dining experience a bit  they do offer give a complimentary order of  pork soup dumplings if your bill goes over $10 which means pretty much free for each visit 
my fave fave favvvvve soup dumpling in all of nyc  this place gets packed during dinner hours  but trust me when i say this place is worth the wait  you get to watch your beautiful soup dumplings made as you wait!
i wanted to try something new and was in the mood for soup dumplings but didn't want to go to joe's shanghai or nan xiang long bao so we ended up here  it's actually a really really nice restaurant and the atmosphere is pretty authentic and accurate in terms of chinese culture  it seems more like a hot spot for elder chinese folks so you might end up seeing a lot of family styled dinners  if you check in you also get a free order of soup pork dumplings  we also got the pork stir fried noodles and the beef scallion pancakes  this place definitely beats the other two more well known restaurants  menu is relatively cheap and only paid a little less than 12 bucks for 3 items  would definitely recommend to others and will be back!
often crowded but waiting time wasn't too long  food wasn't too bad but the prices weren't really worth it and from the two times i went there to eat with friends  the time it took for the food to come out was long  it is definitely a plus that the cashier lady was nice enough to let me charge my phone while we were waiting  so i would rate customer service 9 10  pros  pretty good food  customer service cons  slightly high prices  long time for food to come out
the wait is forever to get a table   free xiao long bao with check in and a purchase over $10   the portion are for single servings aka small   so please order two if you are hungrrrry   just for yourself   i wouldn't even share if you are hungry   double up on everything because by the time you sit down   you will be starving   i unfortunately got seated near the door and every person was crowding around my table which made my dining experience sucked    the food wasn't bad and prices were reasonable     a great substitute from nanjang xiao lao bao on prince st 
the xiaolongbao is the most authentic i've had in a while  better than those at cafe china  which even has a michelin star! the food comes in big portions and is surprisingly cheap  everything tasted really fresh  it's definitely a long subway ride from manhattan but it was worth it  i would not get the spicy wonton again  but the pork dumplings and xiaolongbao definitely made up for it 
worth restaurant  you better know the boss or manager to get fast server  otherwise  wait for their old customers and friends finished eating  and that will be your chance to seat 
not really sure what all the hype is around this spot   my wife saw this new shanghainese restaurant pop up on yelp with 4 5 stars while driving in through the area to pick up some groceries so we decided to make a stop here when we arrived  we saw a number of people inside waiting to be seated so that seemed like a plus  right?  patrons dining plus tons more waiting = good food?  the wait was about 20 mins but in reality it was 30 mins   as we were seated  we just wanted to sample just a few dishes so we opted for their soup dumplings  fried tiny buns (my favorite shanghainese dish) and rice cakes with minced pork and preserved veggies   food came out rather quick but the food tasted bland all around   thinking it may have been me and my faulty taste buds since i am recovering from an illness  i had to ask my wife and she said the same thing   the soup dumplings came in an order of 6 but the flavor was lacking and odd in some of them   the fried tiny buns were a disappointment as they were too big like eating those mantou buns   they also needed to be a bit crispier on the bottom   the rice cakes tasted like cardboard   all in all  not a spot i'd ever venture back here   for better soup dumplings in flushing  go hit up kung fu on main st 
had dinner here last saturday   we had really good classic shanghai dim sum  smoked fish  xiaolongbao  pan fried buns  and a couple of vegetable dishes   the food was all really tasty  and prices are reasonable   sole complaints are the long lines  cash only  and do not order their signature jumbo xiaolongbao (is filled only with soup  is a gimmick  stick to the traditional small xlb instead)   would happily come back 
love this place!!! only wished that parking around that area was a little more reasonable  we tend to avoid flushing like the plague now  since the parking is so atrocious! other than that  we love love love this place!
i have found it; my new favorite cheap chinese restaurant  so cheap that it's crazy  if you order $10 worth of food you get one free 6 steamed pork buns (whutt)  my friend and i got pan fried pork buns and crispy noodles with shredded pork (and of course the free steamed pork buns)  so 3 dishes in total  let me start off with the steamed pork buns  they're pretty good; it tastes just as good as nan xiang! the crispy noodles were really good; the noodles were really crispy  crunchy  and the sauce was tasty too  okay now let me rave about the pan fried pork buns   a mazin  the bottom of the buns were soooooo crispy that it was crazy  the inside was hot and steaming  very juicy pork inside just oozing with delectable meat juice  every bite was a party in my mouth  we spent $18 (plus tip and tax) in total   how freakin cheap is that?! love this place!
authentic dim sum place  shanghainese dishes for sure 
loved it   tried six different dumplings   place is spotless and service was friendly   my dad enjoyed the whole experience   would definitely go back   my favorite dish was wontons in spicy peanut sauce 
best soup dumplings!!! also appreciated the complimentary order with 10$ purchase  long lineups the saturday we were there  waited 40min for a table  loved the distinct shanghai flavor in the spicy noodle soup and braised hoof 
cannot complain   food was awesome  service was terrific and decor is good   bathrooms are a little gross but overall a very good experience   we had the soup dumpling  the pork dumpling  and shrimp and the beef   everything exceeded our expectations   i hope to go back 
we waited 15 minutes to get seated for lunch  the place is new so nice and clean  we ordered the gluten and the beef tendon cold dishes  portions were on the small side especially the beef tendon but it tasted fine  the salty soybean soup was meh  not much taste   both versions of the soupy dumplings were just ok  the steamed vegetable dumpling was not good  the beef in scallion pancake and the sautéed chinese squash were good but i don't think i'll be back  there are better places for this type of food in flushing  nan bei he (now closed) had the best salty soybean and steamed vegetable dumplings  the best soupy dumplings are in new world mall food court 
this might just be my new go to  came here last week to try out the soup dumplings as well as scallion pancakes and they were both delish!the only negative is that the dumpling skins are prone to tearing against the parchment paper in the steamer  maybe lettuce might be a better option? and i'm a little disappointed i didn't get that complimentary order of buns especially since i ordered like $20 worth of food but c'est la vie 
the prices were reasonable  food was good  we tried two different styles of chinese rice cakes  both were good  the xiao long bao  salt veg noodle soup  fried dumplings  and fried pork buns were all quite decent  they give a free order of xiao long bao with order over $10  there is also free sweet fermented rice wine soup with the meal  this is a plus  the only negative is half their staff are not friendly at all  the other half are nice  the place is busy  if they can get the staff to be nice  i think they "can keep" and "attract" more customers  everything is about service  service  service  make people feel welcome !!! people go there to spend money we would go back again if we ever go to flushing again 
love the fact that they gave us free soup dumplings and dessert! soup dumplings are good  very soupy  if you like nan xiang soup dumplings in flushing  i would say this one definitely beats it  i'm not a big fan of nan xiang  noodles are okay 
food is ok  but service is not  we did not eat the steamed buns   the waiter asid we ate them but is ok  if you out of it  you can just say so  we are ok with  but you can not said we ate it very angry          will not come again!
great find! a new restaurant only opened few weeks ago and already packed with customers! a samples a few dishes  soup dumplings  pan fried baos  chinese okra  fried fish with seaweed wrapper  some noodles and scallion pancakes with beef  everything was delicious  not one thing was disappointed! service was excellent and place is nice and well deco  we will definitely be back soon!
i got to this restaurant at around 6 30 on a saturday night and our party of 4 waited around an hour until we were seated  make sure to check in with a server when you get there and get a number from them  the staff seemed only fluent in mandarin and when customers tried to speak in english or cantonese the staff ignored them  in the end  we found a waiter who was willing to take our order as we pointed to the pictures on the menu  (i'm guessing the reason why their menu is in chinese  english  korean  and spanish is so that customers would be able to communicate with the waiters without words ) the interior is much nicer than the exterior  we ordered a steamed crab meat pork bun and a complimentary steamed pork bun  a shanghai special chicken  a deep fried yellow croaker with dried seaweed  a shanghai pan fried udon noodle  a turnip puff  and the large steamed soup bun  the servings were rather small  but for the price  i think it was worth it  everything was rather good  for some reason  i thought that the large steamed soup bun would be similar to the large shanghai bun served in manhattan  but it doesn't have any meat inside and is just soup wrapped in dumpling skin 
just open   the soup dumplings are really good   love the decor too   will definitely come again 
i was there for lunch  had their drunken chicken  shanghai thick noodle  steam pork bun and pan fried pork bun  i liked everything  will definitely return 
we are here expecting a 4 star experience   the staff rushes people through   the food is just okay   we've lived in asia and have eaten a lot of shanghai food   the large soup dumpling was bland  the pork bun was dense and bland  the duck was cold and bland   the pork soup dumplings were okay but many places in queens are better   even the ginger was bland   we won't be back 
i came to this restaurant with one of my colleagues from school and we were both satisfied   this is a very nice place    i like their food   i'll go back again 
the soup dumplings is probably best in flushing  paper thin dough oozing with lush broth waiting to hit your tongue  the eight treasure noodle soup is simply amazing   it has eight different ingredients pork  bamboo  peanuts  pea and four ingredients and mild spicy tang to it  totally slurp worthy   the braised pork leg or feet is absolutely succulent  perfectly fat to meat ratio  the fat melts in your mouth like a phenomenal piece of toro   definitely worth making a trip from the manhattan and go for authentic shanghainese food   service was good  very attentive  will be back very soon 
i've been here a lot of times and besides seating be a little tight (though not as tight as another older shanghainese spot in flushing)  i cannot complain about here and this is now my go to spot for really good shanghainese eats  i love their noodles and their wontons and their soup dumplings also are better than the other spot i mentioned before  way better  plus for now the soup dumplings are free for a check over 10 bucks  and please do try the pig knuckle  you will not regret it especially it's only 9 bucks and very delicious  another item i like here are the glutinous rice shumais  hopefully they can keep up the quality of the food for a very long time 
nice new soup dumpling place that is clean  came here with 3 other friends and ordered 2 soup dumplings  one of them was free as there was a special going on  a chicken soup  chicken rice cake  and pan fried noodles with seafood  word of advice  order only 1 noodle dish  it was a bit overbearing with the amount of carbs   but that may be a personal opinion  the soup dumplings were very good! i always enjoy that the skin is thin  and the soup was flavorful   not my favorite soup dumpling place in flushing but still very good   i didn't like how this place didn't have that many choices for cold sides  you will not find them here 
parking was a big pain   the restaurant would only sear us when the entire party was there   once we actually got seated  the whole experience was great   the waitress was very helpful and gave us the free order of soup dumplings   the food was cooked really well   my fil said that it was the best shanghainese food he's eaten in the states 
loved it here! the service was great! someone took our dumpling order right away and gave us some time before ordering other items  waiters were on point with checking if we needed refills or anything taken away  one of my favorite dishes is fried gluten 烤麩 and this place nails it  it's the perfect texture and taste  compared to other places in flushing that make it too salty  oily  or soft  their rice cake was amazing as well  i know this place is new so i hope they stay this amazing!
this is my favorite new restaurant in flushing  as people may not know  but the owners of corner 28 opened shanghai you garden   another thing you may not know  the head chef who used to work at nan xiang is now at you garden   once you walk into the restaurant you'll be pleasantly surprise with the nice decor   we got seated at the half booth and started looking at the menu  there are so many things we wanted to eat  but there were only two of us   they got the promotion if you order $10  you'll get one free steamed pork bun   we also order the pan fried pork buns  spicy noodles with beef   everything was delicious!  if you want to eat steamed pork buns steamed pork crab buns  you garden is the place to go   absolutely the best place to go other than traveling to taiwan   highly recommended!  so much better than nan xiang restaurant in flushing 
stumbled upon this place last week with my sister and dad  who came to flushing to try dim sum  needless to say  my dad really enjoyed it when he's sketchy on trying new foods  we ordered maybe 6 different ones (went more than a month ago  so don't really remember what lol) but we did order the soup dumplings  which always seem to be a must when we have dim sum  definitely coming back for more  )
unfortunately nanxiang was closed today due to the lunar new year  so my friend and i decided to check this place out instead  we ordered two servings of crab meat and pork soup dumplings  and an order of rice cakes with beef  as we were waiting for order  we looked over to another table near us and noticed that they had a side of a green vegetable that looked appealing  so my friend asked one of the waitresses what the dish was called  the waitress responded by giving us a look of pure disgust  she called over someone else who explained to us that it was pea shoots  and we went ahead and placed an order for that as well  when the soup dumplings arrived  the first thing we noticed was that they were all pork  with no crab meat as we had ordered (though they still charged us for the ones with crab)  although they were not nearly as good as the ones at nanxiang  they were decent  same with the rice cakes  though they were especially greasy  and the beef tasted like it was very cheap meat  then they brought us the bill   we noticed that our order of vegetables was $17 so naturally we thought that this was a mistake  we called the waiter over and he verified that in fact the price was correct  as we were ordering our soup dumplings the waiter kept saying something about giving us a free order of dumplings which we did not really understand  but now it was clear that in order to compensate for that  they were overcharging us for this  they even tried to cover up the price with other text on the bill  to put it into perspective  a green vegetable was basically 50% of our check  they were obviously trying to take advantage of us  on the way out the entire walkway of the restaurant smelled like human feces  like someone actually took a human shit in the restaurant  all in all  this meal came out to $40 for which we received mistreatment and fucked up smells 
the service is not so good  the quality of the food is below average 
i really don't get what the hype is about   i mean  the xiao long bao is good  but not worth waiting an hour and a half for   the flavor is not extra special or outstanding  it really is just alright 
can't say enough about chef zhu and his team  chef zhu has encyclopedic knowledge of shanghainese cuisine and it shows in the food that comes out of his kitchen  take a trip to shanghai just steps from the 7 train 
great place for delicious food! the service was great and they are knowledgeable about food allergies and is attentive to your needs   best soup dumplings around   i would recommend this place over joe shanghai for food and service!
one of the better xlb places in flushing  i actually would rate it after kung fu and nan xiang as the top three in the city  the quality is pretty consistent unlike joe's shanghai  the noodles and sides are pretty good too and portions are decent  highly recommended if you're craving xlb that doesn't have a overly sweet filling and broth (go to a taste of shanghai for that) 
first let me provide you with your warning   guarantee    this restaurant serves authentic shanghainese  cuisine  it is prepared to perfection and it is delicious but it is authentic  if you want to see how shanghainese people eat and experience that cuisine then you must come here  if you want chow mein with crispy noodles you must stay as far away as possible my friend and i started with the pickled shredded jelly fish  then chicken soup  then braised pork in a black sauce  then eel in another black sauce   all delicious! and!you get an order of soup dumplings on the house !!  if more exotic choices are not for you  do not worry  there are many mainstream dishes ( eg  general tso chicken) on the menu 
waiting line for a table was annoyingly long even on a regular wednesday afternoon so i put in two orders of crab pork soup dumplings to go  wait was at least fifteen minutes and although the staff were friendly enough  i had to keep my feet off the floor cause i  along with a senior couple and even one of the cooks behind the bar saw a big roach crawl by  that was pretty gross but the soup dumplings were on point 
the soup dumplings are alright here  the skin is a bit thick for my taste  on the bright side though  they give you a free order of pork soup dumplings! my mom and i ordered pork soup dumplings  pan fried dumplings  noodle soup with preserved cabbage and pork  and wine chicken  the food overall is decent but i definitely wouldn't wait awhile to try the food  if you're coming on a weekend  you'll most likely have to wait a bit for a table  what i do like about this place though is that the decor is clean and simple  if you can make it out to flushing on a week day  i'd recommend it  otherwise be prepared to wait for a table 
just as good (if not better) than nan xiang dumpling housei'm so happy to have found a new soup dumpling place in flushing! first  if you order more than $10 worth of food  you get a **complimentary** order of their soup dumplings which is a great deal  moreover  the soup dumplings are awesome    they are a nice size and the broth is really hot  we also got the cold cucumbers with garlic (pretty good) and an order of crispy noodles with pork and a sauce (it was ok)  shanghai you garden must really be giving nan xiang dumpling house a run for their money    the food is at least as good  and the service and ambience are much better  they open at 8 a m  and have a breakfast menu  which is also a huge plus since some of my favorite sit down breakfast places in flushing have shut down  so this place helps fill that void 
i'm from shanghai originally  and hope this adds some credibility to my following comments  authentic shanghai food doesn't cost much to make  we can use some flour and rice  a little bit pork to make food  here you have "you tiao"  "ci fan gao"  "jiu niang yuan zi"  "shao mai"  and of course  the soup dumplings  these are all involved with cheap ingredients  (yes  we were very poor and had to be cost effective)  but good chef will use his magic to turn it to super delicious beautiful food to satisfy shanghai locals picky taste  based on my two visits  i can be fairly confident to say  this is the best shanghai restaurant i've ever found   lowest price  and fabulous dim sum  i haven't tried any other dishes  but the food presented looked beautiful  i'll try their lion head next time when i visit  it's a traditional shanghai dish and i will be able to tell if that's authentic  see you soon!
the disposable chopsticks bleed color  if you wipe them on the napkin  you will see brown stains =   the food is good  but not any better than other restaurants that offer shanghainese cuisine 
i just heard about this place having good soup dumplings and wanted to try it out  i came with my friend for dinner at about 7 30pm on a weekday and i was worried there would be a long wait but we literally just had to wait 30 seconds  we ordered one pork soup dumplings  one pork and crab soup dumplings  fried spare ribs in wuxi style  a chicken soup  and beef scallion pancake  everything was delicious! the soup dumplings are good and i've been to many soup dumpling places  the crab and pork ones are more complex and you can definitely taste the crab in these unlike some other places  also  the black vinegar on the table was really good  it might be odd to compliment a condiment but we found it to be clean and complex  perfect dipping sauce with the shredded ginger  we saw the ribs from another table that looked good and asked what they were (after quietly debating if we should be kind of rude and ask)  we're glad we did! they were delicious and they go well with the bit of bok choy underneath  the chicken soup was standard for a chinese restaurant we just wanted a soup to share  the beef scallion pancake was good as well  perfectly crispy  not too oily  and the hoisin sauce in it was delicious maybe just have a little more inside the decor is nice and the service was good  we're definitely coming back to try other foods  it seems like they do all the shanghai foods well  the pork soup dumplings were no charge because of their over $10 deal 
when i came there was a 10 minute wait and the restaurant was extremely crowded  i had high hopes considering all the great reviews on yelp  before we were seated the manager(?) was quite rude and rushed me and my friend to our table  we ordered the rice cakes with shredded chicken  pan fried dumplings  shanghai shui mai  and we were given complimentary pork soup dumplings  which was nice a nice touch  most of the food we ate was bland  the only things we truly enjoyed were the pan fried dumplings and the soup dumplings  maybe we didn't order the right things but everything else was definitely lacking flavor  bottom line  we didnt enjoy the bland food  the rushed manager  and one of the rude waiters we encountered 
we ordered spicy beef & tripe  steamed pork bun  steamed crab meant pork buns and a warm sweet soy bean milk  the steamed crab pork bun was better than any place around the area  their beef and tripe was very tender  you can get complimentary steamed pork bun when you order more than $10 since it's their grand opening  they also surprised us with a complimentary dessert  the service here is pretty decent  what i like the most other than their soup dumpling is the decorations 
soup dumplings are to die for! my two rating is for the service  not a fan of the waiters   i always feel rushed 
this place is so much better than the currently better known but like 3x times more expensive "joe shanghai" which is overhyped  shanghai you garden offers amazing prices for amazing food! the prices lets you order so much different kinds of foods to try at an unbeatable price  it really serves up well if you like to try the whole menu and not break the bank eating delicious chinese shanghainese food  to start  their soy milk is soooo delicious  so smooth and tasty  had to order 3 for myself during the course of my meal with my family and friends  their noodles are tasty  especially their fried noodles with the options of beef and chicken and seafood  they have a dish that ive never seen or tasted before which tasted amazing! kung po eel which was a most definitely delicious and different and unique dish  definitely worth trying and you can "do it for the gram" or "do it for the snap" and show off your adventurous dish  their soup dumplings are soupy and tasty  which has more flavor than joe shanghai  you have your choice of pork  and crab  they come steamy hot and fresh as they are made fresh every single time  you can see the ladies wrapping them up when you first walk into the restaurant in the kitchen behind the glass  creating each delicious soup dumpling one at a time  they have this pretty good "drunken chicken"  quality chicken meat  you also have a choice of some beef   and other pork dishes  definitely have to go and try out the menu yourself  which wont actually break your wallet and bank as you do so ;) lol which is always a great quality of a restaurant that also offers a tremendous taste for your mouth and belly xp
forget joe's  *this* is the place for soup dumplings  so delicious and flavorful  non graesy  lots of excellent items on the menu  and service was great  seating wasn't cramped or small  just so much better than any soup dumpling place i've been to in a long time  both in flushing and in manhattan  highly recommended (though prepare for a bit of a wait) 
the environment is good and food are very delicious i often come here but this morning there was a waitress that engage me in a stomach gas  first she bowed her face to speak very red just like who owes her money  i bring a child but she will not ask you if you need baby chair or plastic tray fork like other waiter  it does not matter there is not enough tissue to use and we need to ask her for it the important thing is there are two guests who are next to my table they have two bowls of bean curd a fried fritters and did not leave a tip for her  she said to the other waiter "they did not leave a tip you can not ask for?"and then said if can not afford to eat please don't come while she was cleaning the table  and lot of guests have heard this word when i checked and i wanted package  she asked me which to pack   i ordered total four things and every thing eat only half   i said all packed and she went with the cashier to talk with their language which i could not understand but i can imagine what she said like before she said to the two guests after i checked i didn't leave tips for her she came to say that the beauty of the bill does not include tips! i said i knew i was not the first time to eat  your attitude is so bad! i want to leave  she spoke in the back that did not see such a person! even my child say that the aunt is not good !the tip is based on waiter's service that is good or bad   i never given no tip but today this person is too bad to eat and eat a stomach gas 
this place is bustling! we got take out here after a day at spa castle  good food at reasonable prices  not everyone speaks great english but the staff is friendly and attentive  tables are close together  i might prefer nan xiang xiao long bao for dining in  we got assorted dumplings  spicy beef tendon and black fungus  those leftover mushrooms made an awesome omelet the next morning!
this restaurant is as legit as it gets! as someone who ate shanghainese food growing up  i'm extremely particular about how authentic "shanghainese" food is in ny  this place totally fits the bill  this restaurant has been featured in numerous magazines and tv shows and has become somewhat of a must for asians in the vicinity  i recommend the deep fried yellow croaker with dried seaweed  the outside fried layer is fried to a crisp  but not to the point of becoming excessively oily  and the inside fish just falls into your mouth  it's the best fried fish i've had in the states  the restaurant also gives you a complimentary set of soup dumplings once you hit a minimum (i forgot the minimum  but the soup dumplings were delicious tasted similar to din tai fung's)  they also serve the large soup dumplings where you use a straw to sip the soup  but i've never been a fan so i'll leave others to be the judge of their large soup dumplings  will definitely be coming back     often 
the soup dumplings were surprisingly good  heard from the grape vine that a chef from nanxiang had been hired here  however  wasn't a big fan of the scallion pancakes  not my first choice but a decent backup 
the service was terrible  they sat us down at a table near the doors  away from the rest of the restaurant and completely forgot about us  we flagged them down multiple times and they still never came over  it wasn't until we stood up and walked over to them that they even remembered to give us menus!! the table was very dirty  there were pieces of food all over the chairs    we asked them for a cloth to wipe it down ourselves and they refused! after a lot of asking  one of the employees used their hands to slap the chairs all while very annoyed  the food is average at best  i highly doubt i will recommend this place to any of my friends 
honestly  these are the best soup dumplings that i have ever had in the world  better than din tai fung in asia and better than joe shanghai's in nyc  the dumplings are huge and the skin is nice and thick so it doesn't break easily  customer service is friendly and the food is excellent  check in on yelp for a free order on soup dumplings ($5 95 value)! i will definitely be back for more  just be prepared for at least 30 minute wait on weekends 
new  clean  lots of space   and soup dumplings  i thought all the food was great  the staff was really nice  and would be happy to go again and again  i definitely think this place is special and would be deserving to get all the press and blog mentions et cetera  i was surprised that it is owned by corner 28  but maybe this is their version of going upscale  hey  if this is that  then i am totally down for it 
definitely gives nan xiang a run for its money  a lot of the dishes are similar and are prepared very similarly  with a nearly identical menu to nan xiang  the soup dumplings are comparable in texture but have slightly different flavors  the crab soup dumplings here taste crabbier  definitely get the salty green mochi they have up front  it's amazing! this is definitely a place to go for standard shanghainese fare (rice cakes  crispy noodles  cold dishes)  and the customer service here is quite good too 
is "total" a really hard english word to understand? clearly  some waiters do not understand it we ordered in chinese and still got the order wrong  we told the waiter instantly when we know the order was wrong and they were like "o well  deal with it" kinda attitude  if you don't mind that  then it's okay 
the worst place for dining   the employees were in the lala land   forgot what we ordered juicy buns exactly what the place sales and named after   the waiters blamed on each other   however  they brought 2 sauces for the juicy buns right after we placed the order    not so smart 
the xiao lung bao's here are excellent especially with their free offer 1 order xiao lung bao's when you spend $10   i order the spicy beef noodle soup  the flavor is good  but  they needed to tenderize the beef more   another advantage they have over nan xian xiao long bao is they have  more food selection on their menu 
dad really wanted to come here because he kept seeing the advertisement on the chinese channel  we waited for about 30 minutes before we were seated  though it was fully staffed  there were times when you couldn't find a waiter in sight  the food was okay  nothing to wow about  they were out of pig ear and spicy chicken feet and we were told that sometimes they just don't make 'em  the jellyfish was more turnip than jellyfish and the pan fried noodles was typical  the rice cake with pork and veggies was pretty good though  all in all  it's alright  not spectacular but not bad either 
service bad bad bad and rush you to leave although no one waiting outside  waiter came near the table every 5 mins and wanted to clear yr dishes fast although it's not finished  same happened to some friends who ate there  terrible 
not my type! i was born on shang hai  butthis xiao long bao is not taste well as real shang hai xiao long bao  the meat is not fresh enough  but ok  i am not recommend this place as first come visitor 
simple delicious soupy dumplings ever  i am a total soupy dumplings fan and this place is it   really tasty dishes ( i love the xiao lun bao   soupy dumplings ) the most   lol   but beef noodle soup was great too   and among appetizers like drunken chicken  prices are great  seating are comfortable   try them out  )
best soup dumplings in the city  i think they are also still having a free order of soup dumplings (xiao long bao) special with your meal because they just opened! either way  this place is a legit chinese restaurant in flushing (aka the closest to china you'll get in the us)  where you know the food is the real deal because most of the clientele is asian! of note  there are also english speakers and importantly  clear  good quality pictures on the menu to help those of us who don't speak chinese get our authentic and delicious chinese meal fix on! (or those of us that are half asian like me and should speak more chinese but don't)  check this place out   trust me  you won't regret it 
this restaurant deserves a five star review on its food  way better soup dumplings compared to nanxiang dumpling house  the soup was rich and tasty  and the dough was the right amount of thickness and chewiness  and you got one order for free for their grand opening  the only thing i was not so impressed was their service  they were attending but the order could work out better  we finished our meal with the appetizer the fried dough aka youtiao at last  i'm very happy to see more and more authentic mandarin chinese restaurants popping up in flushing and would really like to see their efforts not only on bringing good food but also good services to all customers 
really enjoyed eating here  efficient line where you get a ticket and you can go around flushing while waiting for a table to clear  also  you get free soup dumplings with orders over $10  which is the best thing ever and those things are as tasty as they get  they also give you this free sweet gelatinous rice ball soup thing  which is also great because it's free and pretty good! in nyc  it's so rare to get things for free  we also ordered the tofu egg shrimp dish  which is incredibly rich but good  their turnip pastries also had ham (i think) inside in addition to turnip  which was a nice surprise and not usually part of the recipe  however  i enjoyed it  the only thing i regretted ordering is the large soup dumpling for $2 99  for some reason  they gave me the crab one and inside it was only broth  no crab meat  just oily  crab flavored broth inside the skin of the dumpling  i understand why they gave me a straw to drink from  but literally there was no meat which is expected of a bao fast  attentive service 
love the free soup bun after $10 of purchase during dinner time  food is amazing and price is great  service in the other hand is soso but nice area and i will go again 
very disappointed compare to the first time we went! we order 6 dishes in total  4 came very quick  2 were not  30 mins later  we asked where the food are  the lady went to check  came back saying they had the order down  ok! 5 mins later  one dish came and we still missing one  which was only a simple vegetable rice  so we waited! took another 10 mins before it came to the table  there were a lot of people working there  but it just a totally fail on getting the order to the table  not to mention we had asked a few times 
very authentic! love the soup dumpling there and other dishes 
been here a few times  food has improved  great svc and comfy seating  dont order the big bun  its just thick skin with broth inside  
always come back here for food  soooooo nice  traditional taste even hard to find in shanghai nowadays  bring me back to childhood memory 
great shanghainese cuisine  the place can be a little hard to find  for those not familiar with flushing  but really worth the trip  the seating is really spacious  lots of room at the table for all the great little snacks  will be back soon 
this is so far the best steam soup buns place in nyc   the flavor is very authentic  for most dishes  and not pricy at all   they also serve food fast  and have for sure above average service as a chinese restaurant 
my new spot for soup dumplings and anything shanghainese  way to step up to the plate you garden  awesome decor and service as well    let's see how long before you have to wait for a table 
this place serves delicious soup dumplings of both the pork and crab variety  the pan fried dumplings and buns were a bit too toasty on the bottom and left much to be desired  the staff were attentive and this coupled with the attractive well lit decor with clean and comfy seating areas means i'm looking forward to coming back for another round of soup dumplings 
great service and clean environment  it's my second time there and i'm definitely impressed by the customer service and the cleaniness 
bad service  made reservation and arrived on time  but still waited in line for 40 more minutes  not sure how the reservation works  the manager kept saying "another 5 minutes " if you want to get something to eat on time  skip this place 
probably one of the worst shanghainese restaurants that i have ever been to   if you are shanghainese and foodie  you definitely will not be impressed by the food quality   we ordered jelly fish appetizer and it was so salty   the kau fu wasn't nicely made  so oily   fish head casserole was horrible   the soup doesn't taste like shanghainese style at all and the fish head wasn't even cooked and we had to send it back   sautéed eel was another disaster   will never go back to the restaurant again 
2 5 stars for the food and 0 5 extra star for the ambience the food is mediocre at best  we ordered the bean cud where the tofu was way too firm  the eel was obviously frozen and not fresh  the fried dough was a bit stale and the skin of the steamed dumpling was way too thick i have been on the hunt for a good shengjian bun place throughout 5 boroughs for the last couple years  after the waitress told me there was a 15 25 minutes wait for the shengjian bun i really had my hope up  what a let down! it came out closer to pan fried beef buns (google the word "牛肉煎包" if you want to know what it is) than shengjian bun  the bottom was not crispy and the top was way to mushy  consider that both a taste of shanghai and nanxiang dumpling house are no more than 2 blocks away  i am not in a hurry to come back here any time soon 
this place was awesome! amazing dumplings for a great price! it was clean  beautiful  and surprisingly not packed so it's a perfect atmosphere! i would go back for the soup dumplings  chive pancake  and the seafood dumplings are a must!  ) even the tea they serve is great and it's right next to the 7 subway stop 
i was really surprised by this place  it was located on one of the dingier streets in flushing and i have passed by it many times  when you go in  it has actually really nice ambiance with good decor  the food was also very good and the free order of soup dumplings makes it an amazing value  i personally loved the sweet tofu soup as their tofu is very silky  the soup dumplings have good skin  lots of soup and tastes of what the filling should be  the service was also very fast  i would definitely come back and will be bringing others with me next time 
came on a weekend afternoon for lunch  very crowded  we asked about the waiting time  and they told us it should not be very long  however  we waited more than 30 minutes!! the thing is that we only have two people and they give priority to group 3 or 4  and we saw a lot of people coming later than us get seated before us  then finally it's our turn  but it turns out we need to share the four seats table with another couple! if you are going to set up like this  you need to ask and confirm with the customers first! we did not eat  so no comment on the food  but's in flushing  a place full of authentic chinese food!
new restaurant in downtown flushing   soup dumplings are fresh and delicious   try the braised bean curd   it is excellent   staff is very friendly and attentive   most speak excellent english and welcome all patrons   very clean    including bathrooms   a must for newbies to soup dumplings  crab is real crab 
i arrived here at 12 30pm on a saturday  we were a group of two and we were seated within 15 minutes   there is still an unadvertised special  we ordered a basket of crabmeat pork soup dumplings for $7 and we got a free order of pork soup dumplings! we got this last time when we stopped in at 10am   i think this time was so much better  i think that we got frozen leftovers last time and  this time  the soup dumplings were fresh! we also ordered the steamed veggie dumplings   don't get that  it was such a disappointment after the soup dumplings  these were so dry that we ended up dunking them into our noodle soup  we had ordered the vegetable noodle soup  my mom isn't into spicy food and the choices of noodle soup were mostly spicy ones  if you like shitake mushrooms  this soup is heavily flavored with these shrooms  word of warning  their soups are cheap and very large! we left the restaurant very stuffed    and for less than $20 (before tip)  highly recommended if you are a lover of soup dumplings 
what i can say bad about this? nothing  good service  well ran by a great owner  food is delicious and seating is comfortable  its definitely the new gem of flushing restaurants  soup dumplings were juicy and moist and flavorful  much better than the not so good and hyped joe shanghai  you can try the pork and crab soup dumplings at a fraction of the joe shanghai prices  their menu is simple but holds some delicious things you can try  from their fried noodles  to their pork shank  fried fish  jellyfish  soups and delicious soy milk that they make themselves and just so many other choices i am forgetting off the top of my head that ive tried  get here early because this place can get busy due to that fact that the food here is very good and worth waiting for  you won't be disappointed in the food and the price  you leave this place feeling 1000% satisfied  your stomach and your wallet  lol  this is a huge "definite" try 
the place was jam packed on a sunday around lunch but we got a table for two in about 10 minutes so the wait wasn't bad at all   we ordered 3 items   soup dumplings  shrimp and veggie pan fried noodles   the veggie pan fried noodles were not a menu item but all other shnaghinese places make it whether it is on the menu or not   i was told by the waitress that they don't make it   it has to come with meat or seafood   i asked why they can't make it without meat or seafood and i was told that it would not taste good without meat   i explained that other competitors make it and i don't eat meat or seafood   she then asked if i wanted just the pan fried noodles with soy sauce   i had to reiterate that i wanted veggies   she then looked annoyed and said she will have them make the pork pan fried noodles minus the pork   it came out ok   nothing spectacular but not bad either   the soup dumplings which i thought were an appetizer  came out last and only after following up with them   the taste of the food wasn't bad but the service could use some improvement 
unlike the street bbq  this restaurant's bbq tastes much better than those in the street  especially their texture  i can taste that their meat is much fresher than others i love the raw beef bbq the most  i used to eat a lot in china  but ever since i come to the us  couldn't find any place to eat this  make me miss my hometown sometimes service is a little bit slow because the store is not that big  but service quality is pretty good  waiter and waitress are very friendly  i definitely will come here very often  recommend to you as well 
love their meat pie(火勺）and lamb soup ( other foods are about average)  poor hygiene and bad services are their biggest spotlight  yes  they don't care about their consumers  don't ever expect to receive an average service here cuz they don't have any here  they ignore you since the moment you step in the restaurant  sometimes  you'd have to service yourself cuz they won't serve you any drink unless you ask 
try the beef 火勺 (bun?) and the lamb tripe soup  zouji bbq (邹记牛肉火勺) is located in the less crowded side of main street  away from the 7 train  the service here is nice  very polite! the menu is in chinese and be aware that there is no bbq available in the morning or early noon hours since the bbq cook comes in later  the kitchen is is open for other non bbq items on the menu and you might be able to request certain dishes off the menu  for instance  we ordered a couple of the small beef buns  lamb soup  a dozen dumplings but i also ached for something lighter so i asked if there are any veggie offerings  the lady who attended us was able to get the kitchen to fix up some cucumber salad off the menu these pastry buns (火勺) are small ($0 75 each) and not the fluffy kind  this type of savory pastry supposedly originated back in the 1100's  under emperor taizu of jin as army food  nowadays there are many variations depending on the region and often considered to be halal  around tieling region in northeast of china  according to wiki baidu  the locals serve these beef buns alongside the lamb soup  the lamb soup is a milky white broth with diced tripe  with a few sprinkle salt and a bit of adjustment to the game smell of lamb  you'll be enjoying this in no time while pairing it with the buns skip the dumplings  while generous in size  the wrapping dough is much too thick cash only  3 75 stars
the 火勺 is really good! taste exactly like the one i used to eat in my hometown tieling  very authetic i also like their bbq and cold dish a lot  especially the raw shrimp  spicy but taste so good  a very good choice to choose when you are planning to drink a beer sometimes they are busy and wait a little bit long  but the food worths the wait 
this is amazing restaurant  not very big  but very clean  excellent service!  i live in brooklyn  i used amost like 2hours to drive there  the food is very good  makes me feel like i am in my hometown i highly recommend it!
walking in i can see that this is a tiny mom and pop shop  i bought 5 lamb spicy cumin skewers for about 7 50! (will post pictures on my next visit)  holy smokes  this place is now my go to spot for lamb skewers protein fix  i usually don't like going to street carts to get the skewers due to the cleanliness and getting sick from the food  the lamb here is thicker and chunkier than the street carts  glad to have this in the neighborhood  their menu is entirely chinese  so you have to point at the pictures on the wall to tell them what you want! luckily i can speak wing out the mandarin 
nice place to gathering with friends and the food are great! you won't regret coming here to eat these delicious food!! i love their raw beef bbq  chicken bbq  and huo shao 
the place might be petite but it is packed with flavor  must order the soup and the pancake on the front page of the menu   bbq is awesome as advertised   however the noodle is just as good  will come back many more times 
my two favorite items on the menu are the grilled fish and the raw meat on skewer (it does taste like its tossed over the fire really quickly before it's served so it has a perfect medium rare texture)  i'm not too familiar with food from northern china  but the skewers here are way better than the street cart bbq skewers  it gives me a new respect for food northerner food  if you like flavorful  spicy food  this is the place for you! the signature item on the menu here is homemade beef pancakes so make sure you order this first as it does take some time to prepare and cook  i drool a bit just thinking about the crispy  flakey texture when you bite down and stopping at the juicy meat stuffed inside  great place for drinkers  the shop is small and cozy so get here before the line starts to form  the location is a little bit satellite but definitely worth the trip  if you're out late at night and looking for a place for round 2 or round 3  they're open until 2am!
there bbq is sooo good fresh and teasty the cold dish is fantastic too love this place!b
lucky restaurant fills a void in my heart that deeply craves taiwanese food  what could possibly be more satisfying than having stewed pork intestines and duck blood? so fine  i'll admit nostalgia plays an unmistakable role in my appreciation for this restaurant  still  i wouldn't settle for a weak imitation  so it must be worth something that lucky restaurant met my expectations  everything i've had here is good  which in itself deserves high praise  though there are a few dishes that stand out  the aforementioned spicy pork intestine and duck blood stew is not the best i've ever had  but it's still pretty fantastic  the whole fish in black bean sauce is amazing   if it's available  get it live and with tofu  and you can never go wrong with the braised pork over rice  also recommended is a house special creatively titled "pork & dried bean curd hakkanese style stir fry"  which features sa cha sauce (if you've never tried it  it's a uniquely flavored umami bomb)  the only thing that's kind of a bummer is the portion size  i do wish their dishes were sized a bit larger  it's not a problem to the degree that it's a dealbreaker  but if you're eating with a hungry party  i'd definitely recommend over ordering a little  the space is small and plainly decorated  i can't remember if they actually had a drop ceiling and florescent lights  but it's got that sort of vibe  people definitely come for the food  i recommend bringing cash  you can pay with a card if necessary  but bring cash   you'll thank me later  also  byob  there's a deli next door that can accommodate the basics 
i ate at lucky restaurant on a weekday afternoon  and i was mostly satisfied with the food and service  though there's room for improvement in both areas i opted for their lunch special   i ordered a shrimp and broccoli dish  which came with white rice and soup  the staff worker who took my order was sensitive to my food restrictions  and the person who brought my food to me was exceptionally warm  which i felt thankful for the shrimp and broccoli was succulent and went well with the sauce it came with  i felt that the chefs put too much broccoli and held back on giving me a good portion of shrimp  which felt disappointing  i also wish that i had a choice of what soup to order  since the spicy one i ate  i didn't like  another thing that prevented my experience from being a good one  was that a building inspector came and interacted with two staff workers at the restaurant  it felt odd to be dining there while the building inspector was around  granted  the restaurant staff maybe couldn't control when the inspector came in  but it would've been great for them to talk outside and away from their customers this isn't my first choice restaurant when it comes to taiwanese food  but i may give it a second try if i'm in the area again 
portion is good  price is ok did i mention that their tea taste like coco black tea? i meant it tasted good and refreshing  mapo tofu was ma and not too spicy but it has great flavor that drags me into digging in  three cup chicken and salt and pepper ribs were ok  and smoked pork was a good choice to have service was good and attempting i'm gonna give the cashier a +1 for her sense of humor and attitude  well done definitely will be back again to try the other dishes 
if you're in the mood for taiwanese food  this is the place to check out! quality food that comes out quick along with great service  they also accept credit cards!!  here's the breakdown  place   located in the other side of flushing  a small restaurant that pumps out delicious taiwanese dishes  make sure to call for reservations  not much decor but your typical tables you find at dine in chinese places does the job  parking can be a bit tough as well  service   hard workers  they are running around working non stop  during my dinner our waitress was attentive and helpful with recommending dishes  food   everything we ordered was great  we got the following scallion pancakes   just right and not oily eggplant app   a cold eggplant appetizer that has a meat sauce over it  good to eat on by itself or with some rice hot & sour soup   really good  it was like a mix of egg drop with hot and sour  not your typical from to go joints  minced pork over rice   classic and must order just cause!! salt and pepper pork chops   can't go wrong  the right amount of spices without being too salty and the chips were meaty  liver dish? don't know the name in english but it was good  see if you can spot it in my messy pic lol also the vegetable dish it has minced black beans  tofu  peppers  pork  garlic   far right in the pic  get it!! overall a great dinner  i'll be back !
probably one of the best taiwanese joints i've been to in flushing  the folks working at visiting flushing hospital just got an incredible new food option dropped in their laps  went there with a friend and his taiwanese spouse  we feasted on 3 entrees and 2 appetizers for a grand total of $53  byob a huge plus  we basically cleared all the plates  loved the stinky tofu and the kidney and shrimp (don't knock it till you try it)  definitely going back for more 
best taiwanese place in flushing in my opinion  friendly service and scrumptious food  byob definitely a huge plus 
ordered their shredded beef with peppers and kung pao chicken  both were good! i love that their food is not greasy and salty like most chinese food!
this chinese restaurant is fairly small but hard to fit a large group  i came here with 13 people and it just fit perfectly  temperature here is controlled and calm  food overall was really good and filling 
minced pork over rice is the must try! don't order anything has pig blood cake  it taste weird and feel not fresh 
i live just two blocks away from this restaurant but the food isn't something super spectacular that makes me want to eat at all the time  in the modern time and age not alot of people cook at home much anymore and are often eating out  i  myself happen to be very guilty of that  while they do have one or two dishes i really do enjoy  i don't always find myself ordering from this restaurant even though it is so convenient for me the restaurant itself is kind of small inside but service is very good  one of my favorite part is that they speak fluent english  the food however i feel like there is definitely room for improvement   nothing really stands out but it's not terrible either  the parking isn't too hard to find because around the corner there's a small section of meter parking on the block  besides that area i feel like parking can be limited because this is a residential area 
great food! great prices! great location  if you drive  there's a good amount of street parking  you can avoid main street flushing traffic  great take out menu  i recommend the fish with chili and cumin as well as the pork shank  the vegetables are also very sweet  they have lunch special too! enjoy  
small establishment  very cozy and welcoming  the mapo tofu was good  decent size for the price  good mala flavoring  nice amount of spiciness  love eating this with rice  slightly disappointed there were no other ingredients in the mapo tofu besides tofu (like ground meat  celery  etc)  but makes sense for the price flavors for three cup chicken were on point  but the abundance of bones ruined it for me  the dish was smaller than expected for $12 99  and it had a lot of bones so i didn't get much meat to eat  decent place if you're in the area 
i ordered ma po tofu today with my coworkers  it's sooo good  we love the tofu  it's very soft and tasty   it's not like si chuang style(mad spicy)  this is just perfect! we will defiantly visit again next time 
tried general tso's chicken and shredded beef with hot peppers here   tastes fresh and good portion size!  lunch special comes with soup!  feels clean compared to other chinese takeout food 
strongly recommend! good restaurant! although the restaurant is not spacious  i will come here very often  by the way  their fish is delicious 
checked out this newly opened chinese restaurant supposedly owned by the owner of one of the earliest chinese restaurants on main street flushing  lao dai ji  from at least 30 years ago  a mixture of typical taiwanese  shanghainese  and szechuan dishes on the menu  we tried their fava bean with scallions and chicken marinated in wine cold dishes  meat ball in brown sauce  seaweed fried fish  and stir fried rice cake with cabbage  the cold dishes were pretty authentic but the meat ball meat was too skinny 
imo many great tasting taiwanese restaurants in flushing have gone downhill in taste over the years due to change of chefs   thanks to my mechanic who's a frequent here since day1 and he introduced me to a new joint near flushing hospital called lucky restaurant 小炒王(king of stirr fry)   imo best traditional taiwanese dishes i've tasted in years    i'm so glad i found my new taiwanese food in flushing and my new favorite  the owner is hip and cool and well spoken   byob  i highly recommend!
this place is very legit and authentic  with a lively atmosphere  my family came here to eat  and we knew it would be good because of the lines of chinese families  my family had the taiwanese beef noodle soup  duck blood with chives  scallion pancake and the double cooked pork  the portions were pretty large for their side  and each entree comes with white rice (but you can always order more)  the scallion pancake was mediocre because the dough was too thick  but otherwise  everything was delicious  for those of you who can't eat spicy  be careful here because this region of china's food is typically spicy  so you'll need to confirm with the waiters about the spiciness levels i would definitely recommend anyone who wants legitimate jiangsu (shanghainese) chinese food to come here to eat!
probably the best beef noodle soup in queens  gona go back and try more food  will update   straight legit tho
im giving it a 3 star for service and food  went here for noodle soup thats  nothing extra ordinary   theres better places in flushing
one of my friend recommended this place cause the quality of the food was great and it was outside of main street flushing  i grab one of the take out menu just to see what variety and the pricing is like and at first i thought the price wasn't that bad and decided to order some take out  order two dishes and when i picked up to pay  the price of the dishes wasn't what it was advertise on their take out menu  so for a restaurant that just open a few months ago and still have the grand opening sign up  to change the price  it's  just fault advertisement  i would not go back to the place since the portion of what you get for the price that you are paying is not worth it  there are other places with similar taste but at a cheaper price
even better now with new owner  the food is incredible and really satisfies my taiwanese food cravings 
authentic taiwanese food  the minced port over rice is a must try! the service is great and price is reasonable  will be back!
the food looks alot better in photos then actually tasting it  the steak sizzle plate was very plain and unflavourful while the pork chops were bland  not much else to say except maybe try other dishes???
stumble upon this resturant and they had a soft opening  the food here is very reasonable priced and very good  for a small place they have delicious dishes 
i ordered take out from here about a month ago  i went around 5pm and they didnt have more than half of the cold dishes which was a disappointment when i got home  the food was very oily and the portions were not comparable to the price i got the zang wong ( pigs blood with intestines) the sauce was good but there were barely any pieces of intestine and that order was like $16 and do not get the dumplings from here  they were really nasty and expensive the skin was so thick with barely any filling and there were 8 pieces for $6!! never again if youre going to call yourself a tawianese joint u need to have some of the taiwanese snacks such as stinky tofu and oyster pancake  didnt have either  im more than likely not going to be coming back here again 
we came here twice  first time was for dinner  ordered a sizzling steak and chicken with garlic basil casserole  both are very good  second time  we ordered take out  beef noodle soup and pork with garlic sauce over rice   the beef noodle soup is the best around town! must eat here! the price of the dishes are very affordable 
love their taiwanese beef noodles!   always crowded and busy    will definitely try some of their dishes next time 
the food here is very average  i've tried much better tasting tsong wong (duck blood  ) elsewhere  the sauce had no flavor for one   it was our first time here and was hoping for some good suggestions on food  even though our waitress was pleasant the dou ban striped bass tasted horrible and had no flavor plus it was quite expensive for some frozen farmed fish  other than that  the service was nice  restroom was clean  front counter person nice  i will come back again with my cousin and order some of the classic dishes we had in taiwan and see what he says  
great food! owners were lovely  will definitely be back  the chicken and basil casserole was some of the best chicken i've ever had 
authentic   100%probably the best taiwanese beef noodles in queens  attentative staff!!
i went there for dinner 1 time   and the place looks nice but what disappointed me was that the chicken leg over rice was 8 in change from the menu in the restaurant which was tiny tiny bit expensive than competitors and the portion was much smaller compare to other taiwanese restaurants and the chicken doesn't have any taste and pan fried dumplings is 7 dollars with 8 dumplings only  i don't understand where they get the reasonable price from and the good taste and i have no interest to slander this restaurant but i was quite disappointed 
the restaurant is clean  about half the tables have a built in grill but for the other half  they will bring a table top grill to you  everything is a la carte  from the lettuce rice kimchi to the meat  so the price comes out to be very cheap depending on what your order  however  it does not come with any of the banchans that you typically get at other kbbq places  the meat was delicious and good quality  my boyfriend and i got the bulgogi & the pork belly and that was filling for the both of us  all the plates are $9 99 lb and i hope they do keep it that way  overall  the food was delicious and the meal was very inexpensive when compared to other places my only concern was the service  there was about 2 servers and we went for dinner around 7 30pm and the place was busy  it was a little hard to get their attention  they also forgot one of our orders (which turned out to be okay because we got too much food already) and then charged us for a second rice (but we never got the first bowl so i had to ask for it again)  however  they were understanding and had deducted it from our bill after i had brought it to their attention (so double check your bill to make sure!) overall  good atmosphere to eat  the food was good  the service could use some improvement but i would go back and give them another chance!
the $$$ rating is totally off   it's more along the lines of $$  mainly because of the everyday $10 per meat dish that's unheard of in queens ktown   the price is balanced off by not offering very much in the way of banchan  which are practically non existent   however  you can order some a la carte   you do get a bottomless salad bowl  bean paste condiments and some raw garlic & sliced hot peppers   to that  we added a plate of kimchi and an order of eggs for $3 each   the plate of kimchi was the most i've ever had at a korean restaurant  so was well worth it   i wasn't sure what shape or form the eggs would come in  but we received 3 pan fried eggs which were pretty much how i would cook them at home   you also have to order lettuce if you want to wrap your meat  we had a soon tofu soup  which came bubbling hot as it should   for the grill  we went with orders of the pork belly  marinated chicken and marinated steak  all pretty tasty   the steak was not as expected as it was just cubed beef   our servers were very attentive to putting the meat on the grill  turning it over and cutting to bite sized pieces   the three of us were still kind of hungry after the 3 meats and decided to order an additional bulgogi   the bulgogi was boneless  sliced and marinated but not dry grilled as at other kbbq places   it was served jungol style  brought out on a domed bronze platter placed right over the burner   as the meat  onions  scallions and mushrooms on top of the dome sizzled  the juices flowed down into the surrounding trough  which had broth in it to make a tasty soup   dip your spoon in   it's sweet  savory and delicious!i was disappointed that they didn't have kalbi on the menu  which is one of my favorites   add marinated beef short ribs to the menu  please!  also strange was that they also offer pho  which we didn't try  but maybe next time   street parking is cut throat in this neighborhood  just so you know  especially around dinner time 
more like 3 5 stars  this spot just recently opened nearby my house and i saw they had a $9 99 kbbq special so i had to go try it out  its located in an area where korean fare is abundant to say the least and the standard for good food at a good price is set very high  the competition is immense but only time will tell if they make it long term  me and my sister ordered the pork belly  bulgogi  and beef brisket along with two soondubus as a side  the meats were $10 each and the soondubu was $4 i think? it was smaller than a regular sized one but never the less filling  the pork belly was juicy and melted in your mouth after taking it off the grill  i usually dont like pork belly because i feel like its too tough and fatty whenever i get it  i was pleasantly surprised by the pork belly here though  the bulgogi was honestly terrible  there were so many pieces of fat and chewy tendon in it that i barely got any real meat out of it  that was a waste  the brisket was pretty decent but the plate went too quickly unfortunately  there wasn't anything special about the soondubu and the lettuce was an additional $3 to wrap the meat in  which i was kind of bummed about because it wasn't the best lettuce and that stuff is usually standard with any kbbq meal  im not sure if i would come back again because there are so many better places where the bill comes out to be the same but i leave more satisfied 
we came into this small restaurant for lunch today  left full and happy  and smelling like korean barbecue! the price is super reasonable for korean barbecue  the plates of meat are $9 99 lb of meat  we tried the premium beef steak  spicy pork belly and the bulgogi  my favorite is the spicy pork belly  so delicious  skip the bulgogi everything is priced a la carte including the basket of romaine lettuce $2 99 which is fine  the plates of barbecue meat is $9 99 pound which is an amazing deal and delicious  i am still thinking about the spicy pork belly the guy who helped us is nice  i believe he was the owner? the communication is lacking a little but hey the menu has photos so it's a point and order thing  it worked  there are sides on the menu but we were there for the meat! i would go back and just order two plates of the spicy pork belly again for myself  i guess i could share!
this is not a bad place if you want to eat a lot of meat! we came here because it is close to where big sister lives  and we just wanted some place that is walk able  it seems small from the outside  but there are plenty of seats on the inside  they don't have a huge ventilation system  but i am surprised by how it's not very smokey or overwhelmingly pungent  the menu is limited  which is actually a good thing  the prices are so cheap  we otherwise would have really just ordered too much! there isn't a whole lot of banchan    just a salad  you have to order kimchi separate  as well as any lettuce wraps or other sides  however  it isn't expensive  and we fed (overfed?) 6 people for less than $60  and it was majority meats  not bad  if you ask me!
extremely good price!! 9 99 for a 1lb or meat!!!the servers are extreamly nice and homely they speak both chinese and korean! amazing food!! and a big order of kimchi make it all the more better!
we went here for my dad's birthday for the grand opening  while the food was okay  i was very disappointed by how the servers treated us  there were only two waiteresses and it was a crowded weekend night  which was already a bad sign  but the main problem was that neither of the two waiters spoke english  they have signs on the wall saying that you grill your own meat  in actuality the waiters do it  but this was not explained  how this played out was that we were given a plate of raw meat and told not to use the grill  and then ignored given attitude when we tried to ask what was going on  the entire mood was ruined for the rest of the dinner because of this 
the meat is super good quality and not expensive at all  the staff are really nice people and the energy is very welcoming  i come only here for k bbq 
i lovee this place  it's really cheap and great to go with a small group of people and order a lot of meat and pho and share  the food is pretty good and the people are nice too!
very nice bbq place  the price is so cheap  and the meat quality is good  i was very impressed   love the premium steak
mika's always has a great vibe and they're open pretty late   my favorites are the beef brisket and the thin pork belly   the staff are very friendly  attentive and helpful   although it's not on the menu  they also have gyeran jin and japgokbap 
fantastic  i love the quality of the pork belly and they are thick and doesnt not smell at all  price is very adequate  so far ive only tried pork belly  beef brisket   beef pho  and marinated beef steak and all of them have been well above average  i would recommend
this place is really amazingi went for lunch  the price is very cheap but the meat and kimuchi are soooo good  the owner ms mika is a really nice person 
my intention is to give zero star  instead of one star  wait for more than five 5 mins  when the boss told us to wait 5 mins for the table  special $9 99 lb of the meats  but we don't believe it comes like one pound for us   we still have some meat on the pan  but the waiter took it away without asking us   marinated equal nothing  i believe the previous views are fake  not recommended at all
you must get the braised beef noodle soup  this broth has such a warm  homey feel  the braised beef is sweet and it melts in your mouth  i love getting it with the extra wide hand pulled noodles! the classic lanzhou beef noodle soup is also good if you like something saltier and meaty tasting  i don't think the lamb burger is really that good here  but the noodles are perfect for a cold  rainy day  i think it is a lot better than the lanzhou noodles in new world mall  in fact  i think this is my favorite place for hand pulled noodles in flushing  it has been really easy to get a seat during peak times when i have come here  the prices are also very reasonable  it's definitely worth the venture away from busy main street to grab a bite!
this place was   okay  we came in about a half hour before closing so it was just us and another party in the restaurant  the waiter could barely speak english  so when our food came  about a few minutes in  my boyfriend and i realized that they switched the noodles on us with the orders  i ordered the classic lanzhou beef noodle with regular noodles and my bf got the original beef noodle soup with thick noodles  being that it was our first time  we didn't have any clue as to what sizes our noodles were supposed to be  also considering the fact that theres five different sizes  it would still be hard to tell one apart from the other  we noticed when it was too late and we were halfway done with our bowls  anyways  my thick noodles were on the al dente side but i strongly doubt this was done intentionally lol  they needed to be cooked an extra 5 minutes i tell you  the broth (the entire bowl i should say)  was sort of bland with not much flavor going on at all  as for the meat  i was impressed  the beef slices were actually pretty thick  something i hardly see in noodle shops  the meat is usually very thin with a lot of fat on the edges  i can't say that about this place  one downfall  the bowls had an insufficient amount of meat  i was happy with the way the slices were cut  but not with the quantity of it  it also had zero flavor seasoning  maybe its supposed to absorb the broth and use that to give it flavor  but again  the broth lacked any flavor  my boyfriend was satisfied with his meal regardless of the noodle mistake (but he's a simple man satisfied with food as long as it tastes good)  he would go back  i  on the other hand would not  my stomach was hurting for the rest of the night  and not in a good way  which leads me to believe that something i ate was off  perhaps they leave the meat out too long before cooking? not sure and i'm not accusing anyone of anything but the food did not settle well with me and i've been to my fair share of noodle places  a restaurant making me not feel well afterwards is the only reason i need to not go back  regarding cleanliness  i wouldn't praise this place  during our dinner  they were sweeping towards the kitchen side which was only a few tables down from us  you start cleaning after you have closed up for the day  certainly not while customers are still there  while eating  i saw one of the cooks in the back (since there is no door) carry a large trash bin over his head from one side to the other  ummm   you are in a kitchen with food and utensils and counterspace out everywhere  a trashbin is well  a trash bin! dirt could be flying everywhere in those small 10 seconds  this had me very uneasy and uncomfortable and i struggled to finish my food afterwards  call me a neurotic but i am very particular about cleanliness and this restaurant  does not fit the bill  also  after viewing other photos of the food on yelp  i observed that they don't put much care into presenting a nice plate  it looks like they kind of just throw things ontop of the plate and serve it  with the food being disheveled and sloppy  makes me wonder how tidy their kitchen area is and how they keep the food and cooking equipment back there  the waiter did not come back the entire time after our food was served to us  we needed more napkins  more water  let me remind you that there were only two parties in the restaurant including us  we didn't tip  they didn't deserve it  overall  i would give them 2 5 stars but since you can't do half stars  its going up as a 2  i think they have alot they need to improve on 
she'll be cumin 'round the mountain when she comes   guess who's cumin to dinner?  i'm cumin out   see what i did there?  cumin may well be my favorite spice if only 'cause it lends itself so well to silly puns  well  okay  i also happen to like the distinctive smoky  musky flavor it brings to the party   it's a huge reason why i love cumin lamb   (duh )  and it's also why i'm a fan of cumin lamb burgers (double duh )  so when one of my yelp peeps insisted the cumin lamb burger from here was better than the now legendary one from xi'an famous foods  i was all over it i have to confess that i expected a fast casual concept here  as with xi'an famous foods    but this place  which provides wait service  is downright posh in comparison!  hubby and i decided to dine in  ordering some spicy potato vermicelli  in addition to a cumin lamb burger  the former featured noodles with this oddly compelling  slithery  rubbery texture   i was half tempted to let them slide right down my throat  skipping the whole chewing step altogether   they were tossed in a hot chili oil based sauce that was definitely spicy  i don't consider myself a lightweight  and this was pushing it for me in terms of heat   also  ftr  the noodles  which i believe were made from a potato based dough  were nowhere near the long  thin shape i associate with vermicelli  they were wide and thick  (minds out of the gutter  people) yeah  yeah   but what about the cumin lamb burger?  i have to say that overall  my yelp peep was right   the bun  in particular  was impressive and tasted freshly made  unlike some of the dry  stale specimens i've encountered at xi'an famous foods as it's grown more and more popular   the cumin lamb was tender and flavorful  but i wish there had been more of it   xi'an has always been pretty generous with its meat  if you will  so this seemed lacking   this sandwich arrived automatically wrapped in to go packaging so it must be a popular takeout order here while we were waiting  our friendly  attentive server plied us with some lovely gratis tea   our food took awhile so this was the perfect thing to placate us   bottom line  reasonably priced  thoughtfully executed food served up in a pleasant  cleanish space?  what a concept!  consider me a fan in the making   i need to return and try one of the noodle soups  clearly a popular pick  if all the steaming bowls of the stuff wafting by us during our visit were any indication   now  if only they served wine  )
came here for a lamb burger only  because i was already full from having ayce hot pot   so i'll have to come back for the noodles the lamb burger was really good   it had a lot of lamb in it and had a really pleasant lamb y flavor without being too gamey   there was just the right amount of cumin in it as well the "bun" itself was also good   it was soft and fluffy on the inside while being slightly crispy on the outside all the other food items looked great as well and i can't wait to come back to try them   alas  i just didn't have the stomach to eat a bowl of noodles after just having hot pot   i shall return soon!
love this place!! noodles are fresh and the broth is very tasty and comforting! i usually never finish a whole bowl of soup but i did here 
stealing lamb burgers from here generally lanzhou in jail  but you won't care  because they're that good duran duran even did a song about it  "cumin un dunhuang"it goes like this mine  immaculate lamb burger made with lamb and cumini've been waiting for thissigned (i paid for yours too)happy birthday to me and they made one for youcan't ever keep from eating 'til stuffed at the seamscan't i believe you're taking my lamb burger to piecesoh  it'll take a little timemight want to nibble minelet's cumin undunhuangwe'll try to stay blindto the homeless men outsidehey  child  stay while they make your foodfor now  have some of minelamb's what you need  lamb's what you lovewhen you come undunhuanglamb's what you need  lamb's what you lovewhen you cumin undunhuangfor me to say that something is the best thing i've tried in queens would be unthinkable  to even make the list of my 50 favorite things in this borough   which is literally my favorite place in the world to eat   is a miracle  and the little lamb cumin burger here is right on that list  i will grab one for people that i am showing around queens  i will get one whenever i'm in flushing  it's that good  it's actually significantly better than the famous one over at xi'an where the n1 is the real attraction not only is it superior  but it's delicious and uncomparable  also the service is really nice too  at least the young man serving me was an angel  and the prices are very fair  if you are in flushing come here and give it a try for yourself so next time your plane is going down  and sully miraculously lanzhou on the hudson river  swim to shore on the manhattan side  jump in a cab and give this place as your destination  after a bridge or tunnel or two (and i don't mean dating jersey boys)  you'll get here  and you'll try this  and you'll realize that miracles really do come in threes what's the third miracle  i hear you ask?well that's a different kind of beef noodle  at my place afterwards  but let's not talk about dessert 
2 stars for cleanliness  and that it's not very expensive first time here and i ordered the combo classic beef noodles with marinated egg & soda  the broth was decent  my noodles were cooked too long and became a little soggy  i had only 3 small pieces of meat  and a couple pieces of veggies  the "curly fries" were apparently meant to be raw or very very lightly boiled  and i didn't enjoy the dish at all  the toppings on it were just bits of meat and chili oil  cumin  etc  the taste couldn't make up for the fact i was eating a raw potato  workers here don't really speak english  so practice your mandarin  never coming back here  there is much tastier beef noodle soup in elmhurst  and other restaurants around 
when you come back to a place and you know what's good from experience and can also choose something new from the menu with a solid expectation that it will be good? this explains my 5 star rating for this restaurant  cold eggplant salad is fresh  zestfully seasoned with garlic and scallions  spicy lamb burger  big plate chicken  braised beef noodle are my favorites; hearty dishes with authentic flavor  be assertive when getting wait staff attention and set service expectations lower (or at par with downtown flushing)  this way you will enjoy your food here more!
absolutely excellent  the spicy beef noodle soup was huge and flavorful  the chicken wings were moist and spicy and the dumplings were delicious  you should go 
the food was good  about 3 stars  your good decent bowl of pulled noodles  broth was decent  if you had the jajang noodles  the sauce definitely enhanced the noodles  but let's talk about service  the service was 1 star  why? i definitely saw blatant racism from the waitress  i walked in as a group of 3 asians  it was fairly empty  right before the rush hour  they seated us and that was it  our table had only two settings and we had no menus  this went on for a good 5 minutes and the place began to crowd  i grabbed another napkin chopstick set from the next table over to give it to our third person  8 minutes in  we finally flagged someone down to give us menus  meanwhile  there was a lady that was playing with plastic containers and ignoring anyone that needs her service (get someone else if you can't help us)  back to the racist waitress  she refused to give us eye contact and took orders from 3 parties that sat down after us  i try to get attention from a staff handling takeout  he acknowledged me but did nothing (like it's not his job) when we finally flagged down the racist lady to take our order  i notice she  and most of the other staff  were particularly polite to their white and hispanics customers  odd  our 4th friend finally came in to join us  he was greeted  promptly given a setting and menu and he order was taken seamlessly  he was guyanese  i've never seen racist lady so polite and courteous!  even takeout boy was there to help out in the order of if he needed anything extra  plastic container lady was still playing with her plastic containers though  as we left the restaurant  i can't help but wonder what made our 4th friend so special  was it because he was a guy? did he looked like a food blogger? did he look rich? or is it just because he wasn't asian? did we look cantonese? were they racist to just cantos? why does this still exist?no matter  not coming back again  but if you read the other reviews for this place  you'll notice the varying degrees of customer service   now you know why 
had the braised beef noodle and lamb burger  both excellent but way overpriced for flushing  the lamb burger is very tiny  i wish i would've bought like 3 of them  i will return here because it was one of the best beef noodle soups that ive had in the area and their lamb burger is very very good 
wow  if you look through my history you'll see that i'm pretty sheisty with the 5 star reviews  but this place definitely deserves it  i came here with my family during their visit to the city  i came to flushing not really knowing where we were going to eat  looking through yelp  we found this place with its glorious 4 5 star rating and knew that we just had to give it a try  we came around dinner time on a saturday night and found the place to be busy but not completely packed  the restaurant itself is simple but clean  we sat down and were handed the menus which had a decent number of items on it but wasn't overwhelming  we ordered a few noodle dishes  the lamb burger  the eggplant dish  and the cold chicken dish you can choose the type of noodles you want  ranging from thin to extra wide  original beef noodle   we got the nonspicy version  the broth was one of the most flavorful i've had  the noodles were a perfect aldente  we got the regular noodles  the beef was tender cold noodles   spicy and savory noodles  these were my favorite  i could probably eat 2 to 3 bowls of these if left to my own devices and freed from the shackles of society fat shaming  got these extra thin but they were better with wide noodles vegetable noodles   this is the only dish i would not order again  the vegetables were a bit cold when they weren't meant to be  the noodles were hot  however  the sauce is soy based and nice but the vegetables weren't seasoned well  the whole dish just didn't come together well  avoid if possible we got a second order of the beef and cold noodles the cold eggplant and chicken dish were excellent and i would definitely order again  chicken dish especially was just the right amount of spicy the lamb burger was delicious  bread was light and crunchy  lamb was well seasoned and full of cumin as promised the service here is excellent and the staff are all extremely friendly and helpful  if you think you know what service at a new york city chinese restaurant is like then i challenge you to try this place  it will definitely change your mind the prices are all extremely reasonable  most menu items are under $10 with the exception of a few lamb dishes i cannot wait to come here again!
quick service  affordable  and many delicious options! i tried the original beef noodle soup (2) and chongqing noodle soup (6)  and i loved both! i like spicy food but i cannot eat it well   that being said  the chongqing soup was the perfect level of spicy for me  the original beef noodle  however  is my favorite and a must try! the only downsides to this place is that there's a $20 card minimum and that a can* of sprite costs $2  which is both a lot compared to other places 
great option to warm up on a cold winters day! i got the classic beef noodle soup  with a side of eggplant salad  the soup looked simple  but the broth was wonderfully flavorful! i wasn't sure how i felt about the eggplant salad after the first bite  but it definitely got more flavorful with each additional bite! since it was a little past lunch time  there was no wait and i was seated right away  the staff was friendly  and the prices very fair  would definitely go back!
hit this place up the other day for dinner with a friend   we went around 8 oclock and were seated without a wait   the place is pretty small but clean and chilling i got the zha jiang mian ($8 50)   it came out pretty fast   all in all  it was very tasty   the noodles were cooked pretty well (not too chewy or too soft) and the sauce was pleasant; fairly thick and meaty   the only issue i had was that the portion size was so damn small   i finished it in a few bites and was like damn  i can easily eat like 2 more bowls and i wasn't even that hungry   service was unremarkable like most other chinese places in flushing; quick but not very friendly   so i'll give this 3 stars   if the portion size was better i'd gladly give this 4 or even 5 stars cause it was definitely good 
i love pho so i decided to give this place a try  good reviews on yelp the place is nice and clean and service was attentive i tried the original beef noodle soup  there were only 3 ot 4 very small slices of beef  way less than what you get in a vietnamese restaurant  you also don't get the side of fresh basil  bean sprouts  lime or jalapeno peppers  there was a little bit of cilantro included  the reason for the 3 star is that the broth was watery and didn't have much taste and the noodle were lumped together  smaller than average portion also they don't have the lamb noodles anymore 
it's a pretty good noodle shop  3 5 star i'd say  small  casual and quick  the hand pull noodles have different sizes  from almost hair thin to wide as a finger  the taste is fine  the seaweed salad is delicious  tender and juicy  i would return if in the mood of noodle  they are opposite from the huge public parking lot 
simply the best beef noodle shop in flushing   the handmade noodle game is strong in flushing with lots of competition (especially in food courts)   hand pulled noodles are the in thing right now and sometimes it's easy to feel like they are all created equal   they are not dunhuang is a bit off the beaten path  a bit further away from the downtown food centers but certainly within a quick walk of the usual places people like to eat in flushing   what makes this place better than others are the incredible broth and fresh and excellent noodles  the spicy cabbage is a little spicy and a tad sour  reminiscent of kim chi without the fermented funk   the spicy vermicelli on the other hand is swimming in red hot pepper oil and while a bit bland on the salt spectrum  has a huge pungent spicy punch   eating the vermicelli together with the cabbage is a nice contrast of spicy  sour  hot and cold   the best bite here by far however is the spicy beef noodle soup   the broth looks unassuming but good lord is it deep   dunhuang's beef broth is the standard   it's the perfect balance of spicy  pungent and sweet and i have to imagine that the chefs here spend in inordinate amount of time making it   couple that with the freshly hand pulled thin noodles  it is just a incredibly satisfying bite   the chefs here pull the noodles thin rather than flat and fat which makes the noodles perfect rather than gummy  which can happen at other establishments   the beef brisket was tender with just the right amount of fat   prices here are no higher than the food courts but the restaurant is amazingly clean and staff here is super attentive and friendly   being able to also sit at your own table and not fight the masses for a seat in a germ infested food court also makes me happy   did i mention that they also take credit card?  i was kind of past the whole lanzhou hand pulled noodle phase but this place has sucked me back in   two big thumbs up  solid 4 5 stars 
went on a chilly friday night and it really hit the spot! i loveeee noodles so i'm a little bias but it was soo good  me and my friends ordered either the classic beef noodle or spicy beef noodle  some with egg but you have to pay extra for that  the noodles were pretty thin and the broth was so flavorful  good amount of beef as well but we all have big appetites so one bowl of noodles was not as filling as i had hoped  definitely will be back though to try their other items on the menu!
i had lanzhou beef noodle for the first time in china and wanted to try how they did it in the us  the braised beef noodle soup was delicious with tender morsels of beef in a flavorful soup base  we also ordered the non spicy version for the kids and the soup base was just as flavorful with tender slices of meat  the noodles were super thin  should have ordered slightly thicker noodles  we also ordered the "super spicy" cold been noodles  we liked it  but it wasn't too spicy  it was mildly spicy with lots of chili oil  we got the spicy cumin lamb burger and the pork burger; flavorful and the bread was crispy along the edges  for the spicy one  i would have liked chopped green chilis  we finished dinner with a try if their fermented oat cold "soup " it was unique  but wouldn't order it again  the restaurant is clean and spacious  hostess and waiters were pleasant  also  it's right across from the parking lot  not as comparable as the one in china as their menu is quite limited  especially if they feature hand made noodles 
i gave this place a second chance after 2 years and somehow it's completely reversed my first experience  now i think it's quite the best chinese noodle house in flushing  the menu is simple with a couple types of noodles  bunch of salads and lamb chop  somehow i felt like the menu was different from the first time i went  anyway  my friend and i got the classic lanzhou noodle soup  braised beef noodle soup  cucumber salad and potato salad  omg  the broth is bomb!!! it was so flavorful  to get that natural sweetness the beef bones must've gone through hours and hours of broiling with spices and herbs  i appreciate this broth so much  the beef was tender and the noodle was freshly cut  you can tell  cilantro and chili oil added for more flavor  i didn't try my friends' braised beef noodle but she loved it too  it came with bok choy also  the cucumber salad had a strong taste of garlic and was fun to eat (crunchy)  potato salad was okay  i remember having the lamb chop before but it wasn't so tasteful  i don't care! here for the noodle soup! price is really cheap  ~$8 for a bowl and they even have a combo of $10 50 something for a bowl of noodle soup  a salad or side dish  a boiled egg and a soda  they're gonna be seeing me a lot this summer 
tried it for the first time  food was fantastic and very authentic  noodles were very tasty  and it's reasonably priced! we had lamb skewer  beef noodle  pork burger  and liang fen cold noodle 
simple menu  got the original beef noodle soup  spicy braised beef noodle soup  chicken wings and the multi sliced beef with cilantro  they give really little meat in the noodle soup  broth wasn't thick but flavorful  noodles were nice and chewy the sliced beef was delicious! it wasn't drowning in chili oil  it was thinly sliced and every bite was bursting with flavors  chicken wings reminds me of thai fried wings because it was a tangy sour taste  wings were juicy but it was so fatty and meat had not texture 
the lamb burger is very delicious  but the chongqing noodle is not authentic at all  the other lamb dish we ordered are very good as well 
i was craving some spicy beef noodle soup on a cold  wintry night and found dunhuang on yelp   i was a bit hesitant initially due to the odd feeling that i was getting from photos  but glad i found my way in there   we waited about 15 20 minutes for a table for two as that place was packed!  thank goodness customers were slurping their noodles away  making our wait a little more tolerable i ordered myself the braised beef noodle soup and my other half ordered the classic  we also ordered the eggplant salad and spicy cumin lamb burger for starters   soon after  our eggplant salad arrived and i gobbled the dish down in a heartbeat   it was cooked so simply  but yet so flavorful  appetizing and delicious!  i also loved my spicy braised beef noodle soup   it looked a bit intimidating at first because the broth was red  but it was very satisfying to my spicy cravings   beef was also rather tender and the noodles (which were supposedly hand pulled) were elastic and freshly made   my other half enjoyed the classic beef noodle soup  but i felt that my bowl was more savory  )   we didn't get to eat the lamb burger since we were full from our noodles  but i did take a small bite and found it well spiced my only complaint was the language barrier with the staff members  most  if not all  didn't speak english well  making it difficult to communicate   nonetheless  i would return again 
have been to this place at least 5 times and it's definitely one of my favorite hand pull noodles places in flushing  the dunhuang lanzhou beef noodles were originally from lanzhou  100% authentic sand local  their ingredients packs for the soup are shipped all the way from their restaurant in lanzhou  and had opened almost 10 chain restaurants in the states  another one near columbia university  i asked them if they ever thought about making the ingredients packs open for sale so we can also cook at home  but the answer is no at least for now  really want to find out what's in there tho! i personally love cooking at home but this would not be easy to prepare as in the beef soup usually takes hours to boil  their traditional hand pull noodles are so good i always get  once you get something good you keep getting it! i also recommend to have traditional chinese red oil pickles together to enjoy the beef noodle soup  creating the mixture taste of thickness of the soup as well as the sour from pickles are just sooo good 
noodles texture    amazing extra 2 dollars and you're able to double the portion for noodles they also refill your soup if it seems lacking  waiters are also super nice the only thing that i was a little upset about was the saltiness of the soup  will be coming back again for other types of noodles though  overall happy and satisfied  )
excellent beef soup noodle!!!' i drink up all the soup!!!!! it's the authentic chinese  northwest style  which reminds me the time i was there highly recommend!!!!
randomly saw this place and decided i had to try it since lam zhou in manhattan closed down  first impression is that it is super clean  i tried the prime beef noodle soup  it was a clean broth and the beef was tender  i think it depended a little bit too much on the chili oil to give it a real kick though  i also ordered the lamb sandwich which was plain and sad  it seemed to be missing some spices but was strong in lamb flavor  i kept adding chili oil and vinegar to it to try and make it better  a solid go to go noodle soup!
not too far from the main street stop on the 7 line  i chose dun huang to be where i lost my lanzhou hand pulled virginity  the restaurant itself is clean and the staff is quite friendly  best of all  however  is that they accept card which is a thankful chance of pace from the typical "cash only" fare service (3 5)while i said that the staff is affable  there were several glaring turnoffs  principally  water service was really delayed; water was not served until i explicitly asked for it  when the water did arrive  it was lukewarm and had that awful toilet water taste  not too pleasant! that's not to ignore that my water was never refilled food (4 25 5)original beef noodle soup (3 5 5)  i suppose i was expecting it to be extraordinary  but it was incredibly underwhelming to me  the broth had an overwhelming aniseed flavor from the star anise that uncomfortably blanketed the noodles and broth instead of piquing my senses  the noodles had a good consistency  but i found the beef a little on the tough side cumin braised lamb (5 5)  is it possible to give this more than a 5 5? this was bar none  one of the best things i've ever had in flushing  the lamb is so delicate  fatty  and tender  and the subdued gaminess couples with the cumin with an incredible fragrance that is indescribable  with the sweetness of the bell peppers as well as the well formed thick noodles  this dish is absolutely worth the ~$30 it costs  despite leaving dun huang with staggeringly full bellies  i found myself craving another bite of the braised lamb altogether  i thought that very little distinguishes dun huang as a superb restaurant  yet  simply because of the cumin braised lamb  i know that i will soon find my way back here 
noodles are on point  you can tell it's fresh by how chewy the noodles are  side dishes are good also  came late so no more skewers  will be back to try it next time 
food  3 5  mediocre at best  i thought lanzhou beef noodle was supposed to be mild in taste  it was way too spicy to the point i cannot taste any other flavor  services  1 5  the waitress was not professional   i came in on a weekday morning to try out their lanzhou beef noodle after all the hypes on yelp  initial impression was favorable  the restaurant looked clean  well organized  and the waitress greeted me the first instance she saw me  however  it went downhill from there  i asked for a chair seating and she insisted on a booth because "it was more comfortable"  okay  i guess she knew my comfort preference more than i do  anyway  i went for the lanzhou beef noodle  cabbage  and soda combo and a side order of spicy cumin lamb burger  the waitress never asked me for the style of noodle on the menu  what kind of soda  and the level of spiciness  strike two  i found the spicy cumin lamb burger pretty alright  not the greatest but not bad either  though my all time favorite goes to the one in the basement food court  anyway  the beef noodle was way too spicy  i cannot really taste any other flavor other than the spiciness  there were only 3 4 pieces of thinly sliced beef  and i highly doubt the noodle was "hand pulled"  lastly  when i tried to pay for the meal  the waitress insisted on cash payment despite presenting a tray that said "discovery card accepted here"  i am fully supportive of small business and don't mind paying cash  however  i was a bit turned off by their business practice  nowhere in their restaurant did they said only cash payment or minimum credit card swipe  overall  if you enjoy a clean restaurant with somewhat decent food off the beaten path  i recommend giving them a try and see how you like it  i know for sure i wouldn't be going back 
when we went in at 6pm on a weekday  there wasn't a lot of people  also  there wasn't a lot of choices for non spicy food  we ordered the classic lanzhou beef noodle  original beef noodle  and spicy cumin lamb burger  personally  i don't really like the texture of the noodles as they were too hard to chew and they don't give you enough slices of beef for the price that they charge  the burger was okay  maybe it's just not my taste  however  their customer service was good 
i love the noodles here  you can pick the type of noodle you want  i love the chongking noodles  the broth is red from the chili oil  the super spicy vermicelli are good too  though they're very heavy on the spice and sezchuan pepper  so stay away if that's not your thing  the service has been variable  but nowhere near terrible  the trek to flushing is totally worth it!
the beef noodle soup regular is chewy & soup taste good   not too spivey the chicken wings taste ok but 5 for $8 is a lot!there's place is nice size not too noisy
overpriced noodles had the eggplant which tasted ok but was overpriced for what it was  chilled eggplant in oily sesame sauce the beef noodles i tried for the first time (their signature lanzhou dish) had tasteless broth and the noodles were similar to those found in the flushing mall  except they were several dollars more expensive because this place is a sit down joint hot tea they serve is watered down   tastes like water with a hint of tea  they're probably reuse the same small amount of tea leaves to make four days worth of tea  their bathroom smells strongly of piss  though they do have a lot of toilet paper in stock 
went for dinner on a friday night and the restaurant was pretty crowded  we were seated right away but had to wait a bit to get the menu and then again for our order to be taken  had the n1  which was pretty standard  overall  a pretty good place for hot noodles on a cold night  but the service could be better 
i come to this restaurant on a regular basis but one thing that keeps nagging me is that  no one really can speak english in this restaurant making ordering difficult  moreover this is the third time they did not bring back the change when i paid for the food  i believe it should be up to the customer to decide how much tip to give  not the restaurant's
i usually have the korean ver of the zhajiang mian called jajjangmeon  but this place's zhajiang mian is pretty good and flavourful  the eggplant is pretty nice too if you're ok with a mouthful of garlic after taste  my hubby tried the original beef noodles and the soup had a nice peppery spice taste common to the northern china cuisine  decent place if you're in the mood to slurping noodles 
good service  good clean  good taste soup  everyone can try adding eggs  such a soup will be sweeter 
i like the dunhuangs noodle，is very good。i 've never had such a good noodle soup，and good service。
this is the most authentic lanzhou noodles i have had in the us   and i have tried at least 20 places between los angeles and new york  the ingredients  from the soup to the beef to the chili sauce  is as close to what i've tried in china as possible with that being said  i'm not a fan of the side dishes  i would recommend just the noodles 
wonderful  second time here  good noodles  slow cooked tender beef  rich broth served super fast  had the braised beef noodle soup and lamb cumin burger  my gf had the garlic eggplant app and tomato noodle soup  also very good  our check was $29 with tax  very cheap considering the quality  love this place 
love this place!!     had a blind date with a biracial korean   tiwanese woman    and this place rocks!!!!    i had the classic lanzhou beef noodles      and it was perfect!  it could have had more beef in the order  however it was perfectly cooked and just spicy enough     you can dine in  or do take out    and the quality of food is 10    ambiance = 9 0       the tables are strategically placed not to close to each other    so you can defiantly have a date   romantic conversation      and the music is not to loud either     waiter   waitress very attentive  and extremely knowledgeable on foods    and they check back with you   to make sure you're comfortable      location is nice  close to downtown flushing  queens just 2 1 2 blocks from the flushing (7) train stop   there's even a dessert place just 1 block away    oh   and there's parking in a parking garage just 2 blocks away       cost $$  monderatly priced    and they have cold dishes as well  such as the eggplant salad w  garlic & soy sauce 
mmmm as far as hand pulled noodles go  this place is a must try  fresh big bowl of noodles with savory stews  i'm not a huge spicy fan so i opted for the original beef noodle soup  i really enjoyed the broth  after a long day  this just hit the spot my friends got two versions of spicy beef noodle soup (one with chili oil and one with peanut oil)  they both seem to really enjoy the bowl too  i like how they give you lots of noodles so you can just keep slurping and slurping for sides we got cucumber & garlic and multi slices of beef  delicious and savory! the only dish i didn't really enjoy was the spicy cumin lamb burger  it was too much bread  little dry and not enough filling  nevertheless  i'm excited to come back for that big bowl of soup again 
the noodles are a good texture and looks to be freshly made  we ordered two bowls of noodles and 2 side dishes  noodles are great and the sides are good size with a gentle taste  price wise  very affordable and the place is clean  also the bathroom is super clean as well! we all know we hate those dingy bathrooms so this was a plus as well   )the service is meh  water and tea isn't refilled and they walk around a bit aimlessly  but the food is good so it's definitely worth dropping by 
the eggplant dish is amazing  the boiled (?) lamb was super tasty and tender  the noodles were good too  friends enjoyed the shredded potato too  next time i'll try the beef noodle soup nice comfortable sit down restaurant  so it's a good option if people don't want to eat at the food court 
good bowl of spicy beef noodles! everything is pretty cheap and looked really good  i would come back to try their different noodles  they also have a thickness option of thin  regular  wide or extra wide noodles! the only bad thing was the service  the waiters weren't very attentive and i had to call one multiple times to get their attention to refill our water 
my everyday lunch place  my favorite is there niang pi  a kind of cold noodle with sesame sauce and garlic  aside from their signature beef noddle  they also have good pork belly noodle  i also like the eggplant dish a lot  though the garlic is a little bit too strong 
tl dr  the worst customer service i've ever experienced and i wouldn't come here even if the food was amazing  i came here once with a group of friends and it was fine  noodles were good but we were the only group there so of course the service was fine i came here a second time with my mom  we sat down  a waiter came over and we said we weren't ready  a few minutes later  another waiter came over and we ordered  we waited 30 minutes and my mom asked them to check on our food 3 times  each time they said it's coming sorry for the wait  it's coming  a waiter finally actually realized that the waiter didn't register our food  we sat there for 30 minutes and then he blamed us  "i asked at first  but you didn't order"  1) if we rejected you the first time  were you never going to come back? 2) our menus were gone  did we just throw them in the trash somehow? no we ordered through another waiter obviously  3) we asked you to check 3 times and you didn't  how do you explain that? we left  obviously  worst place ever  if they had taken responsibility  it wouldn't have been so frustrating  but they made us wait 30 40 minutes for water 
yum! awesome noodles  spicy and many good choices  felt like i was back in dunhuang! good for people who like spicy but also non spicy lovers too  my buddy really enjoyed the noodles 
honestly they have one of the best noodles i've ever tasted  you can tell since they have clear glass kitchen kneading the dough right in front of you  i think no matter which noodle bowl you end up going with you'll be quite pleased with the quality of the noodles personally i tried their prime noodles soup and had a fantastic meal  besides the super fresh noodles  the beef slices and broth were both quite excellent  i ended up adding chilis to it since i think they felt a bit light if you didn't go with the spicy version  also had tried their cold noodles and that was simply wonderful as well  those two would be my highly recommended menu items it was a large group so we ended up getting quite a number of hot and cold appetizers  the lamb chops were a bit pricey as expected but i think they fried it quite well  if you don't mind the extra greasiness and full slice of lamb with the fat its quite large plate  the cold chicken were another favorite of mine pretty authentic and quite spicy if you have the stomach for it being a relatively new restaurant  the seating areas are very clean and very update to date  the food came out in relatively quick fashion despite our large party of 12+ we did had to ask the servers for some help at certain points but they were always helpful and never forgot what we asked 5 stars just for their noodle line ups and honestly i think even if they don't offer any appitizers people would still be coming to this newly establishments in droves  the noodle prices are quite attractive on par with many food court food prices here  the portion and quality of the food for the price is really something quite exceptional  i hope they have many many years of success and i see myself becoming a regular here on my visits to flushing 
perfect classic lanzhou noodles  got the combo meal of lanzhou beef noodles in soup  an egg  some pickled cabbage  and a drink  you could tell the noodles were freshly pulled and cooked  the broth was perfectly light yet full of savory beef flavor  there were some bokchoi to round it out  the egg was great  the pickled cabbage were great  definitely worth adding like the extra dollar or two for a total of like $10  service was very fast  it was great to be able to sit down in an ac place in the summer  definitely come here 
food  4 0 5 0service  2 5 5 0value  3 0 5 0decor  3 0 5 0overall  4 0 5 0wow   the bowl of lanzhou style beef hand pulled noodles legit tastes like the stuff i've had on the streets in the motherland   great job for bringing a little bit of noodle authenticity to flushing    deserving of your 4 5 5 0 yelp star average as of june 2016   i can't quite get to five stars myself because beef la mian is fundamentally not really a five star dish   anyone who doesn't give this place at least four either didn't have the noodles (which is the point of this place) or hasn't had them in china for reference   i was close to ordering a second bowl and will be back 
full disclaimer  i was born in lanzhou  and real lanzhou beef noodles have ruined everything else for me i've searched everywhere for the authentic lanzhou beef noodle experience  if you've experienced the real deal  you know what i'm talking about  the chew of the noodles  the oh my god they must put cocaine in this chili sauce and the deceptively light yet flavorful broth  it's a seemingly very simple dish on paper that is maddeningly difficult to replicate in practice sadly  this place did not deliver on the goods i really had my hopes up  there was house made chili oil and a bottle of vinegar on every table  the og accoutrements  the menu allowed you to specify noodle thickness just like in lanzhou  unfortunately  the noodles while indeed handmade  did not have the same bite i was expecting and were a bit soggy  while the chili oil was very close to the real deal  the broth was still somehow a bit off  maybe what they say about nyc pizza also applies to lanzhou noodles  it's something in the water  perhaps?the closest i have ever been to experiencing lanzhou beef noodle nirvana outside of lanzhou was in of all places a hole in the wall store in montreal  which unfortunately apparently has since closed alas  the quest continues  (
my mom actually discovered this noodle spot after getting tired of eating in dirty food courts around flushing for lan zhou noodles  this place is clean and new  but its really hot inside  like all year  i went in the winter time and it was probably 80 degrees inside and went again during the summer and no ac was on then either  eating spicy noodles in boiling hot broth with no ac is pretty uncomfortable  the price is reasonable for any noodle spot in flushing but the broth itself just tasted super salty with barely a hint of spice  the noodles were done well but the broth will leave you wanting alot of water to drink  the wait staff also disregards you if you need anything after they deliver your order to the table  they also seem to only care about their own tables too  my mom asked a girl helping the table next to us for a glass of water and she just said "you aren't my table" in chinese  ok  i guess 
i would not recommend this noodle spot。 their version of the big tray chicken was unimpressive  the wide noodles tasted fake and commercially made and was just cheap drummette type chicken。felt so ripped off!  our party of 5 didnt even want to finish it  def skip this dish  their zhazhang mian was good but i felt they skimped on the noodles  sauce was decent def not the best i had。 they also skimped on the meat of the braised beef noodle。 i would not come back!
wonderful noodle place  the spicy braised beef noodle  cold noodle dish  and the cumin lamb burgers were excellent and portions were just right  definitely coming back!!
had the classic beef noodle  which was great tasting and they let you choose the size of your noodles  the eggplant dish is a great supplement to the noodles!the lamb burger was vastly overrated in my opinion  it was basically a regular chinese bun with lamb in the middle  but wasn't very flavorful 
great noodles and flavor  you get to choose your noodle size  nice and clean restaurant  very tender meat  and not heavy  but not super light where it taste like you ate nothing  i live in the area and was looking for a noodle place instead of traveling all the way downtown brooklyn   now i will be a regular!
legit  hand drawn spicy noodle soup  broth was amazing especially on a cold day  spicy lamb burger was closest to the one i've had in xi'an since  i've visited   lamb skewers are killer 
well  considering the fact that i'm from taiwan  a country known for beef noodles  i think my recommendation would be pretty trustworthy!
add on comment on 6 12 2017i visited chinatown location today and accidentally met the owner  we discussed what had happened to me the other day  and he explained and apologized  apology accepted and will definitely go back for noodles and eggplants                                  i didn't order a new bowl of soup like jenny had explained on the response though  comments on 3 17 2017i went for lunch today with my family  and i ordered an original beef noodle soup  i finished the soup but still left some noodles  so i asked for some soup  the waitress said okay and came with a bowl of soup  i asked if they charged for the soup and she said yes  i was surprised because last time  a few months ago  i asked for a bowl of soup and it was free  so i said it was free last time  they said the owner made the decision  at this point three staff were by our table  listening to my complaints  finally i said okay give me the owner's contact info i wanted to talk to him  i used a tone of joke and was not that serious  they walked away and i thought they were going to give me the info but they just left me alone with no explanation  i was sitting there and no one ever came back to me with any words or contact info  i have to say the food is good  the service is not bad  but the way they handle customer relationship is terrible  and i really don't think $2 5 for a bowl of soup is a wise decision  i hope the owner could read this 
do not order the dunhuang lamb chops  they are not worth the price  it is just lamb boiled and seasoned with some salt  and bok choy on the bottom  and the workers are but slow so be patient  but overall the noodles were delicious  we ordered two classic lanzhou beef noodles 
came with some friends on a cold winter night  i got the classic beef noodle soup with extra soup for $2 5  the service was quick and there were many options  you even got to select the size of the noodle 
noodles are good  but the service was terrible  it took at least 10 minutes for our party to be seated even though there were a bunch of tables open  one waitress was serving everyone  and she did not seem experienced  there was a runner  but he did a whole lot of nothing  there was a guy who looked a manager standing around  but he had no idea what to do with himself  he kept trying to help the waitress  but was clueless  for example  at one point he was following the waitress  and she had to tell him to answer the phone  all this led to our food taking forever to come out  to make matters worse  they have a 10 minute video about chinese food playing on loop  after the third loop i wanted to get up and leave  then the noodles came out and they were good 
love this place  spicy beef noodle soup is definitely a must and their buns are freshly made as well
simple and clean and incredibly yummy noodle shop   one of my favorites in flushing  the service is typical of chinatown  the menu is intentionally small which means every dish is great 
service is good  food is authentic and delicious  it is definitely very popular so you have to wait about 15 minutes to be seated  be sure to get their early!
cuisine  7service  7decor  6value  7overall  7more restaurant than just a noodle shop  though its menu is quite limited   what they do have mostly taste pretty darn good  especially the julienne potato and garlic eggplant cold appetizers  fried lamb ribs  side of braised pork and the spicy noodles   it's also a quite part of downtown flushing  so there is usually quick seating   the service is much better than typical of this neighborhood and the restaurant feels clean (still brand new) 
food is very good  the noodle is amazing  i love the soup also  i hope they will have more franchises and i can eat near my home 
this place has one of the best beef noodle soups i have ever tasted! i got the classic beef noodle soup  the broth is so flavorful and has the right amount of spiciness  you can also try different types of noodles from thin to extra thick  i love the noodles; they're chewy but not hard  i can't wait to come back and try other noodle dishes on the menu! the service was ok but that's expected for an authentic chinese restaurant  they also have a $20 minimum for cards  but if you tell them you don't have enough cash  they'll go ahead and process the payment with card anyways 
one of the best authentic chinese restaurant located in flushing that you must try!!! they were really busy when we were visiting  all tables have been taken so we waited a little bit and we loved it!! they have noodles  fried dishes and cold side dishes that you can choose  everything is so yummmmmmmy!
everything here was very seasoned with god knows what  flavor enhancements?! well whatever it is    it made all our dishes taste so good  super fatty and oily  definitely comfort food 
food was delicious  service was only ok  slow to take order and no refill of water tea  we got 2 apps    pickled potato sticks $4   i liked this a lot  it's also a bit spicy but not much  it was refreshing    beef slices   $9   a nice plate of thinly sliced beef slices with chili oil  it's so good! nicely flavored and comes with some raw cilantro mixed in for my main dish  i got the spicy beef noodle soup combo $10   which comes with a braised egg in the soup and also a pickled cabbage app and a soda  the cabbage app was delicious with a slight kick and it was crunchy vinegary fresh  the soup was really great  the broth had a lot of depth and was nice and clear and the noodle freshly pulled and toothy  there were about 5 slices of beef in the soup too with a bunch of well cooked daikon slices   hubsy got the lu mian which is is a hybrid between soupy noodle and dry noodle  it has a lot of sauce with a bunch of vegetables   cauliflower  fried tofu  wood ear  seaweed  and some green veg   the total was ~$32 pre tax  a bit pricey but we were stuffed to the rim so probably a good deal 
delicious and not expensive at all  lan zhou cuisine is a bit hot and spicy  the cold appetizer are refreshing and not oily  just the garlic is on the heavy side 
this is definitely the best lanzhou lamian place i had in new york  it reminds me of the old days in beijing  i hope there are more and more good and authentic chinese food in new york!
food was delicious and quick glad i found this gem and will definitely be back  on a cold night the noodles will hit the spot  their hand pulled noodles were perfectly chewy!
pro  they take credit card with no minimum yet (no amex)   very transparent kitchen that let's you see their activities inside  a manager on the floor  with 3 chefs  one hostess  one waiter and one clean up girl soup a little saltier than i'd prefer but not bad  this isn't something light  their soup is heavily based on the abundance of seasoning to get the flavors  their beef is cooked long enough to melt in your mouth  the few slices of white radish was cooked just right  leaving a light sweetness in every bite  the hostess who took my order told me the noodles aren't spicy but i clearly tasted some light spiciness while eating and my tongue is left with a slight numb sensation     so she doesn't her products yet with the amount of hand stretched noodles places all over flushing and esp  at a lower price point    this place left me disappointed     not to mention   they didn't even offer tea for starters until i was more than 75% done with my food  they are new so i gave 3stars to give them a chance otherwise  not a fan yet  a star for the new interior and the ceramic utensils a star for friendly service  tho not professional enough 
awesome noodle soup   must eat it when every time come to ny  the dessert also so good! but my favorite is the chili oil!! high recommendation!!
delicious  stumbled upon this spot in flushing and i must say   i'm glad we walked in  we got the classic lanzhou noodles for $6 95  it had the perfect amount of spice and the beef wasn't undercooked or overcooked  it was the perfect amount of spice and cilantro  we also got the lanzhou cumin lamb bun  they brought it to us after we finished our noodles which i thought was a little strange since it was an appetizer  but it ended up working out because i ate it with the rest of my soup broth  i would definitely come back here to satisfy my noodle craving  the staff seemed super friendly and the place is also super clean  they also have a rolling video of how the hand pulled noodles were made and about the culture which was nice 
came here on a saturday night  and ordered two originals  (6 95 each) one of them we made into a combo which comes cabbage  an egg  an a  can of soda for an extra 3 dollars more  the noodle soup had a lot more pepper than i wouldve liked but it was all right  the noodle soup did not come with much meat  and we ordered another dish just for meat  we also got a side of cucumbers  and it was refreshing with the noodle soup 
good price with good soup noodle!!!highly recommended
ordered niangpi  tastes really good  the spicy and the saltiness is just right  i finished half before realize taking a photo  also  got the classic lanzhou beef noodle  the soup and the noodle are tasty but the beef is a bit chewy  not soft enough   and the spicy cumin lamb burger came last  it is ok  not outstanding  so far this is the best lan zhou restaurant i have had and i will definitely come back again 
the braised beef noodle here is fantastic  dare i say better than xian famous foods  the noddles are fresh and glutinous  cooked to a perfect al dente  the broth is what sets this place apart    it was flavorful  not too salty and clean drinkable  the braised beef was really  really good    slow roasted and succulent  i'll definitely be back  even if that means an hour long trip from manhattan 
dollar sign is a misconception it's actually 2 dollar signs  ordered the lamb noodles that has a portion size for like 2 people  waitress told me it's good for three people when clearly it wasn't  noodles came cold  meat came hot   noodles didn't taste freshly made  more like cold and just placed in  the lamb tasted good tho  very soft and tender  didn't taste superb but didn't taste bad either  had one regular portion with two sides  over bill came to 60 dollars with tax and tip (i tipped 8 bucks but service didn't feel like 8 bucks tho  they just stood around doing nothing) overall i gave 3 stars because it's just mediocre  nothing really wowing or extraordinary  cost is kinda over the top considering the type of food you find in flushing 
got n2 (non spicy beef noodle with the extra wide noodles)  loved the noodle  perfectly made and cooked   chewy with a bounce! soup base is clear but very flavorful at the same time! beef is sliced and very tender  simple bowl of noodle with a huge flavor and texture  very generous with the noodle portions!! big fan! will def come back!
my go to for a quick bowl of noodles near flushing! the place is never crowded even on a weekend night and the food arrives quickly  really good portion sizes  and the noodles and broth are up to par with other hand pulled places  service is alright  decor is clean  not many places these days with  food less than $8 so check it out!
this place has quick service and noodles were delicious! noodles were a pretty good portion  the restaurant was clean and have strong ac  which is also for a hot summer day  ordered the n1 and it came out so fast! the food came out in less than 10 mins  if you are ever on a time crunch you should definitely come here  one thing i really didn't like is one of the staff  asked her for the bill but she looks at me and my friend oddly like we were asking her for something else  not sure if it's because she did not understand english or if she could not hear me  either way she ignored me  and gave someone else their bill  instead of ignoring me i think she should have asked me to repeat myself if she did not understand  the staff is the only reason why i am rating this place 4 stars  recommended if you can speak mandarin 
love my bowl of beef lanzhou noodle soup but where's the beef?the stew pork buns were also good but a bit pricey (including the combination choices) we like the restaurant because it's quiet and service was good   but hoping they'll be more generous with the slices of beef in their noodle soups 
nevermind  this feels like pre made added water beef noodles  very disappointed considering high rating and in the center of flushing where all chinese food are high standards  we ordered the noodles and they were ready to serve in a minute  and they tasted horrible  we were the only one in  ruined my craving for lanzhou noodles  i was following all that good reviews to come here  so not true  when we said it's less than a minute  it wasn't steamy hot! and we know how handmade noodles are 
ordered the n1 combo which comes with the classic lanzhou beef noodle soup  egg  pickled cabbage in hot chili oil  and a can of soda  i didn't care for the cabbage on its own but it was surprisingly good with the noodles  the broth was very tasty and mildly spicy  the bowl doesn't come with much meat but it was enough for me as i am not a huge meat eater anyways  definitely would come again for the same item or even something new the waitress spoke enough english to understand our order and the restaurant accepts credit card (visa at least)  they did ask that we tip using cash 
i've been going here ever since they first opened  hands down the best lanzhou lamian place in flushing  they've updated their menu a few times  i do miss their crispy lamb  soup broth is always phenomenal and the serving size of the noodles is such a good deal! noodles are made fresh and the lamb burgers are way better than the ones from xi'an's famous food  get the thin noodles they soak up the broth better 
great spot on a cold day  i only had the braised beef noodle soup  but it was so full of flavor  the texture of the noodles is perfect  nothing about it was wrong except they could maybe add a bit more of everything  beef  bakchoy  and noodles  coming back to try more things
incredible prices  delicious noodles  but the portions are not large enough  i had the house beef noodle soup  the hand pulled noodles were just the right amount of chewy and the soup was flavorful  it's a clear broth soup  and not a milky bone broth the eggplant side was just so so  but it was necessary because our noodles were not enough to satiate!
nice noodles and appreciates   the service is good and fast   if you want to try the traditional lan zhou noodles   you have to try the noodles here   like the chopsticks and teapot   the waitress are professional   she gave me some suggestion on the noodle   this place is awesome  unique    new and hot  
awesome ramen and big flavor broth  but the lamb dish we ordered was very bland  it's steam and served with some dry spicy on the side and cost $27 99 for 5 pieces  we will come back only for the ramen 
i'm from lanzhou and i seriously grew up eating the noodles  the waitress (i would assume not a lanzhou native) told me there is only one type of noodles available while i know it's not true  you can always ask for wider  thinner  thicker or slimmer shapes of your noodles i asked her to tell the chef what i've told her and it came out great!!that is  the chefs are definitely my hometown people  certified by a lanzhou girl  there  ) good job making the authentic noodles and spreading the warmth 
love the food there!!! spicy cumin lamb burger is amazing!!!
decent hand pulled noodlesthe hand pulled noodles are made to order  on the upside  the space is well lit and seems clean  i came here two times because i wasn't sure if i liked it or not  on the plus side  you don't feel overwhelmed after a bowl of noodles here  the beef is tender and not rubbery like some of the stalls in the flushing mall food court  it's really cool how the expert noodle maker chef smashes the dough on the stainless steel flat surface in the kitchen sadly  i feel like is nothing really special about the noodles  the noodles are decent but not spectacular enough to spark cravings  personally  i rather have a chinese korean bowl of noodles 
if you want to try authentic traditional chinese food   it is the best choice  pork burger is my most favorite  the boss here is so nice!
this restaurant provides very authentic lanzhou hand made noodle  my husband is from lanzhou and he thinks dunhuang's beef noodle soup is as good as what he had at his hometown  we also met the chef  who is a native lanzhou er  i guess that's their secret recipe for all these delicious food  the environment and the decoration is very modern and clean  the staffs are all young people  very nice and friendly  i would recommend this restaurant to everyone who loves ramen!
taste is particularly good  beef noodles beef too little， attendant service is not thoughtful  serving particularly slow  do not understand customer needs  in short  the service is not satisfied with the need to improve 
i had n3 on the menu which was the spicy braised noodle soup with their regular noodles  it was good  but not amazing  some reviews said they had a clear glass kitchen but they covered it up now so who knows what goes on back there now? i certainly didn't hear anyone banging noodles  the cold appetizer with the n5 combo was just pickled cabbage in spicy oil (not spicy)  it was meh  overall  the noodles were nice and chewy  broth pretty good  but not one of the out of this world beef broths i've had  it's good to eat it fresh  my leftovers got soggy quickly when i ate it at home without reheating  it's worth trying to see if you like it  but i think i rather just get a cheaper fix in one of the food courts 
2nd time around and just as good    very clean  very authentic    the lamb is amazing  that's what keeps me coming back   i find it a bit on the heavy side (carbs) so enjoy coming here once a month 
hang out with my friends on sunday night  this place is well organized and clean  we order two appetizers shredded  potato and eggplant  potato is just okay  eggplant sweet and sour garlic sauce taste really good each of us order one noodle dish  radish in lamb paomo is hard to bite  should cook a little longer  beef noodle and lu noodle are bland  the home made spicy sauce is no good  the beef sandwich has no cilantro 
this is my third time at this place  i love noodles and when i heard of this place i immediately came to try  service was great! waiters were attentive and came by often to refill tea  the place isn't the biggest place but it could still fit a decent amount of people  lunch times this place is pretty much packed (no wait time though)  since there's only two main dishes (lamb beef noodle) you pretty much know what you'll be eating when you go  they have a few assortment of cold dishes and to be honest the flavors were all pretty good and i have tried them all  i love spicy foods and their spice did not disappoint  a little bit of hot with a little bit of numbness  try it!
delicious classic beef hand pulled noodle  order the set with pickled egg  boiled egg  and soda  a must try meal 
popular hole in the wall place (but relatively clean)  high and fast customer turnover  delicious beef noodle soup  great cilantro beef dish  everything was very tasty  authentic and cheap   also had a lamb bun  which tasted dry  and would not get that again  saw many people order the braised sheep dish  it was a very big dish  family sized   location's a bit inconvenient  but worth the extra trek from the 7 train 
best lanzhou noodle i can find in new york  the original hand pulled noodle and niangpi are both excellent  cumin lamb burger is good too but probably not much different from what you can get at xi'an famous food  will be back next time to try other items on the menu 
really good food  authentic chinese food  very good prices  i recommend 
holy crap   the best lamb i ever had on a noodle soup base!! reminds me of pho in some way w their own kind of twist  but the lamb slices were so soft and melts  in my mouth   maybe i got lucky   or that's the way they make it! i'll come back and try again  the dish is called mutton noodle  i also tried their nangpi which was pretty good and lastly had an eggplant appetizer which was very good esp for price   ($3)new spot and getting busy so check it!
it is a strong 4 stars  the original beef noodle soup with a smattering of spice  sliced beef  radish  cilantro and hand pulled noodles is a perfectly balanced bowl of noodles  the broth has a rich but clean delicious flavor  something that has been sorely lacking in every other hand pulled noodles i have tried  the soup is always flavorless  and the flavor it has tastes more like something made from a soup base  but here it has a great flavor  also the noodles often have a great toothsome quality  frankly  before eating here i never saw the fuss over eating hand pulled soup noodles  as opposed to watching them made which was always amazing  also  the cold noodles are very good  the entree dish  not the small plate which is also pretty good  but not as good the hand pulled entree version  the cold potatoes are another favorite of mine  very simple  but tasty  the other cold dishes are very garlicky  but people seem to really like them  the spicy "potato chips" was also quite good  the noodles with minced pork sauce also tasty  the dry one  the soup with minced pork is the one noodle i had there that i really was not a fan of  it was vegetal and had a muddy flavor  seriously though if you want really good hand pulled noodles this is the place 
great for a bowl of beef noodle soup  i think the appetizers are just okay   if you come  stick with the noodles  they used to have a ribs appetizer that i liked  but it has been taken off the menu  service is very slow and kind of all over the place  i asked for water for the table  and only got one cup  even though there were three of us 
really gold hand pulled noodles! i tried the traditional beef ones and it was really good  the sauce was a bit spicy than my liking but it went well for the taste 
ordered the spicy braised beef noodle with regular noodles as well as the minced meat zha jiang with wide noodles  beef   4 5 5soup   3 5 5noodles 2 5 noodles were soft  soggy and not chewy  everything else was good though 
what a little gem we had some noodle soups that were very tasty  but their cumin braised lamb oh my god  heavenly  it is a bit on the pricey side at almost $30 but it is a large portion that can easily feed 2 
this is such a great place for family time and friend time! the restaurant is clean and decent  staff are nice and kind  they give you great advice  they offer authentic food from my home town  i strongly recommend everyone，literally everyone to try the food  especially beef noodles  if you like chinese food  please come! if you are from my hometown or areas nearby  you will be surprised by how authentic the food is  this is a restaurant for both homesick guys and gals as well as people who want to try something new and special 
i'm not sure if i was just starving from getting off a plane or the food was really good  either way  this place deserves 5 stars just because the lamb chops was cooked a very unique way and it was flavorful  the soup base was complete and didn't miss a beat 
small corner restaurant serving fantastic hand pulled noodles  fresh ingredients in tasty dishes  i had the cucumbers with spicy garlic sauce and shredded potato salad for appetizers  i then followed it with regular noodles in a vegetable sauce bowl  great food in a clean environment 
the food here is definitely traditional lanzhou style  for chinese yummy  chinese yummy  here is the best one you should come over 
today finally   l found my most favorited lanzhou noodle soup  i order chicken cold salad and classic lanzhou beef nooodle it's really taste awesome no words  after 15 year's later  i founded real lanzhou traditional food i try many many nooodle soup  in different  kind of chinese restaurants  but i suggestion this is  a  best palace in new york for noodle lover  definitely i will bring my wife hear next   she will  love it  thank you   dunhuang lanzhou  restaurant  food is real real awesome  and taste super duper!! thank you see next time
this is my go to noodle place in flushing  i always order the original but non spicy bowl and its consistently delicious!!! comes with a slightly spicy (very slightly) clear soup and some beef and radish  high recommended!!
delicious hand pulled noodles   scrumptious broth   we had the traditional and the vegetarian   super nice wait staff  clean tables   we will be back soon 
this place has the best chinese style noodles i've had since i lived in beijing  and that is saying something! also  the value (quality price) of this place is unbelievable  amazing food for very affordable prices  the interior of the restaurant is also attractive with nice wall paintings and attractive furniture  totally appropriate for a date or for dinner with friends  the customer service i've experienced is also nice with attentive waiters with a short wait between ordering and the arrival of food  overall  i strongly recommend this restaurant!
if you're feeling a hot  sometimes spicy  soup noodle then this is a good option to consider   the place is modern and bright with ample room for small groups   i had the braised beef noodles   the flavor of the soup is a well seasoned but i found it hard to distinguish the type of base it was made from   portions are good sized but if you need more they have additions like extra noodles  eggs  or vegetables that you can add to your bowl  at a cost of course 
i went back because i really liked their soup  i ordered the classic spicy instead regular with an egg  they gave me more beef slices this time  the waiters are still slow but my noodles came out quicker this time 
food? excellent  price not so much  im used to paying $6 50 at the new mall next to macys for the same thing  here  not only is it more but u have to tip  so after the bill comes out u pay $10  it will be  ice to have family dinner or luncheon but as a craving satisfying bowl  id def go to the mall 
omg!!!  i am a huge fan of beef noodles and cold skin noodles and i almost tried every beef noodles in the city!!  by far this is the most authentic flavor   next month when my family comes i'll bring them there ==love transparent kitchen and clean environment    definitely coming back soon~~
chewy  hand pulled noodles  aromatic and flavorful broth  and juicy tender beef on top of a polite staff  clean restaurant  and free tea! this may be the best noodle soup i've had for 7 dollars!
ordered the lamb noodles   noodles were on point  the broth was very flavorful the cucumbers and spicy garlic sauce was ight def going to try the other noodles next time 
i had the spicy braised noodle soup and it was delicious!  just the right amount of heat without it being overbearing   portions were okay  a lot more noodles than stuff to go with it   overall  the meal was affordable   took a star off because of lackluster service   our waiter didn't speak any english and when we asked for 2 cups of tea and 2 cups of water we got 1 cup of hot water and a cold cup of tea   
awesome food  need hire more server waitress worked really hard and the guy was obviously new  will consider back again because the food 
i was skeptical of the 4 5 stars but my parents wanted to try this place out anyway  i'm sure you can see my by 3 stars  that the 4 5 is too good to be true on saturday at 12 30 (prime lunch time)  it wasn't very busy  we ordered the potato salad  beef noodle soup  lamb noodle soup  and "zha jiang" noodles  the potato salad was okay   didn't have any strong taste  the noodles are decent  however  the soup for both bowls were not only luke warm  not hot as it's supposed to be  but also kind of bland  the sauce for the zha jiang noodles again was too mild  nothing really stood out about this place  the lan zhou noodles at new world mall definitely beats this place by a lot service is overall decent  i guess  however  the waitress didn't speak english; thought that was a bit odd   she didn't understand me when i was ordering thick noodles 
i've tried lanzhou beef noodle in so many places before but neither of them are from lanzhou china  my friend recommended this new place and i decided to give a try  i ordered beef soup noodle and lamp  chops  after my first bite i almost scream out! this is it! i finally find it!
one star taken off for the service  we waited just a few minutes too long to be acknowledged  i think they were short staffed so not their fault  but once someone approached us  it was smooth sailing and entrees came out very quickly  fried lamb chops were amazing  along with the dry spices that came on the side  i had to ask to take some of the cumin run home bc it was so delicious  also ordered the fungus mushroom in vinegar sauce  it was really good for a quick appetizer but def put some more vinegar on (on the table)  we both ordered the prime beef house soup with regular noodles  so good  they ran out of the lamb that could be added on the soup  but it was alright  so refreshing  the boyfriend added chili sauce to make his spicier but i loved the refreshing taste of mine sans the spicy kick  very worth it for a quick dinner!
the best chinese noodles restaurant!!! love it the lanzhou beef noodles soooooo much! the service is excellent! they are really friendly!!! fully recommend all to come here!!! you will never regret!!!
this little spot has perfect beef noodle soup just like the one in china  after i have eaten cheap fake lan zhou beef noodle for years  i finally found this place which have authentic beef noodle  even my parents who were a little picky about chinese food also like this place  the price is little higher than other beef noodle soup place but still reasonable  i am so happy they accept credit card since usually i won't carry cash  the location is not very convenience but that's ok
everything are delicious  the lanzhou noodle is the best  must try !!!!! the owner is so nice and friendly  have a great time there 
this is the rare chinese restaurant that has the whole package  delicious food  clean  and well decorated  i've only had the classic beef noodle and it was tasty with hearty flavors and fresh noodles (good chew)  i really like their attention to detail in the utensils  long  elegant chopsticks and soup noodle spoons that don't get lost in the large bowl  i almost never see this kind of care taken in chinese places  and it leaves a great impression of the restaurant and the food as a whole 
the noodle with sweet & spicy sauce is the best!! the soup base is very flavorful and the beef i added in the noodles was very tender  the niangpi is good too if you like cold noodles with peanut sauce  i am definitely coming back!
delicious noodle soups  healthy  and inexpensive  also  this is one of the few restaurants from this northern chinese province  the soups are a bit similar to the vietnamese pho  they have lamb dishes  the everthing tastes freshly made 
i love the noodles here  i am so hooked on it that i can't help to keep coming back every weekend even though it take me 45 min to get there!
excellent and authentic  i was in lanzhou last summer and this place is for "real"  both noodle and broth are just right  i finished my bowl to the last drop 
probably the only authentic lanzhou noodle place in the whole new york city  chewy noodle  clear broth yet rich in flavor  add some chili oil and vinegar  you will not regret coming to this place  forget about golden mall  new world mall or any other place that acclaim they have authentic lanzhou style noodle  because this is the place to beat  and this is the only place truly resemble noodle you can have in lanzhou  china 
love the chewy noodles & beef noodle broth  didn't really like the cold eggplant appetizer but the fungus w  vinegar one was good  the lamb burgers were great tho  had the right amount of spice  service is alright 
the spicy lamb burger hits the spot   the right amount of spice and not greasy  would only recommend putting in more filling  doesn't seem to be enough for the size of the bun 
the noodles are great! very good flavor  one of the best chinese noodle places in flushing  we will definitely come back again  the environment is comfortable and their customer service is awesome!
if you are looking for a good meal at a low price look no further  my boyfriend and i both ordered the braised beef soup and it was delicious!!!
definitely the most solid lam zhou noodle place in flushing    get the cumin lamb burger (less greasy than xi an famous foods)  the zha jiang noodles  and the beef noodle soups  (also all the meaty lamb dishes are solid too!)
awesome amazing noodle bowl  i got the duck with beef broth  so good  big portion too and the noodles are chewy and hit the spot  the chili oil is a must with a few splashes of vinegar too  really good cheap food 
i ordered beef noodle soup and my husband had the spicy beef noodle soup   both tasted good! the soup was delicious and the noodle was tasting good too unlike some places soup taste good but noodle tasteless  we also ordered cucumber and fries with spicy sauce both were good too  place was clean  noodle came fast  will come again!
really love their eggplant salad! it really helps to comfort my homesick  beef noodle soup are not bad or i should say their hand pulled noodle soup are very authentic  not like over 90% so called lanzhou hand pulled noodle soup in american market are actually made by fujianese people  
this restaurant has great atmosphere  i would describe it as clean  comfortable and welcoming  the food are authentic based on my experience eating in lanzhou city  my favorite dishes are lanzhou hand pulled noodle  spicy cumin lamb burger and lamb chop  in addition  the waiters and waitresses are friendly and pleasant to speak to 
i will preface this review by making it clear that i am not a noodle fanatic  my wife and i went there after reading a few reviews by fellow yelpers  the restaurant is definitely clean and well laid out  it was very thoughtful to have the kitchen open to see the chefs making the noodles by hand  we ordered the beef noodles  cumin lamb burger  and eggplant side  the food was good  however could have used more flavor in my humble opinion  the establishment was fairly empty while we were eating and it took quite sometime before our tea was refilled  i think that this restaurant has a bright future if they can place more focus on customer service and highlight more about what makes their food unique 
very nice restaurant  appetizers also tasty  only one thing not feel really good is they accept card over $20  i decide to go again this week  p
just went lanzhou beef noodle for lunch  we tried so many different things  thanks to the huge party size   we loved almost everything  especially the eggplant salad  bitter gourd (it might be a personal thing)  liangpi (凉皮   there are two kinds and they are both good)   those appetizers are insanely cheap and yummy  for warm dishes  my fav include the egg rolls with pork inside  as well as the sweet and sour pork  my friends are a big fan of the lamb chops  both fried and steam versions  give this new restaurant a try 
freshly made hand drawn noodles  compliments sliced beef with daikon radish in a clear clean tasting broth wonderfully  the menu items are limited  however don't deter you from trying this place  ordered spicy cold noodles which was not saturated with sauce yet supplied an ample of taste for satisfaction  the eggplant salad which was marinated with garlic and a soy sauce base was delicious as well 
just went there a few days ago and already craving!! didn't really pay attention to the service  but the food was so goood  it was worth it for the price  which is really inexpensive  but the beef noodle taste a lot like vietnamese pho just missing a stronger broth flavor  their cold noodle appetizer was delicious and was my favorite  very inexpensive great place to try  would come back if it was a little closer but worth the distance for someone who can make time for it 
i am from lanzhou   really recommend this restaurant  so delicious and it's almost same! love this place and will come back again
great hand pulled lamb and other lanzhou dishes! i visited this today and had the chance to order different lambs  cold rice noodle  it's great 
excellent fresh noodles and delicious broth that's not too oily  such a pleasant surprise with how good it was 
there are hundreds of japanese ramen places in new york city and many are highly regarded   the original ramen from china seemed to have become a lost art  well  after i had tried tens of chinese ramen places  until today  a straight 5 stars of quality  flavor  and perfection that woke up my long lost memory of the taste from a grand master noodle place (said to be the most authentic from hundreds years ago) that i had about 20 years ago  that's the impression after taking the first bite   as i licked the spoon after the last drop of soup  i thought  the taste matches  yet  the perfection and quality top the best of what i had  and i fortunately had the chance to try the best chinese ramen in many cities in asia  the environment is very clean with open kitchen separated by glass (you can see the chef smiling back at you)  staffs are friendly and professional  parking in the nearby municipal lot is convenient highly recommend this place 
authentic hand crafted noodle  with traditional original beef soup!!! remind me of what i had back in lanzhou! love the slowly stewed lamb! burger with spicy lamb is also very impressive  i'd say this is the place to go for authentic northwestern style chinese cuisine  so far the best in ny  hygienic environment  and extremely friendly staff  wonderful experience! no doubt will bring in more friends and family here!
the menu is small but they're supposedly known for the hand pulled noodles   i didn't know until after  so i had ordered something else   you would only have to wait about 5 10 min before your food arrives   quick but i wish i had more attention at the end when i wanted to ask for the check 
this is a great spot with yummy noodles and small dishes that are unique to the northwest of china  the interior and bathrooms are very clean  you can see the whole kitchen operation through the glass  i loved the classic noodle soup and lamb chops  as well as the small dishes like eggplant  i can't wait for this place to expand to manhattan so i can go more often!
i'm a huge fan of authentic lanzhou beef noodle  and i've been looking for it every time i go to nyc  to my disappointment   none of the other lanzhou noodle shops in the area are even close to being authentic  this restaurant saves the day by presenting the same lanzhou noodles that i've had in china  as soon as the noodles are presented in front of us  i could feel that this is it  the noodles  the soup  the radish  the greens  everything is textbook lanzhou style  if you love the real lanzhou noodles from china  look no further  because this restaurant finally got it right 
the noodle is very chewy  must try! the cold noodle is hella delicious!but their appetizer  buns and burgers aren't that good 
this was my first time trying this type of cuisine and i was pretty excited! i've had sichuan food before (i've been to chengdu) and i'm definitely a spice numbing queen  we came here for a birthday dinner and we were seated at one of the best tables of the house (by the windows on the second floor)  the staff was so friendly and accommodating when they knew it was for a birthday dinner! the menu was a bit hard to understand (if you don't speak or understand chinese) since the english descriptions are very limited  however  i was with very knowledgeable chinese folks so make sure you befriend one before coming here! we decided on getting two hot pot dishes  one was a numbing spice frog dish and the other one was a sour fish dish  i personally liked the numbing frog dish but everyone else seemed to like the fish one better  we also got the mango juice tower complimentary of ordering $100+ worth of food  this place also gives you a plastic bag so you can store your jackets without the smell of the place!
love the place for its new fusion of modern chinese food  i had the seafood pot  is crab shack pot boil but with chinese spices and flavors  you can request mild upon request  i did notice a dish with bull frog  to my appetite for new and bold i had the frog leg as a side  you have sides of grilled corn  grilled buns!!! chicken wings   grilled squid  and the frog among others  their main dishes are for two people  giving single person or a solo adventurer having to pay for two  is why i give it 4 stars instead of 5  i almost gave it a three  they should expand their menu for solo flyers  on the other hand i was given a huge pitcher of sparkling water with passion fruit  it's given for free if one volunteers for a review on yelp  which i happily implied and was rewarded with is freshness  it was refreshing due to some of their plates being spicy  to end i was given a black tea with jelly  is a first for me  almost like cinnamon tea at some korean restaurants or green tea at other places  complimentary  the waiter was friendly in explaining the dishes and the experience 
great authentic addition to the main flushing area  awesome service and free soda if you scan the qr code on wechat  we had lunch on a saturday (they open at 12) which meant that we avoided the evening crowds  we ordered the original house spicy tofu flavor with the $55 fish option (some kind of bass  which had very little bones)  you can do any combination of 4 side items for $8  we went with chinese veggies  green bean vermicelli  seaweed  and lotus root  they gave generous portions buried in the hot sauce  you can add an side order at the end  which we did with the veggies they help you shift the burners on the bottom but parts of the hot sauce does get congealed  it also gets very spicy the longer it cooks  so if you're not used to sichuan spicy  opt for the mild options  will definitely come back and try other flavors of fish also tried the bbq squid  which had too much of the cumin flavor and was too chewy 
hot space grilled fish! a hot displacement of sentosa  which used to occupy this address  hot space is a good spot for a small group to share a meal  the concept  giant chafing trays of szechuan style "stews " brought to a simmer right at your table  each dish feeds 3 4 people and runs $50 60  you choose the protein  the flavor sauce  and the add ons  proteins are mostly fish  but there was at least one vegetarian friendly option  each flavor sauce has spiciness level indicated  $2 50 for each add on (tofu  greens  mushrooms  etc )  or choose any 4 for $8  $1 per bowl of rice  mark your selections on the menu yourself  we chose a) barramundi (their softest fish and the one with the least pinbones)  b) in "spicy hot grilled fish tofu pudding" flavor  which just means silken tofu is included c) with add ons  asparagus lettuce  woodear mushroom  konnyaku  and napa cabbage the "spicy hot grilled fish tofu pudding" is designated their spiciest flavor  with 2 little chili icons  but our server ranked it 5 6 on a scale of 1 10  that was spot on  it really was not spicy  in either the 麻 (numbing spice) or the 辣 (capsaicin spice) department service was attentive  with 3 servers separately asking us how things were  explaining menu options  etc  when we asked them to leave the chafing fuel lit so our food stayed hot  they explained that they didn't want the fish to overcook  but still entertained our preferences  one server took us through the rigmarole of choosing our "free" fruit juice  served in a beer tower  only when he asked for our wechat did we realize this was a promotion they were doing for wechat users only  i'm not a 20 year old chinese person  so no wechat and no mango juice for us  is the food tastier here than other szechuan restaurants (most of which serve pots of fish cooked in fiery chili broth)? no    but it does look cooler on a giant tray taking up all the table space  and the fish is generous and fresher than the boneless skinless slabs you get at many szechuan spots  they did not oversalt  either  which is hard to find  three cheers for hot space!
five star food and five star service all the way! our favorite restaurant for spicy crabs and stir fried cauliflower  we're addicted (literally) !!!
do not come here to eat  once you tried you'll be hooked to their additive hot space sauce and now i have to go there to eat every 3 4 days  not a healthy choice but the food is delicious
located right in the center of the flushing bid (business improvement district)  hot space grilled fish is one of the newest addition of asian cuisine into the area  without further ado  let's get right into business restaurant  great vibe  two floors of dining space  we sat at the second floor and the space has a large tv covering the entire wall playing various music videos (chinese and english mainly)  i was actually informed by a staff that we can add songs to the mix as there was a computer screen next to the restroom similar to ones you find in ktv  lighting was sufficient and table spacing did not seem to be an issue staff  very attentive  to start off  they offer a giant plastic bag to put our jackets in so that the smell of the food does not seem into our clothes  definitely a great gesture that other restaurants with heavy smells can learn from! our waitress ran us through the menu as it was our first time dining at the restaurant  throughout the entirety of the meal  we've had various staff members refill our waters  stop by to ask about our food  as well as refill our fish's broth level food  the main attraction here is obviously the fish  they have three different fish options  carp  bass  and barramundi with the first being around four pounds and the latter being two  they have premise options for you to order from which has sauces and vegetable pairings made for you  alternatively  you can choose your fish  among eight different sauces  and loads of veggies  there are also various appetizers and skewers to order from as well  what we got  for four people  we ordered a chilled tofu preserves egg appetizer which came in a soy sesame sauce that was quite refreshing  we also got a grilled eggplant that was smoky and tender  for the main course  we ordered the carp in a mild garlic sauce with four rices on the side  there was also a free sparking water tower for helping promote their business via wechat (our waitress helped us do it)  the meal ended with some free herbal jelly to cool down the palette  damage  after tax and tip  the four of us paid $23 50 each  not bad for a dinner out in the city  will recommend return!
an unbelievable experience  excellent food  attentive and friendly service  and very cool  welcoming  modern atmosphere  can not recommend enough  will definitely be back  worth the trip from manhattan 
very good service! the staff is beyond friendly! seriously must try there grilled oysters!! i love it so much i order six of them lolololol!
hi everybody  this is my first review ever  this restaurant isn't particular special  but it is simply the place i ate at last and freshest in my memory  i will actually be going back and reviewing other places i've eaten at over the years  now without further ado   to be frank  i was dragged here by a foodie friend of mine  i didn't even know this place existed  my friend is a huge fan of hot and spicy sichuan food  and so she said that this place is actually the second location of this other wildly successful place in brooklyn  so when she heard that this place has opened up in flushing (near where she lived) she just had to drag all of us there  there were 5 of us and we were seated quickly on a thursday night  there are about 8 10 tables in the place  with a giant full screen tv in the background playing chinese mvs  i thought the volume of the ambiance was just right; quiet enough that you can have a conversation  but loud enough that added a certain liveliness  we were on the first floor  but there is a set of stairs going upstairs and i saw the hostess leading customers upstairs  i wasn't curious enough to go check it out  but i assume it's the same layout  we ordered chinese style  we got their signature spicy hot grilled (misspelled i assume) fish tofu pudding (yes  that is a weird name) and the hot spicy crawfish's (this place needs to get their spelling together)  we added a bunch of vegetables into each of them (they recommend at most 3 vegetables per dish ) we also ordered a bunch of sides like the roasted frog  the grilled chicken wings  eggplant  and corn the fish was delicious  okay  i'm not saying it's the best fish i've ever had (because that's going to come in a different review ) but it was pretty darn good  i went in without much expectation  but i was pretty blown away by the spices in the fish dish  i could not stop eating it  keep in mind that i'm currently dieting and i'm not suppose to be eating too much carbs  but that meal  i ate two bowls of rice (the spiciness also had something to do with that)  the spices in the dish have completely soaked through the vegetables and potato we put into it  but not quite the fish  i am never afraid of double dipping into the sauce after i break down the pieces of fish so it was all the same to me  i can go on about the fish  but i'll stop myself here  let's just say it was pretty damn good i am not a huge fan of crawfish  but my friends were and they couldn't stop raving about the crawfish  i had one  the flavors were good and the size stood out to be bigger than i've had it elsewhere  i let my friends enjoy the rest of the crawfish and focused on the fish dish since it was a grilled fish shop  the sides were overall pretty good  though i feel like they could have used a little less garlic on the eggplant  but other than that  no complaints  the service overall was very good  they are very well staffed  and the staff seems well trained; they came over every once in a while to help us "unstick" the bottom of the pot and waters were refilled promptly  i also felt they were very knowledgeable about the menu and what seems to be the owner actually came over and asked us how our experience was  we said it was great  he recommended us to try the bullfrog the next time we go  overall  for the 5 of us  we spent $40 per person after tip and tax  i felt that was really good for the price  definitely a lot better than good harvest just next door  which costs more  okay  i felt like i've rambled on for an eternity  i apologize for the wordiness of the post  i think it's just because it's my first post ever  i've also attached a picture of the menu because i knew i was writing this and didn't want to get the dishes names wrong  thanks for reading!tldr; great fish place  go try it  you won't regret it 
hotspace opens in flushing with a nice interior   similar to its brooklyn store  this one has two floors and cute fixtures  waitstaff was very attentive and friendly  prices are a bit on the high side for the area  the fish we got was the spicy garlic sauce  pick 2 vegetables for $8  post a check in on wechat get a free pitcher of soda juice  we also got the mouth watering chicken which was not spicy at all let alone mouthwatering but the texture was nice  it just felt like they dumped a bunch of spicy oil on top of the cold braised chicken  roasted pig foot or bbq pig foot which was well executed  and a side of stir fried spicy cabbage  the cabbage was a bit tasteless   again doused in spicy oil but not spicy and the portion was huge  half a cabbage head in there huge  the fish was mediocre  they don't have vents in there so the smell of the oil does stick to you   when we walked in they put our coats into clear plastic bags so our coats wouldn't smell so that's a nice touch  the veggies in the fish were ok but everything felt doused in oil  if you want spicy fish try a sichuan restaurant  maybe we ordered the wrong things but i might give the place another try
so hot space is a restaurant that i really recommend  they are a new hot pot spot  the decor is awesome with a huge karaoke tv! remind me of shanghai ! food was excellent very spice  you should order sea bass it was very spicy! i really recommend this place to everybody as i love it
food  5 5  the grilled fish was as good as it gets  and the staff kept it hot the whole time we ate (1 5 hours) service  4 5  we were initially annoyed by how impatient one waitress was as we tried to pick between buffalo fish (4 lbs) and other lighter fishes (~2 lbs)  but it was more than compensated later on by how attentive other waitresses were  came here on a weekend to try out the grilled fish that we heard so much about  the restaurant was situated in one of the busiest streets in flushing  so i wouldn't recommend driving here  it was opened pretty recently as we can tell by the congratulatory flower pots near the entrance  the restaurant was already half full an hour after open during noontime  we went up to the second floor and were seated near the window area  since it was the first time we were here  it took us a little bit of time to understand the ordering process (select type of broth  fish  and then sides to put in with the fish)  the waitress was standing nearby despite after i told her to give us some time to decide  she was visibly annoyed and impatient  we finally decided to try out the buffalo fish  which had more bones than other fishes but also larger in size  it was definitely one of the better grilled fish places i had been to for a while  the fish was fresh  the broth was also right on point with the spiciness  and the waitress kept the broth hot the whole time we ate (it took us 1 5 hours to finish)  the waitress was very attentive as well  constantly coming over to make sure the bottom pan didn't burn the fish and check on the stove fire  definitely a pleasant lunch despite the initial hiccup  as an added bonus  if you re post the restaurant's ad on your wechat moment  they will give you a rather large flavorful sparkling water for free  it will make your meal much more enjoyable  especially if you got the spicy broth  overall  i enjoyed the meal and will definitely come back for more when i crave for grilled fish 
the best restaurant in flushing   good service!the owner also is a nice person they really take care of each customers taste is very well 
wonderful service  very attentive staff  they think of everything  from giving you a large plastic bag to keep your coats  to the grass jelly at the end of the meal  we went for the ma la spicy fish with tofu and had the baramundi  a smaller fish which was way more than enough for 2  was it spicy  yes  can you taste everything  yes  go a bit early or a bit late to miss the crowds and go with a bunch of people  it's a hoot!
i loved the flavor! customer service was quite great  they will check in to make sure the seafood is not sticking to the pot and sauce doesn't get too thick  i highly recommend this place  will go back again 
we almost skipped this place but so glad we didn't   a young lady name yao helped us step by step how to order the food here  i never experience such customer service in flushing  tina  our server  she kept on checking on us to see if we need anything or not  i love fish  and this place is worth of try  the menu might seems complicated but its okay  the staffs will help you! the food came out super fresh  they cooked the fish in the kitchen  then they serve it with a huge tray  the portion is huge! it's worth of the money 
we had the same grilled fish with mala over fire in paris (le pont de sichuan) and i kid you not   (drum roll)  it's better and more flavorful there! we came on a saturday evening and it was packed  we left our name and they gave us a buzzer to hang on to  we were told it would be about a half hour  so we headed to a bar across the street to grab a drink  true enough in half hour it buzzed and our table was ready just as we walked in  looking at the menu  there's a bunch of spicy dishes  we ordered the 夫妻肺片which is a beef tendon and offal sliced real thin dosed in chili oil  wasn't super impressed because it wasn't flavorful  all you taste is bland chili oil  the grilled oyster which did not come in a shell ahem  was also average  for some reason when i eat oysters  i just want to see the shell! this was also on the bland side with some soy sauce and vermicelli  the fish that came in a rectangular pan and heated on a flame was big in size but also doused in chili oil  nothing wrong with that if it's flavorful  this was also on the bland side  service was friendly though  i'll definitely give them that! would i come back? hmmmm  that's a 50 50  
omg!  this place is so good! there are tons of flavors in their fish dish  i have to compliment their customer service too   all the servers are very attentive and very friendly  i came here twice and left very satisfied   will come back again   i'm just addicted to their fish dish 
we wanted to try something new and this was new for sure  many ways of ordering the type of fish you want with vegetables at extra cost  the fish that we have ordered was actually cooked perfectly and the soup we picked was the spicy oil & sour soup  we honestly thought it was just ok  service was great and attentive 
you must try this place  i was about to skip this place  i'm so glad that i didn't  the staff here is incredibly nice  they pay attention to all the guests throughout the whole time you're there  a young lady who works there explain to us how the menu works  it's confusing at first but try it!!    the food was really good  i got the spicy fish and be careful with the spice  it gets a lot to handle but worth the burn  the mango iced tea was very nice as well  i would recommend trying one of their teas  it'll help if your mouth is burning  the food here is fresh  it comes out on a hot plate with fire burning underneath  the atmosphere here is nice too  a bunch of lights  a big tv playing popular music videos  overall this place was an awesome experience and worth it  the grass jelly at the end blew me away  i mean honestly if some place is offering you grass in jelly form  that place is worth a try  )
i saw this place on yelp and it didn't disappoint us at all  me and my boyfriend were skeptikal because of the good reviews and we decided to just try it out and i'm so glad we did  we ordered a big mouth sea bass with mild spicy garlic sauce and veggies in it  i looooved the noodles! it was my first time eating that kind of noodles and it went really great with the fish which was surprising  i also ordered a mango iced tea which was i think is not that good  but it's alright  other than that  great experience and great customer service  the waitress really helped us throughout the menu  will definitely be back to try something else
how can i explain   yao was great  the food was so good and whatever was recommended by yao turned out food for the soul  it was my first time here and it was great  i will definitely come here again and recommend this place to everyone who loves fish 
my girlfriend and i came for the fish because one of her girlfriend told her about it and said it was very good  i was skeptical  my skepticism was reduced as i was waiting to be seated and as people were leaving i heard them thank the wait staff  to me that's usually a good sign  the fish did not disappoint  the waitress we had recommended the bass which she said had the smallest amount of fish bones  and i was all for that  the food and service were both pretty good  my girlfriend was happy so i was happy  we live around the area so we'll probably be back
this is a new hot pot fish spot that opened up recently in flushing  there's another fish spot in flushing  this spot is spicier than the other one  so if you like spicy food like me  then this is the place for you  price is good for the quality of the food 
their grilled fish is delicious!! the environment is nice and clean  i'm glad gave it a try  you won't regret it 
ordered the signature spicy tofu grilled fish with some add on side dishes  fish is fresh but the skin is not crispy as i thought i would be  the sauce is not very flavorful  if you check in or share on wechat they offer a slice of matcha crepe from prince tea house (too bad didn't have my phone with me the day i went) 
such a great spacious and modern place to enjoy authentic szechuan food  all dishes are hot  numbing  spicy  flavorful    cravings resolved!it is really far from the city but it's worth the 50 minute train ride on the 7 line for me because i'm a szechuan food junkie  i had the spicy beef tribe  a fish dish ( forgot whats it called)  and stewed fatty beef with inoki mushroom  everything was so tasty and the side dish they offered was so good  wish they refilled it for free but it turns out you have to pay if you want more 
price  above average dish  averagestay away from some of their so called szechuan dish  like fish in pickle soup  it's not szechuan dish at all  after i pointed this out  they claimed locals like it that way  plain soup  cheap fish and supermarket pickle  actually they do have some decent dish at price under $15  i suggest you try those dish so far i don't find any dish above $20 worth the money  you go to else where they have true szechuan  and not make cheap dish and claim people like it!
i gave it three stars because the food is really just aight  fish filet with pickled veggies soup  it's alright  the quantity is pretty good  but it tastes kinda plain  sauteed loofah with garlic  pretty disappointing  it doesnt taste that good either  i dont recommend this dish  even though i personally love loofah spicy chicken stew  the chicken is very tender and soft  but it's not spicy at all the wait is usually pretty crazy  so make reservation if you wanna skip the line 
the food was good but wasnt as spicy as expected service was good  the wait for the table was long and there werent enough room to wait for a table 
this place was packed when we went  my bf was the only non chinese person there  there's free hot tea over a little fire in the most luxurious cups  we ordered the pig intestines and fire pepper chicken  with salted egg corn as an appetizer  the salted egg corn was amazing  it totally stole the show  imagine tiny kernels of corn  each individually fried and then coated in salted egg  seriously i could eat that for a meal and i love meat! whattt? the other two dishes were mouth numbing  as expected for szechuan food  the crispy intestines were super juicy and the chicken was incredibly lightly fried with flavor  at the end  i asked another server for the salted corn to be boxed up to go  the other two dishes were just peppers at this point  our original server came back and said that the person who took our food to be boxed up didn't understand and instead boxed up the peppers  i laughed because i thought it was funny how someone could think that  and before i had a chance to respond he offered to take it off or cook a new one  i asked for just a small portion to be fair bc i had eaten 1 2 of it  he came back later with an entire potion for me to take home  the peppers were also in the to go container  lol  great food  great service  full of chinese people so you know it's legit 
i'd heard good things about this place from several people  so came in with high expectations  unfortunately it didn't live up to them  not even close  there's really nothing special about it  so i can't understand what the hype is about  sure  the restaurant is trendier than your standard sichuan place  but you are paying for it    prices here are substantially higher than elsewhere  ordered the beef in chilli oil dish  which was way too salty  this is a standard order of mine at sichuan places  and i can confidently say that this is among the worst that i've had  apart from the salt  i couldn't taste much else  its not very spicy either also ordered the sliced pork belly as it was mentioned several times in the reviews  that did taste fairly good (not exceptional)  but it was pretty expensive (due to the stingy portions    see pic) in summary  you are essentially paying premium prices for medicore food in a cool looking restaurant 
modern and delicious szechuan food! it was the most reasonable choice after a freezing hockey game at citi field  we took the train one stop to flushing and decided on venturing to something new  ditching the staples like nanxiang  absolutely incredible  we were seated in 20 mins because we arrive before 4pm  ordered bunch of dishes to shared among two and all of them are wonderful  the highlight would be the cabbage and the hanging bacon dish  the cabbage was very flavorful and the cold bacon dish was refreshing with the cucumber and garlic hot oil  the other are standard with good amount of spicy and numb  highly recommended! ready to try more dishes and maybe go hit up the st  marks location 
been quite into szechuan food lately so my boyfriend and i decided to give this place a try  we waited for 15 minutes for a table on a friday night  which is not bad at all  the details in this restaurant is absolutely eye catching! from the theme of the restaurant to their menu  i was amazed  for our dishes we ordered stir fried chicken with chili peppers  mapo tofu and sautéed spinach with garlic  the stir fried chicken with chili peppers was very good  the chicken was very tender and not overly fried  it's so easy to eat the small pieces of chicken that you just can't stop going for it  spiciness is manageable and goes very well with rice  it does numb your lips a bit the mapo tofu was also very good  although it wasn't very flavorful  i felt like it was just something we needed in addition to the chicken we ordered the sautéed spinach with garlic only because the sautéed string beans weren't available but it was a great veggie dish  overall  i was pretty much satisfied with the food but just a bit disappointed with the service  we had to ask two times to different waiters that we don't have cups for our tea  i was also hoping to try their complementary dessert but sadly they weren't serving it by the time we finished eating  hopefully we can try it the next time we visit ~
this is my favorite chinese restaurants not only in flushing area  but in nyc as well!!!dry fried shredded cabbage is a must try  i order this almost every time i dine in  steamed fish head with diced hot red peppers is one of my love too  very fresh fish and taste great   the closest version you can find in the us comparing to the fish dishes offered in restaurants located in china  as far as i can find  it's very unlikely you will find things you hate or get very disappointed at this place  so be open minded and order whatever you like great ambiance too  bright and oriental good service  they offer after meal special dessert too  sometimes i got green bean soup or sweet dumpling soup  at last the price is fair  $50 for two with tax and tip included  for one dish of meat fish seafood  and one dish for greens  given the good size of the portion  i think it's a good deal 
this restaurant was absolutely beautiful!!! the decor alone should be enough to entice a visit and the food itself was also very delicious and authentic   came here as a group around 5pm and already this place was filling up  the waiters were very attentive but did not rush us as we dine which felt really nice because most chinese restaurant tends to push people along to seat the next group of people  as for their dishes  it was very yummy  their fish soup with pickled vegetable is a definite must  one of the better soups i had in a very long time  perfectly spiced yet mild in flavor  their mapo tofu was also very delicious  though i did wish the pork was more pronounced  overall  my experience here was indeed delightful and their details to attention was very impressive  let's just say  i loved it so much that i can't wait to visit this restaurant again so i can try some of their other dishes!
we stopped here based on recommendations from my younger sister who attends nyu  the food was good and authentic  as in the szechuan spice was legit despite all that  i still prefer my own personal chinatown staples  i think a lot of the place is hype as there was quite a line upon walking in  we called ahead  though  so we didn't wait long i honestly don't even remember what we ordered which means the food was good but forgettable  service was good considering the full restaurant  i'm glad i tried it once and would go back but only if others wanted to go first 
to preface the meal  i was super full coming into the restaurant as this was my last meal of the day before i flew back to chicago  low expectations were coupled with my lack of appetite  i went with the standard mapo tofu  boy   it was definitely not standard by any means  the mapo tofu was maybe the best i've ever had  the spice level was perfect  tofu was cooked perfectly  i could taste the fresh herbs used in the dish  etc   the spice wasn't overwhelming either  random tidbit but their tea was really good  i will definitely be back next time to try the rest of their menu! #refereeats"i call it like i eat it "
delicious szechuan cuisine! i'm not a big fan of spicy foods but this place is actually really good  i can usually handle no more than mild spice so whatever dishes we ordered  i just avoid eating the peppers  if you don't eat the pepper then the dish is bearable   started off with sliced pork belly with chili garlic soy  love the presentation of the pork  the slices were hanging on a wooden frame like a clothesline  mapo tofu was very silky and delicious the interior is modern and beautiful 
let me start off by saying  food=5 stars and service=5 stars! i came here with my boyfriend and his 3 friends for dinner on a sunday evening around 10pm  the wait was about 15 minutes or so  not too long  the front desk lady is very well mannered and spoken to us very nicely (unlike other places where they just hush you off on the side)  service  our waiter jason helped us and recommended dishes for us to try  i must say  he and his fellow staffs offered the best service i've ever had else where  jason recommended few dishes  and he also informed us the 2 dishes we were getting are made the same way  and that we should probably try something else  i appreciate he honest opinion and not the hard push for expensive dishes  appetizer  cold chicken in hot chili oil  absolutely bomb! i've never thought a cold chicken dish would taste this good! this dish were gone minutes after it got to our table  everyone grabbed it and couldn't stop eating  its not overwhelmingly spicy  it has a good kick of spiciness to it and it's so flavorful  i would recommend this dish  diced chicken with chilis  this is my ultimate favorite dish  the chicken is diced up in small pieces  and it's soooooo juicy! i thought small pieces would be dry especially it's going to be fried then wok stir fried in chilis  but boyyyyy  was i wrong! the chicken has a numbing kind of spiciness to it  so after a few bites  your mouth and tongue will be numb  but it is so delicious  beef cooked with veggies in a pot 水煮牛肉  i personally didn't find this dish extremely delicious  but my boyfriend enjoyed it a lot  it's sliced beef boiled in hot spicy soup and it has other asian veggies in it  i forgot what the veggie is called (brain fart) but it's those tiny thinly beans  intensities with chilis  i personally don't eat anything organs (other than foie gras) so i did not touch this dish at all  but from my boyfriend's friends and him eating  i know they enjoyed it  they said it does not have those stinky intestines aftertaste so i'll take it as they did a wonderful job cleaning the intestines and eliminating the taste    choy stir fried with chilis and pork  i make this dish at home without the pork and my boyfriend loves it  he had informed me that the restaurant's dish had beat the one i made   so in that case  it's very very good  ma po tofu  it was okay  we had high hopes for this dish because you can not mess up on ma po tofu  there is just no possible way  but  this dish was just mediocre  it wasn't seasoned enough and did not have the spiciness that the dish suppose to have  overall  i will definitely come back! how can you not come back when the food is sooooooooo good and they offer exceptional service? but beware of their spiciness  it can give you a stomach if you're not used to intake that much spicy food in one meal 
my friend and i came all the way to flushing to grab some traditional szechuan spicy food  the reviews of this restaurant were good  so we had lunch here  the inner decoration was full of traditional chinese stuffs  such as iron tea port  pecking opera masks and hand writings on the wall  we had maoxuewang  which included duck blood  chicken gizzard  tripe  ham and sprouts  it was really oily and spicy  the exact way it was presented in chongqing and szechuan area  we also had corn fried with salted yolk  and rice dumpling soup flavored with homemade wine  all these were super good  and we really enjoyed this meal! highly recommended!
beautiful restaurant  great for spicy cravings  after shopping at the skyview  my family and i stopped here around 4pm and found it still crowded   a testament to how good it is  i guess  this is our third time coming here and i can tell you that each time  both the service and food have been phenomenal  my mother  born and raised in szechuan  gives a hearty two thumbs up! must tries include  szechuan fried rice  braised pork belly (hong shao rou)  and the shredded cabbage 
damnnnnnn good  the interior wins when it comes to the most inviting szechuan restaurant out there  even in flushing  i'm glad they expanded to st marks with the same design to welcome non chinese people to try them out  pork belly & cucumber slices with the chili  garlic  oil was delicious  the sauce could just be on a piping hot white rice and i could eat the whole thing  we ordered the corn kernels with duck egg yolk  which was amazing  on top of the spicy chicken wings bits and the pork belly with grapes  would definitely return next time and try their soup based dishes  they all looked delicious 
i'm not especially into the laundry drying rack i have at home  what made me think i'd be into a miniaturized version  draped with thin slices of pork belly and cucumber?you see  this is by far the the most appealing sounding app on a very concise starter list that to me  at least  is startlingly and sadly lacking in familiar standbys like dan dan noodles  spicy wontons and cucumber salad now as it turns out  presentation wise  this app looks every bit as unique as it sounds   but taste wise  i wasn't into it   sure it was a novelty at first to dip a thin  cooling strip of cucumber  together with a slice of savory pork belly into the tiny bowl of red chili oil that accompanied this dish  but after that first bite or two  i was over it   call me basic   call me what you will   but i wanted some carby classics like scallion pancakes and dumplings instead   the rest of the menu was almost as disappointing   first of all  there were an awful lot of mains priced above $20 and if memory serves  even $30   second of all  there was no cumin lamb  a favorite dish i was hoping to order   after much agonizing  i finally settled on mapo tofu  chongqing chicken  and beef with chili sauce   mapo tofu was solid  as was the lip numbing chongqing chicken  aka dry fried chicken tossed with dried chile peppers   with the latter  though  i wish the chicken hadn't been cut so small   the beef with chili sauce  which i'd ordered with my kid in mind  was served in a ton of vaguely spicy  oily broth   kid and hubby liked it well enough  but imo  it was blah   our meal came with a gratis pot of the loveliest floral jasmine green tea that was constantly refilled   service  in fact  was very attentive and friendly   the spacious  clean interior was also tres trendy    plus clearly  this spot is popular   at about 6 30 on a sunday night  it was packed   but for me  ultimately  the food just wasn't good enough to justify the significantly higher prices  (
so far my fav szechuan place in nyc  very authentic  came back so many times and never enough  must have 石锅水煮鱼  泡椒兔丁 (rabbit) in secret menu is also yummy 
i came to this restaurant upon a friend's recommendation  and honestly just wasn't that impressed  it was pretty busy  there were people in line waiting for a table  but we were fortunate enough to make a reservation  the atmosphere ambiance of the restaurant was nice  with wooden tables and private booths along the sides for larger privater parties  the service overall was pretty mediocre; although they were packed for friday night  it took a while for us to flag down the waiters and order  they also kept forgetting our orders  the appetizer with the spicy pickled cabbage was by far the best dish (and mind you  each table can only have 2 aka  one refill)  we ordered the pork intestine  chicken  and sauteed green beans  the chicken and pork intestine were both deep fried and really just lacked flavor  other than the spiciness  no other flavor was really there  and in my opinion  fried for way too long  the green beans were decent and i would highly recommend  unfortunately  rice costs money and while it does taste good  it would be appreciated if it just came with the meals  overall pricey and not worth the money unfortunately  not sure if i would come back 
wow! spicy! had a wonderful lunch here  the pork and cabbage was so tasty! stir fried frog with dried sichuan red chilies was strong and fragrant! we also enjoyed the fried eel  each dish was spicier than the next! the decor is warm  the service is attentive  the place was bustling! definitely coming back to try some of the other interesting and unusual items on the menu!
my favorite szechuan place if flushing  and nyc  with two other competitors next door and upstairs  this place is still packed during dinner time  no matter what time i come  usually need to wait 15 20 minutes the food is not super spicy or salty here but instead it emphasizes the balance between the ingredients and sauce  every dish is designed and presented in a perfect way that makes you wonder how smart the chef is  what to get  beef and tripe in chili sauce; sour beef soup; cabbage with soy sauce; steamed crab and sticky rice; eggplant and string beans; pork and cucumbers with chili sauce(you'll see almost everyone orders this) the staff are very hospitable and treat you in a respectful and friendly way  they were so thoughtful to change our plates four or five times during our dinner 
food is average but service is good here  servers will keep your table attended frequently  i was looking to order some fish here and noticed every single fish on the menu is talapia    me myself i am not a fan of talapia  but i was convinced the the waiter to order one of their best fish dishes on the menu and i did order it  it came in soup and was very sour    the cabbage i ordered was good  also ordered frog but the frog was super spicy  most of the dishes here were super spicy so get ready because i wasn't
this is a good place for people who love traditional food  the spice are good  the environment is spacious and they have great dishes 
i would give this place 10stars if i can come here for couple years after the first time try i've been addicted to this place the decoration is nice and all the staffs are friendly their cabbage is the most delicious one that i've tried in this city  also the frog dish you won't forget about it the only thing that make a headache is they always busy when dinner time you need to wait at least 30mins if you aren't lucky 
when one has just watched phil rosenthal make his way through hong kong ("i'll have what phil's having!")  and consequently developed a full on craving for ma po tofu  and laziji  and happen to be in #nyc that weekend  well  off to flushing one goes thing is  there are many  *many* restaurants in flushing  and  unlike hong kong a _lot_ of them  frankly  are the suck this  however  is not one of them the restaurant is elegant  and slightly upscale with excellent service  no odor sticking to your clothes on departure  friendly staff  good explanations  and great  *great* mapo tofu  and laziji  and  well  *everything*   just go  you'll love it   )the wine selection is lame   stick to the beer or sake 
very beautiful decors and great food   although on the pricey side compared to other szechuan restaurants but worth for the quality and service  the salty eggyork fried with corn was very yummy and plentiful! the fish with spicy oil was flavorful and the live fish fillet  wasn't overcook! the cabbage fried with pork was  good to balance out the spiciness of the fish 
i really liked the food here  we came in after having some dumplings elsewhere in flushing so weren't that hungry  but we still cleaned our plates  we got the chilli shrimp and sauteed greens  both great  they also brought out some free dessert  a sweet syrupy concoction with fruity bits in it and  of course  tea  i'd definitely come back another day to try more items  i just wish the line was shorter or they took reservations because being quoted an hour's wait time is just too much for my lack of patience 
the pork belly is definitely a must!!!! the service there was very good  however i tried ma la soup for the first time  it's not really my thing but for those who like spicy herb kinda soul would like it for sure 
love the atmosphere here  though a bit noisy because they had to cram a lot of people in  as for the food  it wasn't bad  a bit on the salty side but pretty decent and spicy  my biggest complaint is the quantity of food served per dish  don't be fooled by the averagely priced items on the menu  when they came  i was shocked as how little content (meat in particular  lots of sauces) they contain  my mom and i ordered three dishes (which is usually way more than enough in other chinese restaurants) but we finished all without a problem   though it seems a lot of meat was provided at first glance  underneath is all cheap vegetables and scallions  a bit disappointed 
i thought it was a really nice and beautiful restaurant  the decor is on point  the food was expensive i'd say  but definitely worth trying  i didn't enjoy it as much as my friend did  but that's all relative  the service was good  they came to change our plates since we ordered crab  sorry i forgot to take pics of the meal  but we also ordered cabbage and spicy chicken 
if you are in flushing  this place is a must  when you walk down into the restaurant you are greeted by a small koi pond and a friendly host  the decor is elegant and the staff was excellent  every dish my wife and i ordered had great presentation and was delicious  we had the sliced pork belly with chili garlic soy as an appetizer  this was not spicy but very flavorful  for the main dishes we had the braised fish head w  pickled chili and the fried pig intestines w  red pepper  both were outstanding  as the side  we had spinach w  garlic  lovely garlic flavor we can't wait to go back to try more 
this place does not close at 11  at least not on sundays  we came in around 10 30 and they had clients coming in at 11  service is attentive  place is a bit smaller than what it looks like from the outside but the decor was cute  lots of wooden benches and birds nest looking lamps  there's a koi fish pond in the front which was pretty cool  i fell for the photos and ordered the pork and cucumber hanging from the wooden easel  the spicy sauce was delicious  sour veggie fish is a must  this place makes it the best i ever had  the fish was fresh and melted in your mouth and the broth was just that right but or sour with a kick of spiciness  pork belly and grapes in clay pot was way too sweet for me  the cabbage stir friend with black bean and meat was good  we also got some peking duck sort of dish  i think it was beef  they heated an oil fire and finished cooking the strips of meat at the table and you put it in a mini bun with spicy sauce and cucumber and scallion    it was soso  come for the sichuan dishes 
have heard about this place for a long time and finally got a chance to check it out  the restaurant located on 1 f of fulton square  it took us a while to figure it out  we ordered sliced pork belly w  chilly garlic soy  braised frog w  spicy chilly broth  whole tilapia w  wild pepper in stone bowl  spicy pork aorta  sautéed spinach w  garlic  though chicken feet was a miss  the complimentary spicy cabbage and tong sui compensated it  food came really quickly as the server told us  and they refilled the tea pot frequently  after 5 30 pm on weekends there was a wait 
friendly services  i believe it was the manager that helped us  the wait was average  for a table of four on saturday night  we waited for 45 mins  the food was average  we tried few bowls  i recommend trying the sour and spicy fish bowl  it definitely required a good skill to make that  i am not a fan of the recommend appetizer of the bacon mix with cucumber although it has a good presentation  but the taste is just not as pleasant to me  however  it seems like a signature dish that everyone order  worth a try for sure~
best sichuan style food we had in nyc area cold dish   螺片with芥末seasoning   very fresh   on the pricey side  but yummy 水煮鱼 and 酸汤肥牛 were also very delicious   just me and my husband so we didn't order much   will definitely be back for more   it is on the pricey side  but it is delicious   i'd rather spend a few more bucks for authenticity 
everything tasted perfect today  nothing too salty or too spicy everything was on point expect that beef with bun was nothing too special  food came real fast too 
the parents were in town and after going all the way to flushing for an authentic szechuan meal  we left satisfied and happy  the restaurant decor is absolutely beautiful  and service is impeccable   especially for chinatown standards  we got a few cold dishes (the best of szechuan) and some sautéed cabbage and kung pao chicken   it was all tasty  there can be a bit of a wait and prices are higher than what's standard for the area  but the ambience and proper service make up for this 
been here for couple times  my friend recommended this place when we came to work for the first time  then i keep coming back every time i come to flushing  it will be better if they serve thin rice noodle in the fish bowl as the traditional way of cooking 
amazing decor  spicy flavorful food  attentive staff  soothing chinese harp music in the restrooms  lol  you can't go wrong with szechuan mountain house  definitely a favorite of mine now  get the sliced pork belly and cucumber with garlic chili oil and the chicken with red chili (in the shovel!) 
we went to szechuan mountain house when we found out that our beloved mapo szechuan next block closed down  the restaurant looks very nice  great decorations and very cute teapots and cups  food was good  i absolutely loved spicy beef with chilli peppers  it was even better than mapo's what we didn't love menu is very limited   i didn't find another meat dish i would like  too much seafood  no duck at all my wife didn't like the fish they brought and asked for an appetizer instead  they charged us for the appetizer and $25 for the fish she didn't eat  not even a discount we might not come back because of that 
the best so far! i'm so glad i tried this new place out as soon as i was in town  and it turned out to be the largest surprise to my ny trip  growing up in szechuan  i've been craving for authentic restaurants for long  and i'm happy to claim szechuan mountain house as my holy grail after my former favorites la vie and cafe china went south green pepper fish  eels  and garlic pork slices were so good that i almost bursted into (happy) tears 
if you're ever in the area and are craving spicy szechuan food  look no further  upon walking into the restaurant  my boyfriend and i were greeted with dimmed lighting  soft chinese music  rustic decor  and servers rushing towards us  welcoming us in chinese  we came at an odd hour of the day (~3pm) and were seating immediately in the practically empty restaurant  there is a good mix of large and small tables  but i'm not particularly certain as to how crowded it'll get hard it'll be to get a table during the busy hours there was a small complimentary salad waiting for us at our table when we arrived; it consisted of lettuce  spicy peppers  and chili oil  it was definitely unique  i have never had a spicy salad before  there was also a pot of tea atop a small flame on the table  available for us to refill our cups to our liking  the menu had a wide selection of dishes  but as someone who loves spice but can't handle it  i was focusing more on the mild plates  i settled on the garlic and minced pork only to find out that they didn't have it  which was a complete bummer  my waiter didn't warn us of unavailable items prior to taking our orders  which definitely slowed the ordering process down  ultimately  i ordered the ma po tofu while my boyfriend ordered a spicy chicken dish (not completely sure what it's actually called)  we also decided to order the pork belly that we saw other tables order  after we finished our meals  we were presented with dessert "on the house"  i wasn't completely sure what it was that they gave us  but it was a clear sweet syrup like base with coconut bits and fruits  nonetheless  it was super refreshing (and free)!the lack of stars is for the price and service  yes  the restaurant is nice  but their prices compared to those of other restaurants in the area?! definitely on the expensive end  as for service  we had to flag down a few waiters to get our teapot refilled because apparently only our specific waiter could do it (yet the other waiters just told us that they'll tell him and never did)  i was also a bit upset they didn't have the garlic and minced pork dish i wanted; again  a lack of information provided by the server 
i loved this restaurant! tonight we ordered 2 dishes  the first one was perfect ! then we waited 25 min for the second one that we ordered at the same time  it is a dish i particularly adore but on top of being late it was soggy and very few and small pieces were present in the plate  we told the waiter  he proposed to take it away (which is a good thing from him) but never proposed for another option  he actually came back to defend his chef saying that it was 2 batches together and that we should have asked earlier to replace it  he made it sound like we were begging for a free meal when we were just asking for a descent plate at 22$    so long   
a bit hard to find if you are not familiar with the area  and parking sucks as anywhere in flushing   with that being said i still recommend you go! food is great if you're into the sezchuan spicy  my favorite here is the spicy fried chicken  it hurts so good in your mouth!  it is a bit pricey so i don't come here too often  but the amount of serving is definitely good for at least 2 people  ambiance is also really nice   
call ahead an hour before to get a number  this place gets busy every night! very impressed with their whole fish dishes! they serve complimentary jasmine tea with great aroma  and the staff came to refill the teapot very often! will definitely come back again!
i decided to check this place out on recommendation from a friend  great interior design and located conveniently in 1 fulton square in flushing  food was good  though i must comment that the（ 什么）跳水鸡 (the water jumping chicken  forgot the name) was really bland tasting despite the sauce  it wasn't marinated at all so barely had taste    the good thing though is that this szechuan restaurant does not kill you with its spiciness  it's spicy  but fit for the average non spicy eater  overall the food was good  we ordered eggplant and string beans (which definitely could use a lot more string beans  see pic) and the bamboo pork  and popular szechuan chili fish  we also ordered hot and sour soup which was very large (feeds 6) for such little price  total came out to be $77 for a family of 4  the tea was so cute too and smelled great  it sat on top of a tea light and was often refilled  only other minor details noted was a tea cup was chipped which could harm someone's lip  and a bowl was chipped  other than that  i would go again 
phenomenal! love the spiciness  this location has more to offer on the menu  but i think the one in flushing has better taste 
atmosphere is nice  food is ok  better than the normal chinese for sure yet not the best 
one of the few chinese restaurants that use proper oil (i can only eat canola oil  grape seed oil or pork oil) that doesn't make me sick  so a five star on healthy food right there!i'm not a big fan of spicy food and none of their dishes use spicy sauce  all of them come from natural vege source like chili pepper  another healthy tip for ladies who are afraid of acne popping out after hot food  i think their food is acne friendly the atmosphere is vivid  a bit noisy but you don't need to shout to let your partner hear you like its peers  you raise your voice a bit and they can hear you   ) very good experience! everything ok the mild side  from spicy level to sweet level  very close to home made and maintain a high standard for healthy foodies like me   )
wow! it you love authentic spicy szechuan dishes this is the place for you  the only problem is selecting your dishes because they all look so good!
beautiful restaurant delicious szechuan cuisine  the best szechuan food in the area  every dish is so good  even the non spicy one 
very nice ambience  modern decor  unique menu with many what i would call new sichuan dishes  i was impressed  it isn't a typical四川 restaurant  worth a try  would have liked more crazy spicy dishes to choose from 
the service is pretty good of this place  the waiters and waitress are busy but they don't ignore people  they change plates for you  arrange the dishes on the table  and respond when you have needs  the food  i would say  is okay  some dishes are creative  like the sliced pork belly hanging on the rack  every dish is the kind of the same kind of spicy  wish the flavor was better 
dislike  had high expectations due to the reviews  food was mediocre and bad service  to top it off  i got food poisoning  would definitely not return  be warn   the restaurant does not split the check  you cannot pay part of the check in cash and part with credit card  nor would they allow customers to pay with multiple credit cards  it's all or nothing 
this is as good as it gets outside of chengdu !! the la zi ji (chicken with red peppers) and shui zhu yu (fish in hot chili broth) is outstanding  not just spicy but with great ma la (numbing pepper) flavor we also had pea shoots and shrimp with spicy pepper and they were both excellent a great addition to the neighborhood !!
the only good chinese restaurant in manhattan that isn't just a noodle shop  im extremely confident in that statement  im literally obsessed  the only complaint is that i cant really come here for a random meal by myself because all their dishes are family style to the max pros  really good ambiance  cute historic interior design  good customer service  great authentic food  really fragrant peppercorns  they refill your tea every five minutes  wifi  not yet columbusedcons  too much food for one person
i'm a heavy spicy eater  so i felt like some of the dishes weren't spicy enough  but they were still delicious! yes  the it's a tiny bit over priced  but i love szechuan food so i'm not going to complain  oddly loved the   slices beef with sour soup (it was wonderfully warming  perfect balance)spicy mung bean jello salad stew talapia with chili (could use a little more fish  but it was yummy)*will definitely go back to try other dishes!definitely make a reservation  when i arrived at the restaurant  there were plenty of people lined up outside  no thank you!  ) service could be better   ? i asked for a glass of water maybe 5x (food gets kinda salty after a while  so don't forget to ask for water!) and it finally came after like 20 minutes 
on a freezing tuesday night we had a 30 minute wait  the restaurant was filled with chinese millenials  the menu had pictures for those of us with limited chinese reading abilities  peeking at other tables and matching up with the pictures ordered and devoured thinly sliced pork belly w  cucumber and chili sauce  a bubbling cauldron of cabbage with spices  finishing with chunks of pork belly and large grapes in a rich spicy sauce  the tea was in an iron pot with a candle to keep warm     service was fine  everybody friendly and helpful  with many more dishes to try      this is definitely not your neighborhood takeout menu     
i wanted to come here for quite a while now and i finally got the chance to try out the food with my fam  the interior design was very much  got that nice traditional vibe to it  after ordering our food  the tea that they offer was nice  the smell was jasmine and the tea was just super refreshing  they will also give us a small bowl of white fermented cabbage drizzled with chili oil  tasted a bit like kimchi since it's got the sourness but also a hit of spice which is delish  now about the food i ordered    1  fish filets with pickled vegetable soup  $25 95 i loved it so much! the fish was soft and the flavor was great! soup is not spicy for those who cannot eat spice  *recommend*2  pineapple fried rice  $16 95didn't like it at all  the rice wasn't good (texture wise) and the flavor was bland  i would say it's overpriced  3   spicy beef intestine(?) i forgot the name of that one  $19 95 loved the spice and the sauce that kinda looks like soup was super flavorful  this dish would go great with a bowl of white rice  *recommend* be aware there's a lot of chili peppers and corn pepper seeds  4  spicy fried pig intestine  $18 95crispy and flavorful  wish they put less chili pepper and corn pepper seeds  *recommend*5  braised pork with cherry  $15 95pork was super soft  non spicy dish  the cherry is actually grapes  also super good  i loved the sweetness it gives the pork  sauce was delicious also  *recommend* total including tax and tip was about $121  which isn't bad at all  keep in mind that the portion is actually quite big; especially the soup and the spicy beef intestine plate  *i posted up some pics*i was glad we came here early (arrived around 12pm on a sunday) because after 12 30pm more people came of course there was a line  don't think they take reservations since the restaurant itself is small  about 20 tables   i would come back with friends and try the other dishes next time  )
not fresh  not tasty  not spicy  pricey  please go to la or szechuan try the real szechuan food 
i love sichuanese food  it boldly harnesses oil to its maximum potential  and the intricate levels of spiciness are exquisite  utilizing ginger  numbing peppercorns  spicy fermented beans  hot peppers  and chili oil  sichuanese's iconic bright red dishes typically have flavors that fortify each other without being overwhelming  unlike in most cuisines where subtlety and gentle harmony is paramount  sichuanese food is dynamic and robust szechuan mountain house is an absolutely gorgeous restaurant  with a fountain near the front as well as bamboo stairs and paintings adorning the walls  this restaurant was offering the promise of a great meal  we ordered the honey grapefruit drink; pigs blood  tripe  and intestine soup; chongqing chicken; mapo tofu; and liang fen food (3 5 5)honey grapefruit drink (4 5)  honey and grapefruit is one of those classic combinations that deserves to be as beloved as strawberries and cream  this drink felt pretty much like unadulterated grapefruit and honey  in fact  there was grapefruit pulp in the drink itself  a sure sign that the drink was fresh and made in house  as refreshing as it was  the drink was a little too sweet  especially as we neared the end  and it would have been worlds better served colder pigs blood soup (2 5)  i'm just going to preface this by saying that i don't actually know what this ought to taste like  however  i personally did not enjoy it very much at all  the flavors were not all completely there because it was masked by an overwhelming bitter aftertaste from the intestines (and this coming from somebody who actually likes pork intestines) which probably means the intestines weren't properly cleaned  while the sichuanese friends at my table seemed to think it tasted fine  i suppose it is worth nothing that it was also the only dish that wasn't finished by the end of the night chongqing chicken (3 5)  who loves fried chicken? who loves fried chicken with green onions  garlic chips  and spice? chongqing chicken is probably the best starting dish for anyone trying to get into authentic sichuanese food  it is crispy and has flavor in spades  and this chongqing chicken was no different  however  i personally found that most of the chicken was cut just a tiny bit too small which made it pretty difficult to eat  try eating a bowl of rice 3 grains at a time and you'll know what i mean  also  several of the pieces had small bone shards in them   it's not a pleasant experience fishing around your mouth for that little particular piece of bone! pro tip  don't actually eat the numerous chilies that come in the dish mapo tofu (3 5)  mapo tofu is one of my absolute favorite dishes of any cuisine of all time which is probably why i am judging this dish a little more harshly than the others  when prepared well it is so delicious  the mellow sweetness of the leeks onions paired with the savory fermented beans rounds the mounting spice of the chilies  the numbing spice is both fragrant and earthy in such a way that it reignites the softened spice  the tofu is just firm enough to hold together but delicate enough to absorb the flavor  of course there is ground pork  too  but the tofu ends up being the real star  because of its texture  it picks up enough of the mapo flavor to be delicious while not being too salty  mapo tofu is the ultimate sichuanese food  the mapo tofu here is ok  it's definitely better than anything you would be able to find at any standard chinese takeout  but that's a given  szechuan mountain's version just lacked oomph  it was too light on the sichuan peppercorns  so suddenly the sweetness became more prominent and the spiciness was no longer as defined  instead of humming  the spice in the dish flat lined  and that's a problem when the main protein of the dish is the relatively bland and humble tofu     liang fen (5 5)  liang fen is good  the sauce was pretty good and the noodles had the right texture  i found myself wishing that there was more of it! for newcomers to sichuanese cuisine  this might be a difficult dish to immediately enjoy because of its texture  the noodles are slippery  they should never be slimy  stale on the edges  or grainy in texture  but still picks up just enough of the delicious chili oil flavor to stand out as great starter dish altogether  i wish this restaurant had done more  i love sichuanese food  i've been to sichuan  and i've eaten sichuanese food at friends' homes  restaurants in china  and restaurants all throughout the united states  i mean honestly  the food here wasn't bad  the amalgamation of errors here and there just unhinged the cohesion of the meal 
different but solid food  definitely not take out and worthy of the wait  flushing is definitely the borough that's killing it with the chinese cuisine  take the train or drive  it's definitely worth it 
first time trying this place and it's amazingly good  must get the fried corn with salty eggs  but don't get the white pork belly from appetizer because there's not much taste to it  everything else kinda taste similar because it's all mala spicy
fancy chinese restaurant  really crowded so expect a wait  i recommend calling ahead to make reservations  i like their teapot a lot  it looks really nice  hanging pork is a must order dish here  they also have really good dessert soup with clear jelly  price is a bit higher than usual considering you're in flushing but it's still a popular place 
everything's fancy but i doubt that i will come back again szechuan mountain house is definitely the new jam in flushing  it has been well recognized by chinese foodie social media in nyc  i heard  i came  i tasted shall we begin with their decorations? have not been to flushing for 18 months  i got amazed by how much flushing has not changed  but luckily  szechuan mountain house is located in a new food court(hotel food building) on prince street  the decoration is based on the mountain life in szechuan  some chinese paintings are hanging on the wall but it seems like no one gives a rat ass about it  the decoration is very good made me feel like i am almost at some high end chinese restaurants in china food is okay  i gradually get sick of spicy food  i did not mean that they are not good  i do like spicy food sometimes  but for most time they ruin the flavor of what true vegetables or meats tastes like  some times  the over spice flavor covered the unfreshness of some sort of ingredient and if i tasted it and sensed it i felt like i am really upset the flavor here is alright but fantastic  you can give it a try but that's it 
i went there with three other friends on a saturday  they said that we can't make reservation for less than six people  so we went around 5 30pm to avoid the crowd and waiting time  the decor  every bit and piece of the restaurant brings a hint of home and we absolutely fell for the traditional chinese style interior design  serving time  we were seated right away since we avoided the peak time  and shortly after  we were served with tea and a small plate of marinated cabbage appetizer  we pretty much knew what we wanted to order prior to going  so we ordered our food very quickly  i was actually surprised by how fast the food came  i think the dessert came around five minutes after  and then everything else came soon after the food  all my friends were pretty satisfied with the food! we ordered four dishes and a dessert  and we all felt full afterwards  i love spicy food and can tolerate a pretty high spicy level  for my taste  the spicy level is decent and should be tolerable for most people  but some dishes sure made my tongue feel slightly numb which i love  we loved everything we ordered except for the dish of loofah with chopped garlic on top  it's still an okay dish but we felt like they are nothing special than your regular boiled loofah   just looked fancy overall  i'll give a 9 10  i took one point off because the portion is honestly a bit smaller than excepted  and the dishes are a bit pricy for the amount they offer if you have an affair with szechuanese food and spicy food in general  then try this place out  it should be a hit!
sunday night about 930pm this place is jammin'  full house but we were lucky to be seated immediately  the szechuanese mala junkie that i am  cannot wait to get my hands on what yelpers have been raving  we tried ordering the mala dry pot with frogs  sold out  beef brisket stew with potatoes  sold out  in short  the malas were all not available except for intestines and cabbage  who wants straight up cabbage? hence we tried something risky and settled for the mala pig intestines  and the tripe and beef tendons in hot oil to start food arrived fairly quickly after ordering  pig intestines were amazing! their mala is on point! they were fried crispy and i got over the fact that it's innards fast  when it taste like fried chicken breading  each dish was well played and presented based off of one on going theme  ancient china during the dynasties  menus were presented in what looked like hand bonded books  chinese paintings plastered on the dining area  and the restaurant overall decorated to be a wooden shack  service  though there were plenty of wait staff  i got the impression that there's just a lack of coordination and plenty of them distracted  we asked for our remaining to be doggy bagged  wait or took the plate and left it sitting in the back forgotten  it's not until i pointed it out did he remember  our drinks were never refilled  though we were seated only a table away from where most of them congregate  none of them would proactively acknowledge us until you get their attention  bathroom situation  there's only one stall stall for each  def not enough considering the amount of traffic  two attempts at washing my hands failed as the girls before me were taking way too long  ended up going into the men's  oops  all in all  their food did live up to all the hype  however the service is in great need for improvement  though service was possibly the only downfall  i left last night with great disappointment overall  unfortunately i'm not dying to come back  though their food is one of the better szechuanese that i've had 
waited about 20 mins for the first dish  all three dishes were too light and mild  not spicy at all  all dishes were below our expectation  most of the bowls and plates were cracked! overall disappointed!
well i must say i ate in many chinese restaurants ( married to a taiwanese)i love this place very much   everything i tried was delicious   very authentic flavor and ridiculously good tastei love the beef tripe   pork and cabbage   spicy chickenstaff is super nice and friendlywill come back for more
there's usually a wait  its best to call for a reservation if you've a party of 4 or more  very nice decor  clean and excellent service for a chinese restaurant  very attentive  decent portion serving  food was delicious and authentic  highly recommend  especially for spicy lovers!
food is very good  every dish has its own distinct taste  not the best szechuan restaurant i've been to but certainly a place i would come back  it's aleays packed with people  decor is very cozy and stylish  has szechuan theme going on  now  the service  the waiters here are incredible  they work as a team  taking care of their customers like i never seen before  i have been to many upscale restaurants  even ones run by iron chef and many american restaurant   the waiters in szechuan mountain house beat the other restaurant service hands down  they constantly fill your teapot before it's even half empty  keep taking away the dishes that has garbage in it  most impressive is when i knock my chopsticks off table by accident  the waiter already delivered a pair of new chopstick in front of me even before i bend down to pick up the chopsticks on the floor  now  that's attentive  its excellent foods and impeccable service  only complain is line to wait for table is too long  worthwhile to call ahead to make a reservation 
i don't really have a lot of szechuan food in my life  but most of the food available in this restaurant i haven't seen from other restaurant  the food is tasted great!!!!  the most impressed is the hot tea pot is keeping warm all the time by putting a candle fire underneath  that's a sweet idea 
this is a nice place to go anytime  there is a reason for the waiting time  the spicy food are very good  spicy fish is recommended  i came here to eat once a while and will always go back  i like all the appetizers! u gotta go there & try!
this might be the best sichuan food i've had in the states most of the time when you order sichuan food in the us  the dishes look like they pack a lot of spice  but instead the flavor ends up being quite tame  that is definitely not the case here  here the numbing mala sneaks up on you until you are reduced to a nervous sweating wreck  except the flavor is so addicting that you can't help but dive in for more  we got the spicy beef soup (a preparation which i've seen pretty frequently in china  but this is the first time i've encountered it in the us)  fried pork intestine  chongqing chicken  and mao xue wang  all of them were very well executed and are highly recommended this place was packed at dinnertime  but service was great  the decor was very nice for a chinese restaurant and not tacky at all my only complaint would be that the dishes are pricy (~$20 for many entrees)  however i do feel that this is a rare case when the food and atmosphere of the place justify the price  if anything  i hope that there will be more restaurants like this serving uncompromised  really authentic chinese food in a nice setting in the years to come 
we finally came and tried out this place  i have to say it's disappointing nice ambience  decor and plate setting i walked in with 2 moms with strollers  they were greeted by the manager(in suit)  and he helped them carrying the strollers downstairs  ( not very stroller friendly)  the receptionist is busy with another customer  she saw me but i wasn't greeted  i saw my party and just went inside our waiter missed one of our orders and placed a leftover to go bag on our very crowded table  the food is in small portions and mediocre comparing to other szechuan restaurants in flushing  maybe i would come back for business meals with out of town clients 
the fancier and pricier alternative to szechuan gourmet  been wanting to try this place for awhile but they are usually packed  this past sunday friends decided to go and we joined them  even though it was torrential downpouring outside there  was a line  even with ressies we still had to wait ten minutes  it definitely gets points for concept and cleanliness being in the new hyatt place complex  ordered a bunch of things for our party of 6  started off with the hanging cucumber and bacon appie with a red chili garlic sauce  think a lot of tables for ordered that  very fragrant and a nice taste  next up was the shrimp balls  crunchy and tasty  the fish soup was milky and just how we like it  then came the stuffed bitter gourd  i think the gourd may have been a bad one as it had a really strange taste to it unlike how bitter gourd normally tastes  the greens that we had was super young and tasty! the crab and roe baked rice was amazing  the fat from the roe melted into the rice  yummo! the chicken in red sichuan pepper oil 雞公casserole was pretty tasty!! unfortunately our crew was already stuffed  we brought that home and had it the next night  tasted even better!!! they brought a purple sweet potato mash on taro chips for dessert and we thought that was a bit too sweet  no need to add sugar to that mash as purple sweet potatoes are naturally sweet enough  also they brought a clear dessert soup that helped cool our numb mouths which was nice  service was prompt and friendly  would def come back with a crew who appreciates mind numbing mala!
my friends' highly recommendation we came on friday night and we just two have 30 minus wait the food is not super spicy or salty here but instead it emphasizes the balance between the ingredients and sauce we got a few cold dishes (the best of szechuan) and some sautéed cabbage and kung pao chicken   we also decided to order the pork belly that we saw other tables order  it was all tasty we were impressed with the service and their interior decoration as well  i like the design and many details such as chopsticks  teapot and cups   try this place out  it should be a hit!
food was good  it absorbed the authentic part of szechuan cuisine yet the was definitely modified a bit to reach a more balanced  more "western" type standard  nothing's too spicy or salty which is a good thing  even though it's bit pricey comparing to other chinese restaurant  i think it's worth a visit  especially if you are looking for place to accommodate special guests since the interior ambience is much better than average chinese restaurant 
the place is great! good authentic food! really liked the atmosphere and service as well highly recommend!
so famous and so disappointed    we came in as a group of 8 and ordered a looot  almost nothing impressive and a lot not delicious at all    will never come back
been to this place three times now  never a disappointment! it is not pricey because the portion size for entrees is relatively big  although it is a szechuan place and known for the spiciness  you can request to have your food made in mild spicy although this place is usually crowded  but luckily  my friends and i didn't have to wait a minute when we were there  they also take reservations!
authentic szechuan restaurant with cool decor and great service  if you are not familiar with szechuan cuisine or have a low tolerance for spicy food  be careful! some dishes are definitely on the more spicy side  although you can find plenty of milder options on the menu to balance it out for appetizer  we ordered the pork belly and cucumber slices  which has a cool interesting quirky presentation  it pretty much looks like laundry hanging from a drying rack    the cucumber slices balance out the fattiness of the pork belly  and the garlic chili oil dipping sauce is heavenly for main dishes  we ordered the pickled vegetable beef soup and fried potato shrimp balls  the pickle vegetable beef soup is sour and spicy  which is very tasty  we ordered the beef one instead of the more popular fish option  since we just didn't fee like dealing with fish bones  other than the beef slices  there were taro vermicelli knots  rice cake slices  and pickled vegetables in there  the fried shrimp balls was a non spicy option  it is made to order and very crispy on the outside  the shrimp itself is dipped in some sort of mayo mixture (tastes like japanese kewpie mayo to me)  so the overall taste is sweet and slightly sour  the portions are pretty big here  the 2 of us ended up taking a lot of the beef soup to go  at the end they also bring you a free dessert of a cold lotus seed papaya soup  i would definitely visit again to try their other dishes!
came in late afternoon for lunch with 5 adults and 3 kids (all under 2) and the service was impeccable  i can't really take spicy food  so i thought my options were limited but everything i ordered was delicious and distinctive in flavor  i loved the pineapple fried rice and the beef egg drop soup  the waiter said the fried rice was a little spicy but it wasn't at all  i definitely would be back for the service alone 
i really liked this place   from services  ambience  to food  the environment here resembles that in some authentic chinese restaurants   with good decor  visually appealing menu  and efficient services  for me  there wasn't much wait when i visited  the food is above average  but it's not on par with some of the most authentic szechuan food i've ever had in chengdu  it's not flavorful and spicy enough consider it's a szechuan restaurant  i guess the flavor will fit people who don't eat that much spicy food better  overall a pleasant place to visit 
this is the best szechuan restaurant in ny  the food is very decent and authentic  the fish is a most order  which reminded me of what i had in china before 
eating here makes you feel like you are in the chinese countryside  much attention was put into the decor of the restaurant  i loved the rustic look of the wooden doors and furniture  waterfalls  koi pond  traditional wall paintings and poetry scrolls  even though the theme is very rural and traditional  the food is quite modernized and beautifully presented  sliced pork belly w  chili garlic soy ($9 95)   this was an amusing appetizer  strips of thinly sliced pork belly and cucumber are hanged on a contraption with a dish of intensely flavored garlic chili oil underneath  because the main component of the sauce was fresh garlic puree  all the garlic molecules released its intense spicy bitter flavors so the it was too garlicky to my taste (7 10) braised fish and tomato w  sour soup ($26 95)   this soup was sour and spicy almost like a tom yum soup  there wasn't much meat on the fish  in fact  it was quite boney and was just heads and tails  i didn't enjoy the fish as much as the soup itself  (6 10)fried cabbage w  soy sauce ($13 95)   surprisingly this simple dish was my favorite of the meal  served in a mini wok over a flame  the cabbage absorbed the delicious sweet and garlicky soy sauce  also there was bits of tender pork belly as well  (9 10)kung pao chicken ($12 95)   i almost had to ridicule myself for ordering something so associated to americanized chinese food but this dish wasn't that bad  unlike the overly sweet and cornsyrupy american counterpart  this dish was mildly sweet with a stronger flavor of chinese dark vinegar (7 10)service was friendly and tried their best to help even though their english was limited  szechuan mountain house is one of the few high end chinese restaurants in the city that does a great job in balancing authenticity with presentation  you get to enjoy traditional flavors without sitting in dirty hole in the walls and still pay similar prices 
authentic and amazing! as a white tourist that has little experience with chinese food and culture i felt very welcomed  the employees even gave our family a free dessert! the food was delicious (super spicy though if you can't handle spice be careful!)  please check out this place  you won't regret it 
before i tried out this place  i had heard some negative comments about it   too pricy  small portion and not authentic  etc   so even though i very tempted to try out this place when it was just opened  i waited a long time to actually stepped a foot inside this restaurant   but the experience was out of my expectation   first  i like the decor  it was very 中國風。the music they play is pretty calming   secondly  they serve real tea!! in a very heavy teapot!  lol! and we like the dishes we ordered!  we order the fresh pepper fish   it was very flavorful   and it was hot!!  fish was very fresh  i wish it was a little bigger though  hahaha   everything else was pretty good   nice plates and good presentation   price was a little on the higher end  but i think it's worth it!
we ordered total 5 dishes and we decided to pack 4 of them to go  when we got home  we found out that there were only three dishes! if you wanna pack anything to go  do it yourself  i have been to this restaurant three times with my friends  two of my experiences were awful  awful place!!!打包4个菜，看着他们端走，和他们确定打包四个菜。回家才发现，只有3个菜。菜的味道也一般般，只有一道我比较偏爱。而且之前陪朋友来不让我们两个人坐在卡座说怕到了饭点后面的人没有位置，但是后面来的两组 两个人的都坐了卡座。我确定他们也没有预约。在这地方吃饭，一不小心就被气饱了。
this place finally opens after months of construction    a highend chinese sichuan restaurant  with trends of modern restaurants are getting more popular than the traditional street vendor food  flushing prince st is the pioneer of newly developed restaurants  please note that it's not a traditional sichuan style    meaning do not expect really spicy and numbing tastes  but rather modern sichuan style food interior dec   environment   5  very well designed with dedicated ornaments  the wall decorations are chinese ceramic enamel plates  the tea pot is in traditional jingdezhen style  and the chopsticks are well designed service   5  you know it's a new restaurant and the owner is aiming for a highend experience  the service is of course good during the grand opening  the waiters wear santa hat right now to celebrate this special time of the year  not sure if the service will maintain later on food   3  the display is better than the taste  the experience itself is more important than how you enjoy the food  we  a group of 6  ordered two appetizers and four entrées  first appetizer   phoenix paws (chicken feet in pickle peppers)  i'm very impressed at its display  a bowl of chicken feet sided with spices and leaves  delivering a classy dining atmosphere as if in a mountain  it's about 6 pieces to share second appetizer   spicy mund bean jello salad  this is an important dish to decide if a sichuan restaurant is worthy coming back  however  it's quite disappointing  the bean jelly itself is fresh and chewy  however then sauce doesn't really come along with bean jello  it's more of a sauce for cold noodles  rather than bean jelly jello  it's also about 6 pieces to share as well 1st entrée   stir fried chicken with bone with pepper (鸡软骨)  would thought it will be more spicy  the chicken with bone is not the cut that we expect  the  portion definitely bigger than other entrée s 2nd entrée   boiled blood curd w  other stuff in spicy sauce (  毛血旺）   it's a signature szechuan food with bunch of inners soaked in spicy chilli sauce  not every one would appreciate inners  but chinese people have loved inners for centuries  especially in szechuan style this dish is not too spicy either  small portion 3rd entrée   sautéed loofah w  garlic (白玉 丝瓜）  always wold love to have some veggies to go with spicy food the display of this course is overly too god only 10 pieces in total to share 4th entrée  spicy boiled fish with green pepper  the fish is a whole talipia  rather than fish filet  the fish is pretty big and was cut in slices  tastes pretty good but not spicy enough anyway  this new restaurant worthy trying out  but i'll probably not gonna be back in a while hope it helps! xoxo qq
yea  the 40 minutes wait is a real thing  its not a big restaurant and during dinner time it gets really busy the décor is good  very good  it is beautifully designed  the furniture are ancient chinese style  like those in older chinese movies  combine with ceramics utensils  it aims to give customers a complete immerse dinner experience now let's talk about the thing we can eat  the food is presented very well  but the taste is mediocre  it taste like other szechuan restaurant around  but more expensive  with a immerse experience so let's not forget about that because it's the only selling point ma paul tofu with minced pork  this taste pretty good  tofu is silky and meat is harder  it's like chinese version of spigettistew tilapia with chili (水煮鱼) this is one of the favorite dishes in the szechuan world  it is very numb ing (麻)  i don't mean spicy  it's just that it will numb your mouth for the night  my two other companions didn't like it  they complained that the fish has a weird taste to it  i thought it was weird since it's so spicy it should have cover any weirdness  for me  i couldn't taste anything after my tongue was numbed stir fried pork bone with pepper (脆辣月牙骨) this one was good  we all agree  but for some people who is not used to eating soft bone it might be a weird dish for you  it is a little on the hard side but the taste and the vegetables was making up for it i think the place was hyped up by people posting picture on social media  if you want a good szechuan place to eat  just go across the street  on the other side of prince street  there's a long standing and not as gimmicky restaurant there 
as a chinese  i have to give this spot my utmost approval! the food tastes very authentic  particularly if you love spicy  the decoration overshadows most asian restaurants you'll see in manhattan  the speed and quality of service is surprisingly pleasing given the usual level of crowdedness  they also allow queuing with a number and name so you can go wonder around instead of having to stand at their doorstep waiting for a seat in the cold like a bunch of jackasses overall  highly recommended for anyone looking for an authentic szechuan meal in a beautifully decorated place while enjoying some lovely service try their free jasmine tea  making a coffee drinker convert 
always has a long wait even on a weekday with crappy weather  honestly  the food is a little too mild for szechuan  their presentation of dishes is quite interesting  i personally really enjoyed the ambiance  it has a very traditional twist (so are several other restaurants next door)  however  the tables are way too close to each other and chairs are really uncomfortable for smaller tables  not recommended for large groups  if you wanna impress your non chinese friends coworkers  this might be a good spot 
i found this place via yelp  and seems to be a pretty legit place  and as all legit places in nyc go  they are usually packed with people  so a reservation is highly recommended  well due to my schedule i wasn't able to make a reservation  so i did a walk in  this place was fully packed  i was told i needed to wait about 1 hr for a seat of 1  (i was alone that day) they take your phone number and name and will call you so feel free to wonder around  there are plenty of things  i went upstairs to the t mobile store  wasted plenty of time there so it was perfect timing  the hostess was very friends and attentive  i was seated and the server immediately came  i ordered some very spicy dishes  of course  it's a szechuan restaurant  gotta get what they are famous for  the food came pretty quick  in the meantime  the waitress checked on my multiple times for water and additional requests  i was very pleased with their service  their food is just great  i used to think the beijing noodle no 9 in caesar palace  las vegas was my favorite  but after trying this i changed my mind  it's authentic  and will not let you down  the tastes i remembered from china just came right back to me  i highly recommend anyone to go there  and don't forget to get a reservation 
the best sichuan food i've ever had in us!!! and believe me i've tried many  i feel the ingredients and oil is of good quality and the taste of each dish is different  unlike many other sichuan restaurants! i highly recommend it
i highly recommended this restaurant to anyone who likes spicy food  every dish is nicely presented and it's worth the price  the decor is gorgeous and traditional  i really enjoy the dining environment and will definitely come again 
first  lets starts with what we ordered 1) pickle fish soup  soup was very tasty and good balance between sour and spicy  fish was very fresh and tender 2) cabbage with soy sauce  i think the sauce is little bit too sour 3) spicy crispy intestine，very spicy and hot something good about this restaurant 1) service was very nice  staff was very prompt and polite   2) dining environment was nice  very classics chinese theme and hot tea was very nice and tasty( green tea with honey)
it can be called an authentic szechuan place  but since i've heard so many compromises on this place  it didn't surprised me  those spicy dishes were full of favor  though tasted all the same  but we all agreed that it's a place you can find in nyc that is very close to a real chinese restaurant in china 
we went there for saturday dinner  got there around 7 30pm and waited for about 45mins to get a table for 2  there are lots of dessert bars nearby and are pretty good  so waiting time was not too tough  we ordered a spicy cold noodle as appetizer(川北凉粉）which is very authentic  ordered a chongqing spicy chicken (重庆辣子鸡），also very good  it tastes spicy and also the unique szechuan numbing taste  definitely a very solid choice  also worth mentioning is that the restaurant is very new and nicely decorated
honestly this was my first time trying szechuan food  and it was delicious! i can't eat very spicy foods but there was plenty that i could eat here  the sliced pork belly appetizer was unique and is a must try! i also enjoyed the stir fried chicken with chili as well as the braised pork with cherries the stars isn't only for the food though  presentation of food and ambiance was on point! the restaurant has a modern yet old chinese village design  including a mini pond with live fish swimming in it  each dish looked amazing  with a special touch such as a flower garnish be sure to make a reservation as it is a busy place  the prices seemed fair  less expensive than what i'm used to in manhattan anyhow 
great servicea bit pricey in my opinion  you are paying for the service and atmosphere  food is good  i would come back as long as there is no wait 
havnet had such a great sichuan food for a while  the place is not big but it's crowded on the weekend with chinese  the food is authentic  not super spicy like real sichuan food but the flavor is on point  great selection of sichuan food  and the portions are real generous  unlimited refill jasmine tea and free dessert  i think it's papaya and white fungus soup  there were four of us   ordered 水煮鱼，黄喉，蛋炒饭，手撕包菜，辣子鸡和麻婆豆腐  everything was so good  the price is very fair  all 6 dishes together are $100 before tax  flushing does have a lot of cheap restaurants but with this service and the quality  it's pretty decent  we all left with a happy belly 
we may have been the only non asian customers in the crowded restaurant  which was a good sign to us that we would get excellent food  the service and food were excellent 
i came here around 9pm on a wednesday because i passed by this place numerous times since i am a regular at mister hotpot next door the ambiance is really nice  i liked the little pot of tea and the flame to keep it warm  the tea was quite tasty too the food is ok  nothing special  the pork belly with cucumber was ok  the mapo tofu had no flavor  just drowned in chili oil  the fish filet with preserved vegetables had no flavor either  the soup with the fish filet was very sour and then a little spicy  i've had better szechuan food elsewhere  the only dish that was pretty tasty was the string beans  these four dishes came out to be $68  which was quite pricey the service was good  but we had to ask for rice from 3 different waiters because all our dishes came out but we had no rice  overall  this place is ok to try once but i will never be coming back here again  highly disappointed with the food 
the best sezchuan food in nyc!! the taste is spicy and numb  my favorite food is spicy frog and crab  service is a little bit slow sometimes  but i can understand all waiters are very busy  if you want to try this restaurant in the evening  you had better come early because they have a lot of customers every day 
the foods here taste great!service was fine!the only star lost was for the awkward seating 
omg!!! bad experiences  we want to order something without the some kind of pepper  they rejected us immediately  they just "no" for any questions!! we ordered the sour fish soup  the picture shows the soup was clear  but it came out it's creamy  tasted soso   not recommended the sour sweet pork rib    omg so bad   can't finished one for today  only 1 star 
the food is not as good as expected  their fried rice needs some improvement as it is not salty enough 
horrible service  even  found hair in my food! i really love the food here   but the service is even worst then fj restaurant!
very good and amazing  love the selection here  always good to find a place that has authentic real chinese food  spicy food lovers come here  tried many great dishes that you can't get anywhere else  also love the addition of zanthoxylum  creates an amazing round flavor for some of there most spiciest dishes  yum!
we came with our family we order couple fish and we finished pall the food the food was tasted good only some item there just sold out maybe they are very busy but we order other stuff we want try maybe next time service it's good we will come back try next time
somehow overpriced  some dishes are ok but others sucks  if the price is cheaper it would be great  the store decorates good but they need to pay more attention on their food i am from szechuan originally and i am not a big fan of this one!
whoa  the prince street area is getting high end  lots of new restaurants in just this complex alone  went here on a saturday night near closing  and it was still pretty busy  like many have said  szechuan mountain house has really nice  traditional decor  from the cutlery and tableware to the koi fish waterwheel combo in front  to start  the complementary tea was really good  not the typical tea served in chinese restaurants  i want to say it was jasmine tea  the menu had a pretty good exotic range of choices with quite a few intestine dishes  i'm not too familiar with szechuan cuisine  but the menu was definitely interesting  with lots of things to try  we started with the pork belly with cucumber  it wasn't too flavorful by itself  but the sauce added much needed flavor  albeit being a bit spicy  i was expecting something a bit more flavorful with it being bbq pork belly  but it was ok  my entree was the beef short rib  it was presented peking duck style with the thick steamed buns  it was served with rum that was literally aflame  the entree indeed  was lit  the flavor of the beef short rib was flavorless  from my experience  it was fine with the rum sauce and other additions with the bun  but not great  the beef stew was good  with cartilage and potatoes along with the beef  it wasn't outstanding  but solid  it was probably the best tasting thing in the meal  and it wasn't too great  we didn't really order anything too spicy  so i can't comment on that the presentation  much like the decor  was top notch  also  the service was fast  i think our entrees arrived in probably less than 15 minutes  which was really surprising and welcome  i'm definitely open to trying this place again  but from my experience  the food didn't really match the high end decor and presentation at szechuan mountain house 
the best szechuan restaurant in the states! literally eat here at least once every week  and never get tired of it  service is very nice and satisfying  definitely one of my favorite restaurant 
came here twice so far  one time with a group of 7 people and waited 1 1 2 hours  and another time with a friend and didn't have to wait at all  so tip is  if you're coming with a group of more than 6 people for dinner definitely  call in to make a reservation  even if you have to wait in line  i believe it is worth it to try the authentic taste of szechuan food  i make 水煮鱼 a lot at home  and i often contemplate how szechuan mountain house can make its spicy fish so good  the fresh fish absorbs the chili oil and spicy sauce so well that it makes perfect combination with a bowl of white rice  even though the sliced pork belly with chili garlic soy looks like a captivating dish  i didn't think it was that good  however  i highly recommend their whole tilapia with wild pepper in stone bowl (heat level 3 5)fried corn kernel with salted duck yolk (heat level 0)mapo tofu (heat level  4 5)(saltiness  5 5) fried cabbage with soy sauce (heat level 1 5) **consider as a low level of spice standardif you cannot eat spice  i recommend fish filet with mustard green and stew beef with potato  if you decide to drink alcohol  i recommend to add stir fried chicken with dry red chili (heat level  3 5) ; the pepper fragrant is super crisp and strong  what is interesting is their fried purple potato  i'm not sure if it is fried but there are bits of rock candy on top of the potato  it's a dessert and makes it an interesting wrap up of all the salty dishes  they also provide a complimentary bowl of cooling soup for each person  definitely going to come back to try their braised frog with chili broth 
everything tasted so great  all the dishes are authentic  and i loved their deco and the presentation of the food 
this is the worst place ever  first time my friend got food poisoning while still being inside the restaurant    he threw up the entire meal in their bathroom    and the staff seemed used to this kind of situation so i believe he is not the first one    feels horrible to throw up 40$!!!  do not go!!!
best best best best best szechuan restaurant i've ever had in us!!!! 5 star service and 10 star taste(wish i could give 10 star) if you want the most authentic szechuan food then this should be your first choice  take a look at the hot&spicy fish picture i took! this is the first and only place that how the fish was cut exactly like in china!
it was a good meal  but was the 40 min wait justified? i don't think so  the staff was very polite about the wait and some people stayed  some left  i don't understand the hype other than the pretty interior  i like their plates and silverware  the music was still off the blade clams in garlic sauce tasted very fresh but kind of cold  like they were sitting there for a good 5 mins before they were brought to our table  i almost always order fish filet hot sauce boiled  it's so waterly  this had a nice numbing but it wasn't flavored enough and maybe i just had better spicy filet elsewhere  my usual go to string beans stir fried with minced meat was pretty good  needed more salt  the appetizers were ok despite the not seasoned enough dishes i am still thirsty after 3 hours  it wasn't bad but overall not good enough 
first  i saw a hair in free side dish  they gave me another one  but no apologies  second  a piece of tea leaf stuck on my napkin third  the waiter with spiky hair was dishonest and tricking us into leaving more tips  my friend paid my dinner  then left  so i tried to find out if they left tips for table  the waiter stood by counter for a minute  then told me they not able to check  but my friend just left about 10 minutes ago  i was going to leave tips on table  but thought about it  its very weird that they not able to check  so i went to cashier to ask  the cashier showed me that they left $20 for table  omg     how can u cheat customer like this  you dont even deserve 1 star  if i can i would give u zero star           we will never ever come back 
there is finally an authentic szechuan restaurant in nyc that is comparable to the ones in mainland china (both taste and decoration)  if you can eat spicy  i recommend to request original spicy that has not been adjusted for the taste of the general crowd  i don't think there is any better szechuan food in either flushing or manhattan  the price is reasonable for the taste   make reservations if you are coming for dinner  especially during weekends!!!
i like their food  we had the appetizer with the pork laid on top of the rack  the sauce is absolutely amazing   i used it on some of my other food since it tasted so good  we also had the fried shrimp ball  you can order that for the kids  the will enjoy it  it's cute and yummy  it was packed when we went  definitely will go again 
this is my second review so i've had good experience the first time  one thing i noticed about a lot of reviewers is that that have a sichuan restaurant a lower review because they couldn't handle the heat  i guess thats why they got new menus of spicy dishes to show how much peppers they put in the food  ha the decor for this place was pretty decent  so are the dish plates and other table wares  very unique environment my only complain  the biggestis that the dishes were way too salty tonight as compared to my first time here  we had to send back a veggie dish because all we tasted was just salt  the second time was  we expected it would be  we even metioned to the waiter that our dishes were way too salty  and we requested less salt on the veggie(he's not a very good listener  hopefully that change)  we could barely taste what we were eating tonight because the dishes were made so subpar by the overwhelming salty experience  please use less salt and make sure you try the dishes out before sending it out  i dont have a problem with the spices  just with how we paid money and wasnt able to enjoy our food 
they don't accept reservation under 4people which is doesn't make any sense for me  and they should change that on their page 
went around 9 30 p m on a saturday night  was seated at a small table even though there were larger tables  we quickly requested to be seated at a larger table and they accommodated us  however the wait staff took forever to take our orders and had forgotten to give us our heineken beers  when we asked about it  he brought us coronas     _  no glasses were given for the beers and when we asked for a glass  they gave us warm glasses for the cold beer  the food was mediocre  we had the frog legs with sour pickle soup and stir fried cabbage with soy sauce  both dishes were pretty spicy they definitely need to improve on their service  even the manager was just standing in the front and not really paying attention to the guests  i had to literally flag the waiter down every time  do not come here and pay for overpriced szechuan cuisine and bad service 
they have the best 辣子鸡丁 on earth  omg i can't believe sichuan food could be that authentic before i try out this restaurant  this place is beyond all of the other sichuan restaurant in the city  we're heading there again for friend's birthday tonight 
i came tuesday afternoon with a group of friends  everything was good until we found two unknown items in our food  the first time  the server confirmed it was a part of a dishwashing brush  the server asked if we wanted a new one but we declined because we were pretty full from what we ordered  the server went to the manager for a response but never came back to us  we found the same exact piece few minutes after  i asked for the manager and he said the piece was from a shrimp  the dish we ordered had nothing to do with seafood  so now i question how they prepare the food inside  do you just randomly throw food into different dishes? so what's going to happen if i have a bad seafood allergy? probably won't be returning until they improve on their service and cleanness 
definitely one of the best tasting sichuan place in the neighborhood  love their chicken feet  it's very crunchy yet well marinated  the fish head is my favor dish there  great portion and super fresh  the only complain i have is their fried pork intestine  little too greasy for my taste and the portion is inconsistent  place can get busy during weekend  so make reservation ahead of time 
they don't take reservations unless your party is over 5 people  i came with 3 other people and we had to wait approximately 45 minutes for a table and not to mention we went before the dinner rush  overall  this place is a really modernized restaurant compared to the rest of flushing  we ordered salted duck egg mixed with corn  some beef stew  string beans  and i forgot the last one  the salted egg with corn is unique  but people definitely hyped it up a little too much  the food is not spicy enough for a szechuan restaurant so if you're looking for something spicy  but not burn your tongue off then this is the place to go 
great environment  authentic szechuan food  nice service  it's a bit expensive  but total worth it 
horrible unpleasant service  good food  employees need to go through intensive training re customer services 
one of my favorite szechuan places in nyc   the tables are a little uncomfortable cause there is a crossbar which means i can't sit normally without my knees hitting it and i'm only 6' tall  other than that i can't complain 
it is very nice szechuan restaurant  their food is not really spicy like regular szechuan food  they just got me  if you like spicy food  but you cannot hold too much  then it is the place to come  their plates are beautiful  enjoy the meal 
one of my favorite sichuan restaurant in nyc  it is authentic  every time i go to a sichuan restaurant  i always order shredded pork with garlic sauce  this is a dish that can help me judge whether it is authentic or not  and the restaurant surprised me  the waiters are all very nice 
fairly new restaurant  food were okay  portions were just the right size  not too big and not too small  interior decorations emphasized on bamboo  relaxing  i like how they have elegant looking teacup and teapot  most of the spicy food gives you a little bit of numbess when you eat them but they aren't too spicy to handle  services were good and prices were reasobable 
braised fish head w pickled chili is amazing！stir fired chicken w dry red chili is good too  after dinner，they provide free red bean soup  great customer service～like the interior desgin very much 
best szechuan restaurant in flushing! truly authenticate! i can tell no different between the taste here and the taste in china  the service here is also very good  and the price is reasonable  each of us only spent $28 (containing tax+tip) with very delicious good! highly recommended!
中看不中吃。they try to be fancy in presentation but they really lacked in the taste  our conch with wasabi was covered with way too much wasabi and each bite was a torture  likewise our fish soup was overly spicy and lacked other flavors to accompany it  almost nothing tasted good here 
great environment and nice food ! service is good too !  we walk in at around 6  pm and by 7 pm this place is full house ! it is not very spicy but very delicious  in terms of price  it's relatively expensive compared to other places in flushing  but the interior decorations and service totally make it worth the price !
order the stir fried chicken with dry chili pepper which was good  a little too spicy for my taste but you can ask how spicy you'd like it  depending on your taste  wish the menu had a few more option  for me it was a bit limited  really liked the ambience of the restaurant  had a lot of components of authentic china with a chinese violin  posters  and design of the seats  want to try here again but hopefully get something that doesn't burn out my taste buds too quickly  would recommend!!
first and the most important is bad service  i have to wait like more than 1 hour for available seats  after having my seats finally  i have to wait like forever to be serviced  if i don't ask for a lot of times  after struggling for ordering  i have to wait 20 mins for one course and another 20 mins for another course  and i wait more than 30 mins for my last course  actually they even don't know i have my last course  they just told me "if you wanna your last course  we need to order it now  and you need to wait for 30 mins" 
the wait is long as usually on a typical friday night  about 40 minutes   as soon as we were seated  they gave us a 10% card   the service is absolutely excellent  every staff is very professional  they pay attention to all details and of your needs   food came on a timely manner with superb tastes  definitely recommend this place  note  try going to this place during off peak to avoid long wait 
checked out this place with my friends on a sunday night  maybe the best szechuan food i have ever had by far  service is very good and it only took us about 20 minutes to be seated  (we arrived at 6：15pm without reservation) price is reasonable considering the food quality  we have five people and the price for dinner is $150  including tax and tips  we had 6 dishes in total
one of the best szechuan places i've been to; and i have been to several here in flushing  staff is nice and usually attentive to the customers needs but not overbearing  some food can be very spicy so consider that  for example  i usually like a medium spiciness but can handle a few bites of the hotter items here  a little pricy but not crazy compared to the local restaurants  however i feel it's worth it 
dishes are relatively small and the prices are relatively expensive but at least they taste good  my party showed up still waiting for a couple of people  they dropped off a pot of tea without any cups and didn't check back until the others arrived  even though we would have gotten an appetizer before hand  the little candle used to keep the tea warm went out early and they never changed the tea leaves so after the initial cup  the tea was just warm water  food came out relatively fast and they weren't pushy about getting us to leave after we finished  okay experience but i probably wouldn't choose to come back 
a tad annoying that the wade giles version of sichuan is used in the name of this restaurant  but i'm sure the owner didn't know  anyway  this new sichuan restaurant located in the grand hyatt plaza is absolutely worth a visit  it's on the pricier side  especially for flushing  but you're paying for the atmosphere and service   and the food is pretty damn good to boot  we split the pork belly on a rack (it does literally come on a wooden swing set  but for meat)  eggplant and string bean  mustard green tilapia  and mapo tofu  i would say 2 4 of these were a miss but i could still see the potential and won't fault the restaurant  i'll definitely have a better idea for what i want to order next time around though  the tea sets are fancy  the seating is fancy  and the service is attentive  what else could you ask for?
i give them 5 stars for good service and nice food  my fd was so picky on szechuan food as he tasted the real traditional szechuan food in china  here's the first one szechuan restaurant he said it taste good  we finished the whole dish of the stir fry chicken  decoration is very nice! will come back and very recommended
absolutely delicious  i quite enjoy szechuan food though am by no means an expert   wonderfully cooked food with bright powerful flavors and a heat that really takes its time to develop so the other food flavors are not overwhelmed  the staff was as attentive as can be expected in a packed restaurant at brunch  they were great about suggesting food pairings  the food came really fast and now  eight hours later  i can't stop thinking about it  i tried to convince my wife to go back to flushing for dinner there tonight  but it seems a return visit will have to wait another day   
amazing place to eat! the food is simply amazing  it's the best chinese food i have had in nyc  it's very authentic szechuan food  i was surprised by the services here as well  every waiter waitress is super nice  responsive  and considerate  the only down side is the long wait  we waited for almost one hour  but the restaurant gave us 10% off as compensation  which was really impressive 
love this place so much  haven't eaten any good szchuan food for long time  its little pricey here but definitely worth the money 
i am a flushing native that was never able to pick a favorite restaurant because of all the options  i had a top 5 but no clear #1  now i have it  love at first bite  not sure how long it will last but for now it is the most amazing place that i crave for everyday 
this restaurant has really good business  attracting a lot of customers everyday  at dinner time  it's always crowded  with many people waiting  yes  the decoration of the restaurant is great  and the service is excellent too  but in terms of food  i think it's overrated  for appetizers  we ordered jelly fish with pickle veggie in vinegar and salty pickle duck with pepper  and both disappointed us  jelly fish is chewy as it is supposed to be  but it's kind of hard to bite  and it's not that flavorful  the duck is also not tasty  and feels too spicy if you swallow a chopped piece of pepper by accident  for main dishes  we ordered fried shrimp ball  fish fillets with pickled mustard green  fried shrimp with salted duck egg yolk  stir fried lobster with dry red pepper  stir fried string beans and fried corn kernels with salted duck egg yolk  to be fair  i should say that fried shrimp ball is terrific  very flavorful with a bit of sweet taste  and fish fillets are great too  with a lot of soup and a big portion size  stir fried string beans are also pretty decent  but stir fried lobster is a big disappointment  as the lobster is very small without much meat  and the major part of the dish is basically spices  fried shrimp  and corn kernels with salted duck egg yolk taste a bit too dry and does not have a lot of flavor unless you are a big fan of salted duck yolk  anyway  this is a pretty decent eatery in flushing  but is definitely far from top rated 
everything is expensive here  compared with other restaurants in flushing  i would definitely go to other szechuan or hunan restaurants instead  such as hunan house where prices are acceptable and taste is more authentic  anyway  the fish dish is good and if you wanna try  not recommend the appetizer that everyone orders in the pics  it just looks fancy and taste so so 
there's nothing special about this place  most of the food are pretty plain and the service is poor  we've been waiting for the last course for an hour and they finally told as it was sold out after we try to rush the course 
highly recommend this place if you like authentic spicy sichuan food  the presentation and the food are awesome  service is great! the price is reasonable  will definitely go back and try more dishes  i love it!  )
i dont know if i can call it szechuan food with such a limit menu the owner is very smart  the new appearance of the food is definitely attractive to these americans and abcs who simply and naively believe they know what is chinese spicy food or szechuan food  as a person who was born in china and have some family in chengdu  i have to say some new appearance design ruin the taste   for example  they hangup some sliced pork on the small hanger  i can tell you these hanged dried sliced pork belly is over dried and not good at all!!!when i went there  it was over 90 f outside  and their ac doesnt work very well  the waitress said it was the regular temp of their ac  soooooo i can only understand that they wants to push out the customers who has been sweating sooooo much as fast as possible to get more people in  am i right?
the food is too salted！the men looks like manager is so mean！i just ate 20mins and there is still a lot food in the table，but he just left the check in my table and walk away，even i know there is line in the waiting section，but  i also wait for 30 mins get my table！its not nice like that！never go there anymore！
my girlfriend and i came to this place due to its good reviews  let me start off by saying none of the waiters here speak any english or the basics of it  i had a very hard time trying to get ice water  i had to ask a chinese person next to our table to translate ice water  we ordered the spicy chicken ( cold dish ) spicy fish stew and spinach and garlic sauce  this place was by far the worst place i've been to  i would not be returning to this place 
mapo tofu and doubly cooked pork are ok  the 金针菇酸菜肥牛 is exceptional ! even in chengdu   sichuan it is hard to find a place that does that well in this dish! highly recommended!
go to the place with a friend's birthday today  we have never thought their drinks is very expensive  ourselves with  they say "we can drink  but we have to pay corkage   new york has a regulation  all catering enterprises have no right to interfere with the client whether bring drinks! (except wine) and for the first time we eat!!!! i don't know  the manager is not only no tolerance! is to punish our money! the service was really bad! don't have any show  really here is spend money on sin! this birthday that very bad! his says it will not go 
it's 100% like mainland china szechuan food!!! the cold dish taste really good   interior design excellent   but need to improve service  i live in flushing  so far it's best szechuan food resturant in fishing 
food was delicious  and people were so nice   its second times i came here with friends  
i'm so happy my colleagues brought me here for dinner   raised in la spoiled with great food  i have to tell all this place is superb!  a very skilled chef pays attention to detail and put a lot of thought in preparing his dishes   my favorite is the large sashimi platter we ordered;  quality is fresh  beautifully and delicately cut in the correct thickness    highly recommended!
my friend and i had a good first experience at robata for lunch on a saturday  we came here early when it wasn't busy and we were seated right away  first impressions  interior decor was clean  comfortable and modern  didn't feel like we were in flushing  lol they had a decent sized menu  with plenty of options  including a lunch menu  but we were both craving sashimi  so we went with the sushi sashimi combo for 2 for $80  which included a few pieces of sushi  30 pieces of sashimi and a signature roll of your choice from the menu  we opted for the fantastic box signature roll  which had spicy tuna over salmon and tuna filling  the wait for our food wasn't bad  i think we only waited about 15 minutes  in the meantime  they brought over a small plate of edamame with sea salt sprinkled on top  for us to munch on  this was nice  because many sushi restaurants make you pay for the edamame  and they can charge as much as $5 8  i'll give a solid 4 stars for their presentation of the food  generous slices of sashimi  over a leaf and presented over a bed of shaved ice  and the fantastic box was served on a separate plank  everything tasted pretty good  the fish was of good quality  the signature roll was quite delicious  with a good rice to filling ratio  we really enjoyed the king salmon and the slices of toro were probably the highlight of all the fish! service was pretty good for flushing  the only complaint i have for their service  is the waiter who brought us our food  didn't do a good job in explaining which types of fish was in the combo  and i didn't think the amount of food we got in the combo  warranted an $80 price tag  other than that  this was a great first experience here  i do have to point out  that i really like their restroom  lol the design of the sink is quite interesting  (i didn't have my phone with me  so i couldn't take a pic unfortunately )
food  nothing special  it's not real robata  but good deal for lunch special and their fish is fresh and good quality atmosphere  nice and cleanservice  good for flushing area
food is a 3 5 at best  and price is a 1 5  the uni is bitter and it doesn't really feel that fresh  but it didn't stop them from selling it for $40 a dish  unagi is good but then again  those cold packaged ones from a decent asian market are just as good  except they are probably 70% cheaper  overall this place has not offered anything more than something i can either already get from any grocery market or make myself  and therefore i feel i have been cheated out of my money  i got shilled into this place from a wechat group that recommends restaurants in the new york area  i will not make the same mistake again next time also the waiter never bothered to ask if i want to pack away the leftovers  he kind of just took the away before i could say anything 
the fried rice was good  the robato sushi was okay  if you like crab meat you'll really like it  the spicy angry dragon is good  baked clams were good  bacon with scallops you can't go wrong  robato sushi and sashimi was disappointing  the tuna was not that fresh  the salmon and the white fish was the only fresh fish  the freshness is very important in deciding how well a sushi place is 
robata takes the place of another japanese eatery in the same location but is far better than its predecessor   the menu here is standard japanese with sushi  cooked items like katsu and teriyaki as well as a few noodle dishes to boot the quality of the fish here is pretty good  especially if you're used to getting suspect cuts in other flushing sushi spots   the lunch specials here are also a really good value as you get a lot for your money and its hard to leave hungry service here is also pretty good and is a cut above your usual flushing service   the servers are polite  attentive and treat their patrons well   i'm still not sold that flushing can ever produce an excellent sushi restaurant but this place is a good start   thumbs up 
this is one of the better sushi places in the area  although it was not the best sushi sashimi i have tried  it was fresh and if i was nearby and wanted sushi sashimi i would come here again  the service was great considering that it's in flushing  the staff was friendly and the waitress was really attentive to refilling our hot teas  my family and i were seated at the sushi bar seats since it was busy one weekend night and the staff there were open to talking to us about dessert options (there are some specials that are not on the menu so don't be afraid to ask)  i also tried other foods besides sushi sashimi  the wagyu beef heated up on top of pebbles was a nice presentation  the desserts are worth leaving space for at the end of the meal as well 
a new sushi addition to flushing  and i was pleasantly surprised! at around 6pm on a weekday the restaurant was empty  but other diners began to pile in after we were seated  there's a sushi bar that offers omakase  as well as tables for the regular menu options  we ordered the tuna appetizer as well as another sashimi appetizer to start  plus a dozen oysters; the fish was fresh and nicely seasoned! the oysters were fresh as well  and they were topped with caviar! judging from the pictures on yelp  i had to get the sashimi platter  which is said to feed two  it comes with two additional rolls of your choice  but we ordered two additional rolls on top of that  as well as various separate pieces  the fish was all so fresh  and of course the plating was beautiful! as advised  it is pricey  roughly $100 for the sashimi platter  the servers were very attentive and were there in a second with anything we needed  it is a bit more pricey than your average sushi spot  but i would come back regardless  great addition to the area!
food is mediocre  not so bad but not the best either  the waiter waitress making us to order expensive drinks and extra food  not coming back ever again and i told my friend to avoid this place too 
that was great experience  food was great and service was excellent   durian pancake was great  actually i can't eat durians but this one was totally fine and i ate all of them  i wished i could have two stomachs  lol  anyway i recommend it
very pleasantly surprised at this premium class japanese sushi restaurant in flushing  quality of fish is fresh and texture is mouth watering  we ordered the meat platter and everything on the plate was so thoughtful and experienced so many flavors  it looked like an episode of netflix's chef's table  we also ordered the seafood ceviche and the fish was so fresh  they also gave a large amount  for those who care about service more than food  service here is so attentive menu is very thoughtful and they really care about the tasting experience 
i was mildly impressed with this restaurant  i probably came here a few months back and cannot pin point any memorable moments during my one visit  what i do remember was that i came on a friday night and the restaurant was pretty empty  and yet service was still slow  we did get our beers and waters not too soon after ordering but everything else came at a glacial pace  the food here is average; a 3 on a scale out of 5  the sashimi and sushi were dull in color which made me wonder if the fish was not as fresh as it could be  they do serve ramen here which is hearty because of the broth and noodles  but i've had better ramen in the city at a cheaper price  i will probably not return due to my lack luster experience 
hot and new restaurant in flushing? japanese cuisine? highly rated by yelpers? this meant i had to give it a try! i came by on weekday night and was immediately seated  i decided to try the robata sashimi  which comes with 18 pieces  it was really fresh and nicely plated  as for rolls  we got the dancing eel roll which is an eel wrapped roll with crispy eel on top  i found this to be a very interesting combo and it was pretty tasty as well  i felt it would have been even better if they added crunch inside the roll  the miso cod appetizer was on a skewer with the perfect texture and sweetness  their fried chicken wings was very flavorful and also had a nice presentation  being adventurous  i decided to try their sea urchin a la carte  i normally stray away from ordering this unless it is at an authentic japanese restaurant  their a la carte items come with a choice of sushi (one piece) or sashimi (two pieces)  i opted for the uni sashimi for $9  it usually is a hit or miss at restaurants  unfortunately  the uni was not fresh at all the staff were really friendly and service was exceptional  they kept refilling the waters and even plates! overall my experience here was highly positive  i would rated robata a 6 5 if not for the uni 
came up on my yelp as a new restaurant so i had to go give it a try  i've been craving sushi for a few days now so finally got the chance to come give this little place a try  this place is very nice and clean  the service is good and they are attentive  my cup was full my entire meal  husband and i had ordered the ribeye with bone marrow and they thought we said ribs so the waitress came back to ask if it would be ok if we want to try ribs but we turned it down because we really wanted to try the steak  she was understanding  however it lengthen our time there  so we got steak with one marrow  which was good  the marrow was cooked too burnt on the sides so had that burnt smell to it  but the steak was great  it was cooked medium  we also had the dancing eel roll  that is our third favorite roll in our book of favorite rolls  lol! the crispness of the eel on top is very different  other than these two dishes we also got a sashimi and nigiri boat special which was 28  came with 5 nigiri  12 sashimi and a shrimp tempura rolls  that was all delicious too! would i come back here again? honestly no  the sushi is good  but the price points are not in my range  it was a great place to try though so don't hesitate if you're in the area 
the food is good but not amazing  the ambiance is a little tacky  but go figure  japanese restaurant in flushing  ny  the fish all tasted fresh  but the robata grill items  mainly the meat (ribeye w  bone marrow) seemed a bit too fatty  slightly overpriced for flushing as well  menu is broad  so you can order so many different items off the menu from sashimi  robata grill  and even fusion like appetizers like tuna pizza (something like that )
the food is ok but the price is way too expensive  three of us ordered food around $230  we went to michelin one star restaurant for only $65 per person of tasting menu  i don't know why this restaurant charged that much  we ordered oyster (6) for 20 bucks  the oyster is very very tiny decorating is good  but will never go back 
robata is probably the best japanese restaurant in downtown flushing area  on a warm saturday afternoon  i wanted to try something different other than the typical hotpot  spicy noodles  and dumpling restaurants  i open my trusty yelp app and search for small tapas  robata appears and this japanese restaurant is fairly new in downtown flushing  i decided to check it out the restaurant is hidden in prince tower condominium and located on the first floor next to dolar shop hotpot restaurant  upon entering  the first thing i noticed is the restaurant has a modern contemporary feel and a bar area for solo diner with big screen tv i was seated immediately by their friendly staff and presented with a beautiful picture menu on an engraved wooden clipboard  while i was browsing the menu  i noticed second to the last page says "lunch special" and immediately in disbelief that their robata set lunch is only $12  i ordered the miso black cod set lunch which comes with miso soup  seaweed salad  steam egg  onigiri rice  bacon enoki mushroom  and asparagus  i also ordered the robata sushi the set lunch and the sushi arrived and the presentation was delicate and alluring  i started the sushi  and i was really impressed with the freshness of the fish especially the bluefin toro tuna  the fatty tuna was the best of all  secondly  the robata set lunch also presented on these little charming square wooden boxes  the miso black cod was well seasoned and perfectly grilled  the bacon enoki mushroom skewers tightly rolled together and both were heavenly  lastly  the charcoal grilled onigiri creates a slightly crunchy crust  which has a smokey wood flavor and makes the rice taste so much better  the only thing i regret not checking is their dessert menu  don't judge me they have a decent selection of japanese sake  but their wine and beer list is limited  i would like to see more japanese beer on the menu such as asahi black or any hitachinos overall  i really enjoyed my lunch at robata and i will visit more often especially their lunch set is so affordable for your typical lunch and their upcoming promo  i have found a hidden gem in downtown flushing and will be coming back for more 
man  good reviews led us to this restaurant  first impression was good  nice and clean place with a friendly staff  prices were good and the menu looked good as well  unfortunately  i can't be as positive for the food  sushi was not fresh  at all  i have had sushi in many places  including some well known places in japan  this place was the worst of them all  not fresh at all  in fact  3 of us had stomach issues immediately after  hopefully  it was a one time incident 
best sushi in flushing my god the fish is so fresh  thanks executive chef ming love this place 
just do not like restaurant cheat us when they open a uni  they found the one is not good and fresh  they did not throw it but still put them on the plate  then they took one piece from refrigerator  not a fresh one and put on top of all uni to cover bad ones  the uni taste was really bad  you can see the color difference from picture  the restaurant was trying to cheat customers and charge $40 of uni 
disappointed  the waitress recommended uni to us but it was not fresh at all  it's bitter  we would be glad to pay $40 for something good but i don't think it worth the money  other dishes were fine but no kimchi in kimchi fried rice though 
absolutely impeccable !!!! had the sashimi for two and it was an such an adventure  service was great  beer and sake was on point and complimented the food perfectly  definitely coming back with more people text time!
great location and great environment and friendly service   this location is near heart of the flushing location  clean place for good food  we were there for lunch   there is variety choice on lunch menu   we had sashimi lunch and set lunch box and appetizers   all food were yummy and fresh   i love the set box since it is good size for lunch and variety of food in the box   waiters are nice and friendly  this place is great for couples and family party   we will definitely come back more often 
sushi was really good  miso soup was really good  stir fried udon noodles were really good  fried rice pot was really good  overall really good  don't rely on one meal  some plates are really small  i'd suggest going all in family style to get a bunch of everything to share 
i got take out from there  and so this is not a full reflection of the restaurant  the food was standard  and the delivery was on time  kudos to the delivery man for braving the cold  cold rain! the food just didn't wow me in anyway  and it was a tad expensive for what we got  otherwise  it really wasn't bad  i may try going to the restaurant to try more of their menu items and perhaps see what this excellent service other yelpers speak of is like 
went for lunch on father's day  they have lunch special on sunday and in my opinion it's a really good deal  it was a good experience overall tako salad  4 5 the octopus was well flavored but there's only around $5 thin slices and half of the salad was seaweedtuna lover roll  4 5 it's tuna on top with soft shell crab inside if i remember it correctly  next time i would get this only if there are at least 3 adult it's tasty but after 2 3 pieces you would not want another onepoke lunch special  5 5 we choose tuna & salmon with wasabi yuzu  this is like the japanese sashimi rice bowl which you have sushi rice and sashimi on top  it's very fresh and i love the dressing  for $13 this is definitely worth it robata lunch  5 5 choose 2 veggie  1 meat  and you get miso soup  rice ball  and seaweed salad on the side  i choose miso black cod  it was 2 very tiny little pieces of fish only about 5cm diameter  i choose asparagus and bacon onoki mushroom  it's basically 3 bacon pieces wrap around the onoki mushroom  the riceball is grilled to perfection and very yummy  i love everything on this entry  the portion is very small though  i think a grown men would need at least 2 to not feel like starving kurobuta dinner  4 5 it's basically grilled pork  the portion is so so so small it's about the size of a women's fist  for $21 i don't think it's worth it even though it's pretty tasty staff  5 5 very friendly and helpful while answering questions and keeps coming to ask whether we need anything i would definitely come back for their lunch special  maybe i will try some more of their dinner menu but i think their dinner is overpriced 
this is probably one of the fanciest restaurants in flushing  if you're looking to impress a date  i'd come here  the prices are similar to that of the city  but there's no wait to be seated  the food is good  but it's nothing out of the extraordinary  i would recommend getting the ribeye with bone marrow if you're looking to experiment  it was juicy and fatty with a butter like consistency!
everything is yum  we ordered $120 omakase that each fish piece is so fresh  the grilled meat platter is good amount and tasty 
ordered 5 bento boxes for our company's lunch today and got one for free! very satisfied and  they tasted sooooo good! this is the first time trying their lunch bento box but already visited them many times for dinner  the dinner menu is even better  def  the best choice for me and friends when craving for japanese cuisine 
food was great  staff was exceptionally nice  overall we really enjoyed ourselves   would def come back  note  they hadn't gotten their liquor license yet  so byob    store down the block bought a bottle of saki    sweet 
walked in because one of my friends wanted to eat japanese food  while we were debating which restaurant to go we wanted to give this place a try  we all had their omakase  was a little bit expensive in flushing but compare to the ones in manhattan the food was definitely worth the price  the restaurant looked small but it was actually not that small  it was next to dolar hot pot and congee village  to be honest  non of us were expecting too much but surprisingly  the food was very good  i really liked the wagy  they were so so so good  the wagy was definitely the must have  all of the other dishes were good  this place is great for dates and special occasions 
was looking for late night snack and ran across this place and lucky for me i hit a gem this place has the freshest seafood and crazy tender ribeye and bone marrow and let's not even mention the buttery wagu beef!!so good everything!!
service was good  the food was not the seafood platter was very salty  use cheap ingredients  not worth the price  the dancing eel roll was ok  nothing really special  the sear salmon was very bland  i only taste the yellow radish inside  overall very expensive for what we had  our bill was $175 for two people  we are not planning to go back to this place again 
let me start with their level of service  it's top notch  my wife  who is of darker persuasion who have experienced inequitable service in the past  was at the place before i did  the staff at robata treated her warmly  and continued to do so until we left  she's happy  i'm happy  food wise  it's of very high quality at a very reasonable price  their grilled appetizers are top notch  and their raw stuff are very fresh  speaking of raw fish  one of the main determinant in terms of how good is a japanese restaurant is its sashimi  and the sashimi's here are ultra fresh  as one can really tell just by their texture  this place will definitely become our regular  we know we'd get a product that is comparable to high end manhattan  without having to pay manhattan prices 
the foods were okay  however the waiting time was too long  their sushi suppose to be good  however the rice was too hard  we waited forever for the bbq foods  and the management of the restaurant wasn't that good  because the orders are such a mess  the waitress didn't even know which order for which table 
robata offers amazing price and selections for their lunch premium bento  six sets to choose for only $12 95 from 12 3pm daily  you can taste the freshness of the sashimi and immediately you will know that it's of top quality fish  i think their bento box is so much better and unique when compared to manhattan  even the presentation deserves compliments  their staff is attentive  friendly and service are great  their restaurant has a cozy ambiance which is great for family parties and office gatherings  i will definitely keep coming back as their dinner menu is equally intriguing and exciting!
so pleasantly surprised to discover this hidden gem in flushing  of all places!   the very fact they're constantly introducing specials which are pretty unique(foie gras uni toast; beef tendons yakitori  etc) and updating their sake selections literally thrills and excite me!!   not to mention their ridiculously super value added bento boxes during lunchtime   hope they'll attract all the right demographic type of customers like me who's always looking for something new  unique and tasty with not so much regards to price costs   and stay in business for as long as possible   good job  robata!!!
found this place last minute with my girl  went to dinner here for her birthday and it was fantastic! staff was great drinks were amazing and the food was exceptional!! definately a must go to!!! you will not be disappointed!!!
great atmosphere!  fresh sushi!  nice chef!  great services! reasonable price!   love this place 
what an unexpected surprise! drove down to lga only to find out my flight was delayed for at least 4 hours   so what do we do? explore queens of course   first stop in flushing  what an awesome neighborhood and this restaurant was tucked so neatly into a corner that we almost missed it! thanks to all previous yelpers for taking the time out to review this gem   that's how we found out about it  had to try some robata and some sushi   i wasn't a fan of the tamago (juno in chicago spoiled me with their homemade soufflé like egg) but the unagi  hamachi  sake and the delicious tuna tartare saved the day   wish i had ordered more fish so i could have a fabulous display of food like my fellow diners!husband had the ribeye with the bone marrow   yes the size of that dish caused a major jaw drop (see pic)   slather it all on a piece of that garlicky toast and you are in heaven! cannot wait to return and try some more goodies!
this is really excellent food all sushi and sashimi is really fresh compare with other sushi restaurants in flushing  the kitchen food also have a lot different type! highly recommended!
the service  menu selection and food quality are all above average and decent   after trying their omakase & regular table dining  i was pleased  but not impressed   there isn't one item that would give me the craving to go back again  unfortunately   overall  it is still a decent japanese restaurant in downtown flushing 
i came here with my family on a saturday  we ordered a kani salad  dragon roll  sashimi combo  and grilled meat kebab combo  this was a lot of food for 4 people  the service was good  the food was fresh and delicious  definitely worth the try!
great restaurant  delicious food and nice presentation   staffs are very polite   owner kenny makes good suggestion on food 
great new japanese place in flushing main st area   i'd say the best i've tried in the area  super fresh sushi with high attention to detail amongst both the chefs and wait staff  prices are decent  especially for their lunch specials  extra points for  (a) presentation   beautifully presented sashimi on a bed of shaved ice (wish i took photos)! (b) super well trained staff  great place for a casual hangout or a date spot  it's new  so still relatively quiet and unknown  but i suspect in a few months it'll be a popular sushi destination in the flushing area  i wanted to try their prime rib (and bone marrow) but they had sold out the night before  coming back to try that later as always  the bathroom was very clean  meaning the kitchen is clean too!overall  thumbs up  check it out 
this was probably the best sushi meal i've had in a long time   the service was spectacular  the quality of the food was really good  and the price was extremely reasonable for new york    we ordered the sushi and sashimi platter for two   i can certainly eat a ton of sushi and this was plenty for two of us  if you are in the area i highly recommend this place 
i came here yesterday during my lunch break and i tried the black cod robata grill  holy cow the black cod is the ****!!! so good that i actually came back to the restaurant after work for dinner to get myself a second helping along with stir fried noodles and other stuff  this place is perfect to go with friends or alone! (i went alone with my mac since i had to do work during lunch and it was still a wonderful experience) service was exceptionally great and kept me amused and entertained the whole time since i was by myself! (i just moved to nyc two weeks ago and i think i found my go to spot)
wow! everything was taste good and fresh  they had a great food presentation  atmosphere was awsome too  price is little higher but its worthy if you looking for good quality of fish  try it  you won't regret  )
we enjoyed this restaurant overall  the grilled meat platter a was excellent  the lamb and pork belly were my personal favorites  everything on the platter was good  we also tried many different items  the bone marrow was ok not but as good as other places but the prime ribeye that it came with was amazing  tuna pizza and robata crab roll were both very good  regular rolls selection were limited and ok  wish i could give it 3 5 stars  service was great and very attentive so that's why i gave it a higher rating 
everything we ordered was amazing  the sashimi was super fresh  the service was great as well! one downside is that they are pretty pricey  we ordered a " jumbo oyster" off their special menu  and it was $24  for one oyster     it tasted great! but just too expensive for flushing standard 
everything here was about delicious!the service was impeccable and our server always  made sure to explain each dish in careful detail the sashimi and sushi is must try  overall great experience    would love to come back!!highly recommend!
came here friday night for dinner  place looks nice and clean  took us a while to look over the menu and pick what we wanted  the server came up to us every few minutes to ask if we were ready 5 or 6 times while we were still deciding  we got the corn for an appetizer  it was very deliciously seasoned  but seemed like it had been cooked and just left there for 15 minutes  would've been amazing it if was hot off the grill  2 5 5we also got the sushi platter and the dancing eel roll  both were good  i appreciated actually being able to taste the eel  sushi platter had a variety of fish  chosen by the chef  4 5 the last thing we got was the rib eye steak with bone marrow  the sauce that it came with was very good  we got the steak medium and it came out medium rare  the meat tasted good though  it came with a little bowl of rice as well  i've never had bone marrow before and it was interesting to try  4 5overall food was good and i would try it once for the price  probably wouldn't go there again but it's a nice date night spot in flushing 
went there for dinner with wife  wow what happened to the chef's knife? yellow tail sashimi all in different shape and sizes  one piece is 3x thinker than the other  one piece is round and and one piece is square! i hope they didn't put some left over together to make me a plate  i mean if this is a sushi buffet i understand but this is somewhat a higher class japanese restaurant  sashimi is all about how chef controls the thinkness of certain fish to achieve the best texture  i did mention to the waitress very nicely  she said "ok"!
really enjoyed our meal here  server is very friendly and attentive  food was amazing  black cod is a must try! kobe beef sushi was wonderful and omg don't get me started on the bone marrow  this place is definitely on the higher price range but you get what you paid for in my opinion  not a huge sashimi person so i'm not sure on the scale of freshness  which number this place will land on  my boyfriend said it's great tho so i'll take his words for it  overall  loved every dish we ordered  give it a go and see for yourself before it gets too popular lol
excellent sushi  good service  great decor and music  everything was just right  would come back 
this is my first time at this restaurant   after just ate at another sushi restaurant next to hyatt hotel last week  i didn't have any high expectation; honestly  no expectation at all  but to my surprise  the sashimi there were so fresh and the sushi rolls were so tasty 
best hidden gem in flushing  the food and the service were excellent  the sashimi quality is fresh  i highly recommend the rib eye  (it comes with a bone marrow)  a++ ; will come here again!
the space is a lot smaller than i thought   the sushi is 3 5 to 4   the steak and bone marrow is at best 3  and the combo seafood platter is awesome looking but nothing worth the 110 dollars price tag  considering they gave you very little king crab and skinny snow crab for that price  service was great but no wet nap is offered however  it is over hyped a little i believe  will give it another try later 
came here with a party of 5 on a friday and left full and satisfied  finally found a place in flushing that serves japanese style skewers that i don't have to drive to city for  their sashimi appetizers are very tasty as well  especially their scallop top with toro and caviar  we ordered the robota seafood combo and wanted to order the meat combo as well but good thing we didn't cause the seafood combo was more then enough food for 5 people  the waiters are very attentive  kind and helpful  i will definitely return to try the meat combo next time 
it's a new restaurant in flushing with nice decor and friendly staff the sashimi was too cold  not defrosted completely the "sauce" is tooooo sweet on the bbq items   
i've been here twice  this has to be the freshest sushi available in flushing  both times  i've gotten the sashimi platter for two  it's plenty of food and we actually struggled to finish it  the second time  they added a certain fish to our meal because it was in season so that was pretty nice of them  they were kind enough to put the fish we couldn't eat on top of a batch of ice to keep it fresh as well  if i am ever in flushing and craving sushi  i'll definitely come back here !
living in flushing my whole life   so grateful for the asian invasion  this is def a come to sushi  place9
not many people on a tuesday night but the sushi and sashimi was righteous  service was great  the price could've been cheaper but the fish was fresh  i am tongue tied i do not have anything negative to say lol 
presentation was incredible!  space for large table is limited  would recommend for reservation for large parties  the foods were delicious and fresh  we ordered the deluxe meat combo and the sushi and sashimi combo  price was a bit on the higher end but decent  would visit again to try the deluxe seafood combo
we order the meat set and the pork belly was amazing! it was tender and juicy  the waiter was really nice  we were being savages and asking for three plates of edamame    he was cool about it though! food overall was good 
can i tell you all about robata in flushing? in a busy chinese and korean filled community  there's always a hidden gem waiting to be discovered  robata is one of those places my coworker is actually the wife of one of the partners  and she took us to lunch here  after just the initial visit  i was hooked  it's hidden in the corner of prince street  right upstairs from congee village  the restaurant is spacious and clean  so that's a plus  we ordered very reasonably priced lunch specials all around  i think i got some sort of skewer lunch  and was happy with it  this was the start of me trying to find an excuse to come back for dinner!so last friday was the night i was finally able to make a second visit  this visit was more memorable since we weren't pressed for a one hour time limit (working lunch hour)  from start to finish  the service was on point  i don't know the name of our server  but he was very attentive  and did ask if we were ready to order every few minutes or so  we decided to go with a side of bacon wrapped scallops and the skewer dinner combination for two  honestly  we weren't sure if we would be too full from the dinner combination  but my fiance was intent on having scallops that night  the combination came with lamb skewers  pork belly  chicken wings  beef  bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms  two riceballs  a skewer of salted asparagus  and one corn on the cob  i have to tell you  i was so impressed with the presentation and the attention that our server gave while describing our meal to us! everything on this platter was amazing  they even gave us complimentary yellowtail ragoon!when we realized that we still had a second stomach for dessert  the server brought us the menu and proceeded to describe each dessert to me  as soon as he said  "green tea tiramisu"  we were both sold  we had to have it  it was the most lightest  softest  mousse like cake with a hint of green tea  and the freshest berries decorating the plate all around  i even got to try a gooseberry  "everything is edible " he said  you don't have to tell me twice to eat everything off that plate!all in all  everything was amazing and on point  if you're tired of the hustle and bustle of the food courts  and same old chinese and korean cuisine  then go to robata  it's something different that you'll never forget 
i have yet  been to the restaurant  but have ordered their food through flushingfood com  i have ordered a handful of times  and i am not commenting on the delivery or the service  just the food itself    and the food is outstanding today i ordered the lunch bento box  and for that price  you will get an abundance of food  the food itself is tasty and fresh  i also have had the sushi and sashimi before  and it was very fresh  one can tell by the texture of the sashimi i will eventually visit the restaurant as i want to try the bone marrow  however  i doubt anyone will show displeasure with the food you won't regret a trip here 
best weekend lunch special i had! with only $12 95 you get bbq sashimi fried squid salad with egg and fruit  strongly recommended!!!
got the meat lovers entree as well as the eel roll  i highly recommend the eel roll they sear the top of it so it has a smoky flavor  go try it!
i went with some friends on valentine's day and the service was pretty slow  they have one guy (who might be the manager) attending the bar and also attending walk in customers and phone calls  he gave us water and took our drink order  then he started attending other customers and forgot our drinks  it took another 10 minutes or so before someone else noticed that we were waiting to order  the food was average for sushi  since this is a combined sushi  oyster  and steak restaurant  there's not a huge selection of sushi rolls  it's a bit pricey for the average tasting food  probably won't return  really recommend they hire more people to improve the service 
excellent attentive service  amazing fresh sushi and sashimi dishes  can't go wrong with the specialty rolls or tuna tartar  nice environment 
thought the food was pretty good and price was fair  the quality was pretty awesome too  however  when we were there  the restaurant was really empty and it was almost inexplicable  normally  you see an restaurant that's empty during lunch hours on a weekend  it raises a huge red flag (we didn't leave because we didn't realize how empty it was until we were seated)  anyhow  the food was good  prices weren't out of the ordinary for quality japanese food  the fact that it was so empty and it made the dining experience feel slightly weird  the staff was friendly  so that's always a huge plus  i just think this place needs some marketing since the food is good  price is good  staff is good  good luck and hope to try you soon again ahem  that 3 star is really for the lack of atmosphere
excellent sushi and grill food  waiter and staffs were very attentive and accommodating  sushi was very fresh and amazing as well as the grill japanese squid  if you are in the area  remember to check this place out decent japanese food at reasonable price 
this was such a disappointing experience   since it was a birthday celebration  we went all out on ordering some of the best things on the menu  we ordered 3 pcs of king salmon  3 pcs regular salmon and 3 pcs of otoro  where was the king salmon?!  it was so obvious they gave us all regular salmon but charged us the price of king! otoro was worse!  it was so thin and had a really fishy taste to it!  the bbq platter was presented very nicely  but the meat was cold and chewy when i bit into it! it didn't taste like it was freshly cooked  i wondered if they just gave us somebody else's canceled order    the sauce was also too sweet  sorry guys  we make better bbq at home!  i will definitely not come back!
this place rocks  very comfortable  staff (janice is great server) went out of their way to make sure everything was ok and all of them were so friendly  they have some really great lunch specials  i'll be back again 
this place has great sashimi   it always tastes fresh and each piece of fish has its own unique taste and texture which shows the high quality of the fish 
awesome freshness and quality of service  small portions by its the clear example of how quantity doesn't get along with quality  worth the trip to get there from lic
the meat was delicious  sushi was fresh but not so yummy with the ramen  the waiter  timothy was great! he was super friendly and attentive! wine was great but wine is always great  haha i would recommend this restaurant 
here from los angeles and decided to hit some sushi  they are amazing here the welcome  the service   and the food are awesome  many times i express my order to not give me avocados because i am allergic  and at least 70% of the time it comes out with avocados  not here  they made an amazing tuna awesome roll (which was awesome) and the sashimi platter was great for the price (there was one fishy tasting fish but for the $28 price tag  with a generous helping of the other fish it was super worth it  yum!  thank you our awesome waitress and waiter for the great meal tonight!  made our trip to nyc more enjoyable!
really good place to come if your feeling for some sushi  the ribeye and bone marrow was really delicious  the staffs was really friendly and nice  will definitely come back again 
we came in as a group of 4 to give this new restaurant a try  i've tried robata at other places before and was hoping for a good place in flushing we ordered 2 of the robata sets and a sashimi for 2  the food was very good   no complaints about the robata or sashimi  service was also very attentive and friendly good start! i'd recommend give them a try!
overpriced combo that is not worth to spend a lot money with little food ! not recommended!
i would highly recommend this new place for dinner   the sushi is fresh and they have excellent non sushi entrees  the lamb chops were delicious  also try the tuna salmon tartare dish the food presentation is top notch and the waitstaff is very attentive and courteous definitely give it a try 
i would highly recommend robata  the food was excellent and we were accommodated the entire time  it was an absolute pleasure 
come here for their lunch specials  great value pack at affordable 12 13 dollar range per person  fresh quality and good variety of combinations  lunch specials are offered 7 days a week! a must go! i rarely write reviews but this is a place i have been to 5+ times and still recommend ppl go!
i was in flushing last saturday and i was looking for sushi  i tried this place and i was really happy about it! i was at the bar  i tried the drink with tequila and pineapple  delicious  i also had tuna tartare  tuna pizza and scallops with bacon  everything was great and the service excellent! i will be back for sure 
disappointing  the salmon sashimi was pretty good  the wings were subpar  i was really excited for the rolls  but they replaced the seaweed with lettuce  that was a big no no for me 
this place knows how to treat a person great  between the good food and the great service i got they deserve 6 stars  i had the spicy ramen 
i came here on a saturday night with a friend and was expecting this place to be packed but was a little surprise that it wasn't as busy  the food was amazing  my friend and i got the bone marrow wangu beef and dancing eel roll to share  they also give edamame as a free appetizer   overall it was great and very reasonably priced for new york  i would definitely go back 
grill food  sushimi and sushi was ok  nothing special   it's on the expensive side considering the quality is not top in the city   service was very good though 
definitely recommend this place if you are looking for best seafood place to eat   they serve the best freshest seafood   
it is the most ridiculous restaurant ever  people got ripped off by the price yet not getting what is derserved  their food is defintley not worth the price 
to be honest  i don't even like salad but the salad they make here was better than i expected  i've been here a few times already and it's now the only place i order from when i'm in the mood for some salad  most of the salads on the menu are $8 9 before tax  but you can also customize your own salad with whatever they have starting from $7  i like the avocado veggie salad w  creamy sesame dressing so that's what i usually end up getting  they make the salads to order and it usually takes them around ~10 mins  keep in mind the wait time is going to be longer if you want grilled steak on your salad or something  either way  i recommend calling in the order if you know what you want and don't like waiting  especially since you'll likely just be standing around since the mall building removed all the benches they had there a while ago for whatever reason 
i yelped for a salad place in flushing (which barely exists) and this place came up! i've been coming here for a couple of weeks consecutively  i'm scared of trying new places and seems odd to finally have a salad place in flushing but i tried it anyways verdict? i love this place! their salads and hot herbal jelly have been my go to orders here and no regrets  lately it has been a long wait but i don't mind knowing they are making everything freshly on the spot  the workers are also always working swiftly and nonstop so i have respect for that  i usually call ahead of time to order so i give them some time to make it and by the time i get there  i can pick up or wait awhile until it is done  i usually don't like to wait because i am always on the go but if i want quality  nicely presented salads  i go here  the workers are also really nice and care about your orders  love the fact they have kale (big fan)so thank goodness for finally having a great salad place in flushing! (it's about time!)
i was looking for a salad spot and leaf garden always popped up on yelp  i decided to give it a try  they have tons of options to choose from  i decided to "make your own salad"  i ordered organic spring mix  cherry tomato  red onion  carrots  cucumbers and cage free chicken  i wanted to try a different type of dressing since i feel like i always chose the same old italian  or oil & vinegar  so my choice of dressing was lemon parsley w olive oil  i also added avocado too for additional charge  since salads already come with the avocado but since i chose "make your own salad" the avocado was an additional charge  the salad was very good  it was good decent portion  overall it was delicious but the only thing that bothered me was that they forgot to add the avocados  i paid extra for the avocado and once i got home there was no avocado to be found  (i should of checked before leaving)
if i want a freshly made green juice i get it here   it's $5 for a medium which is cheaper than manhattan   very nice selection of veg and or fruit juices   healthy  delicious  and refreshing   i'll try their salads in the future which other reviewers like   the counter people are nice 
i'm a big fan of their herbal jelly dessert! it's so good!!! i usually get sago  mochi  and sweet potatoes as my toppings  the herbal jelly works so well with condense milk and when you mix all the toppings together it's even better! their mochi isn't hard or too chewy  sometimes i add two orders of it hehhehe food does take longer for them to make since they operate in a small kiosk  i would call to order ahead if your time sensitive they also serve a bunch of salads and fresh juices! i've ordered the mean green drink  personally i'm not a fan  i've had plenty of green juices that had a variety of robust fiber dense vegetables but it still had a great taste  theirs was for sure healthy but not very tasty  from seeing yelp pics  i really want to try some of their salads next time i come!
got the customized salmon salad and jamaica sunshine smoothie the second time and it did not disappoint! jamaica sunshine has orange  papaya and carrot  i actually got confused and thought this would be juice but it came as a smoothie  fine with me cause it was still so delicious! no sugar added  the lady was so kind to give me the leftovers from the blender too  and it was only $5! salmon salad was good but wasn't anything i can't make  i love that the salmon was baked in their mini oven and comes hot on top of your salad  my only complaint is that they didn't give me a good piece of salmon and i kind of noticed they didn't for someone else too  it was still delicious  also they don't chop their salads which makes it difficult for me to eat without making a mess  really good lunch after my workout  i can't wait to come back again but i would probably skip the salads next time 
100% fresh ingredients chopped and diced right in front of you  salad ranges about $10 after tax which is a little pricy for this particular location considering the fact that it is competing with city prices  juices are $5 which is very reasonable and the sizing is generous  they also have the iconic taiwanese grass jelly herbal dessert made with taro sweet potato glutinous balls and other traditional sides such as red bean and tapioca  again  everything is super fresh and the employees here are lovely  p s there are no seating in doors but you can find a bench or two where you can sit close by and munch on!
came here today & got the " jamaica sunshine " juice  i couldn't believe there was no added sugar in it  it's delicious! i most definitely recommend this place to anyone who's in flushing looking for freshly squeezed juices & a great variety of themalso  ) will definitely try one of their salads my next time around!
got me a healthy lunch today to make sure i shit all the bad stuff out  ya know? thoughts  i ordered the healthy hearty chicken salad w  balsamic vinaigrette for $8 + tax  it was fresh and tasted delish  but dayum  eating healthy is expensive
my visit to leaf garden was solid  every aspect of my time there was awesome except for the portion sizes that this business isn't generous with  unfortunately  since i'm a vegetarian  i felt glad that this spot offered those options like the shrimp and avocado wrap ($5)  i also ordered a hot earl grey tea to soothe my sore throat  and the server was willing to put cold water in it to make the drink warm (props to her)  the portion size of the wrap was disappointing  since i finished it in three bites  on the menu  this is listed as an entree but it's more of an appetizer  since leaf garden is situated inside a mall  there isn't seating available specific to lg customers  but there are benches throughout the building that you can sit at  leaf garden is one of those one hit wonder types of places for me  i enjoyed experiencing its food during my first time there  but i don't plan on going back 
surprisingly good! i ordered the shrimp salad and hot herb jelly (with tapioca  sago  red beans) to go  flavor profile  freshness  everything was on point  i really liked the house sauce that came with it  actually it was the highlight of the salad but the reason why a star is taken off is because of the portion  i usually never finish my meals  but for this  i finished everything and still felt hungry  the portion itself is enough for a light meal but not a real entree  i also originally wanted to order the bowl (it was on the menu) but they said they didn't serve that because they don't have anything with rice  then i opted for the steak salad but they said they also don't have steak at the moment  so i ended up with a shrimp salad which wasn't my first choice at all  and i'm also a big bubble tea fan because i love tapioca  but the tapioca on the herb jelly was not good  it was edible but not what i would call good tapioca  it had no flavor  it clumped together  and stuck to your teeth  i'd advise to opt for another topping 
it's rare to find a salad place in flushing  i came here for the hot herbal jelly dessert  i added sweet potatoes  mochi and red bean  it came with a side of condensed milk  there is ice beneath the herbal jelly  it's a very good dessert for the summer  it is a bit small for $6    looks big but the container doesn't hold much  we also ordered a watermelon slush  which tasted more like watermelon juice  the ladies that work there were very kind ~
pleasantly surprised  the salad was fresh and absolutely delicious  we both had the cage free chicken and avocado with creamy sesame dressing  we also tried the avocado toast  a fresh juice and the herbal jelly  the herbal jelly was first for me and i loved it  everything was a super win! can't wait to try the rest of their salads!
pros  1  their menu is very health conscious yet delicious  which can be difficult to find in the main st flushing area  their servings were also bigger than i expected  2  there's a lot of variety! they have different salads  smoothies  poke bowls  and even dessert  all are delicious  and reasonably priced!cons 1  the food takes forever  i came here twice  and each time was a 15 to 20 minute wait  it does depend on what you order  i got a salad with pasta  and i saw them boil the pasta fresh after i ordered  horrible if you're on a tight schedule  2  there's no designated seating area to eat the food  so you will probably have to take it to go 
i ordered the sweet green and it was fresh and delicious! it's a kiosk inside the mall but right near the entrance if you want to grab a quick juice  the lady was friendly and quick and served me right away  there was no line but i was waiting for a meeting to start so hung by the benches  few people during this time popped in and out grabbing juices  place looked clean and would def go there again if i'm by that area in flushing 
the salad was $8  they don't have seats but the salad was better than prince tea house's salad  the herbal jelly dessert was $6 for shaved ice and $5 for hot jelly  it comes with 3 toppings of your choice
i've only tried their juices which are great and well worth the price  the food seems a little expensive but for a good salad   it's worth it  there aren't a lot of healthy food options available in the area either  fruit and veggies always look fresh 
finally got to grab food here tonight  good thing a yelper had mentioned in her post the place is located inside arcadia mall  thanks girl! the building #s on this block is almost impossible to spot  but then again it could be that i wasn't wearing my glasses  anyways fellow yelpers  if u don't wanna look like a tourist scanning each building for this place  the mall is right next to bank of china at the corner of main st & franklin ave  this place is a hidden gem! lady at the counter is super nice  she speaks english  cantonese & mandarin  the food is made w fresh ingredients & prepared right before ur eyes  no shady behind some high counter i don't know if u dropped my food on the floor kind of nonsense  ordered the blt chopped salad  grilled wild salmon salad  blt panini  shrimp wrap & a mean green juice  the salmon was cooked perfectly! everything was delicious  crisp  clean & oh so healthy  i feel like i should balance this meal out by gnawing on a slab of pork belly i wish they do well & open a 2nd location in brooklyn  service  100%food  100%price  100% affordablecounter lady's grandson  100% cute
located in arcadia mall a few blocks down on main st   leaf garden is an oasis amid the local chinese and middle eastern joints  the impeccably clean and open layout was a pleasant surprise  i ordered a $6 chicken panini with cage free (!) chicken  egg  avocado  tomato  lettuce  and honey mustard  while not an out of this world sandwich  i thought it represented leaf garden well   simple  healthy  and unpretentious  everything on the menu was very reasonably priced and i will be back to try one of their fresh smoothies  let's give them our support! i'd hate for such a rare gem to close down due to lack of business 
i could eat here everyday if i can~just wish they had open at a place with seating  (
i love this place! i've been looking for a place like this  it's perfect for people who is trying watch their weight  so healthy and fresh  i love all the options that i could choose for my salad  it's a plus they sell freshly squeeze juices 
we bought the shaved ice with 3 toppings  but we had to wait for more than 15mins   most importantly  the shaved ice was melted and became watery!  very little toppings in it   i felt like i was drinking water!  the funny thing is  when we pointed it out  the owner (i think she is) said it tastes better watery   what??  don't bullshit me like that 
this place is literally the best place for high quality and organic food in the neighborhood  i'm in love with their veggie juice  they use the same organic kale spinach that i used to buy from whole foods  how do i know? they open the bag right in front of me  i support this place and i support health clean high quality food  because you are what you eat!!!
i hangout in flushing alot especially when i'm running errands  i stop in for a juice it was nice to get a fresh squeeze juice  i would definitely reccomend this place to anyone in the area its on main street
fresh squeezed juices at a great price  good sandwiches and wraps as well  there are some bench seating in the mall 
i love this place  sandwiches and salads and smoothies are all freshly made after u order and food taste good! staff is friendly! definitely will be coming often! this is my kind of food! i ordered the blt panini and milk tea  the sandwich was very delicious the bread was crispy  bacon was fried right in front of me and the tea was big for $2 50 and taste better than the bakery next door!
so happy there's finally somewhere you can get healthy salads from in flushing!!  love their hearty chicken salad   there's so many different ingredients in it and it's made fresh to order   their chicken wing+leg combo is pretty good as well   just make sure you have time to wait as it takes a while to cook in their mini toaster oven 
great everything! fresh organic ingredients  kind helpful attentive ownership  perfect for a quick salad or smoothie  great job
my first time ordering the salad and i'm so not satisfy with it  they didn't provide any dressing although i selected which dressing i wanted  so basically i ate a plain tasteless salad for $10  
definitely five stars! one of the few healthy and tasty choices in flushing  love their wraps 
this is what flushing has needed for a longggg time   there are many delicious chinese  korean and fast food options in flushing but not many healthy options   i know that many people who work or live around this area go to subway  or g and g deli for some healthy choices but find that those places are very limited   leaf garden serves fresh food at a good price and they deliver!!!!  this is my new "go to" for lunch 
the food is delicious and hearty and they have a cute seating area not to mention the staffs are very nice  very hospitable  very happy with this place 
healthy and delicious food which also has a small private sitting area  the staff is very friendly and helpful  they offer very good customer service  this is a good  place for healthy eats in flushing  which is rare 
went there and ordered a watermelon ice and it was delicious   for $2 00  they used all watermelon with no added sugar   it was really fresh   can't beat it   the salads and paninis look great too!  the place looks very fresh and is in middle of the arcadia mall   the mall has a number of big name chinese restaurants recognized in the new york times such as the dumpling galaxy  niu pot and coming soon  cin chinese   leaf garden's healthy choices are perfect alternatives to the establishments in the arcadia mall 
first time eating korean bbq so can't compare  susan  the owner was so helpful in guiding us through menu  everything was was tasty  they put so many sides on the table to accompany your meal  delicious!  they didn't rush us  reasonable prices  give it a try 
i came here on a saturday night with my wife to enjoy some real korean bbq  the staff was pretty awesome  seated us right away and gave us the menu  they made some recommendations and we placed our order  food came out pretty quick and they explained how everything is done at their restaurant  we enjoyed are dinner and look forward to coming back 
new  fresh  friendly and filling!  tucked into the main thoroughfare of korean eateries in this korean village called murray hill (replete with a train station and a triangle park)  solbaat is just the right size for a leisurely dinner and some chatting with the hostess who was very welcoming  the table array of small dishes was perfect  and included many gems they would replace happily when asked for  then  just before we left  the owner plied us with summer cold noodles just to show off another of their best dishes   what a treat  we'll be back!
tucked in the side street  149th pl and roosevelt  the staff is very helpful and kind  non of those irritable expressions when we asked them about their menu   the quality is excellent and the service is attentive and focused  price is reasonable   will definitely be back 
great spot for pork belly and drinks! it's probably more fun with a larger group  but we were just a table of 2 people and had a great time  service was awesome and the prices were really good  we spent about $60  including tip and tax  for 2 orders of pork belly  a bottle of soju  and a dish of rice cakes&dumplings  we arrived around 7pm on a friday night  but we were the first people to arrive  it seemed  this place is definitely more of a late night establishment but it was great going at 7  regardless  i would definitely be back 
korean bbq and the bumping edm made me to eat dance entire night  and why not? eating and clubbing are both excellent pastimes  actually the food is quite good here and the customer service was excellent  very pleasant and attentive staff  we had the grand opening special 2 orders of pork ribs +large clams for $45ish  the pork ribs were marinaded well (not too salty) and the large clams were fresh and juicy  everything grilled by an attendant  per usual  all tables comes with grilled corn on the side  steamed egg and a bowl of seasoned shredded scallions that pairs with the grilled meat  the seafood pancake had a  large meat dough ratio  but my favorite was the spicy chicken feet  the skin fell right off the bone they were so tender and the sauce was addictive  chairs opened to reveal a cubby  no more stinky smell after k bbq  ventilating hung directly above the grill  if you check in and give a review on yelp  free beer! it's open to 6am! perfect for post clubbing munchies 
my two friends and i were enticed by their $9 99 pork deal so we decided to give this place a try  we went a little after they opened so we were the second table there   so with their pork belly deal it is $9 99 per order (but you need to order two for the deal)  an order came with 2 slices of pork belly which is ok for $10 but looking at the menu  the actual price was $19 99  in addition to the pork belly we got the beef galbi ($29 99)  the servers cook everything and cut the pieces for you so all you gotta do is eat  i never complain about this  but their chopsticks were kinda weird  like they were super bulky and hard to use  it's not just me  even my friends who were raised on chopsticks said they were hard to use   anyways  pork belly  was not bad  beef galbi was really really good  perfect texture  i preferred it over the pork belly  butbutbut the serving size was so small  there was literally only 15 small cube pieces  i counted  for $30  the thing was  i expected to be overstuffed with 2 orders of pork belly and 1 order of galbi  to be honest  that only make me even more hungry  so we decided to order tteokbokki and fried mandoo ($11 99) with cheese (extra $)  it came out looking like budae jigae  not sure if they heard understood us complaining but this could feed like 4 hungry people  the mandoo was deliciously crispy and the filling was amazing  the tteok however was too soft and like had no chew to it  there were also some fish cakes and after scooping it out to take it to go  we discovered some clear  flat noodles that was super chewy! long story short  good food  but very pricey for small amount of meat  considering the amount of other kbbq places in the area  i'd rather go elsewhere  i left feeling full from the order of tteokbokki mandoo not the meat    
new korean bbq spot near northern blvd right next to the murray hill lirr station! my friends and i came to check this place out earlier tonight  they currently have a special price on galbi for $19 99 order this week and will have pork belly next week for $9 99 order  since we wanted to take advantage of the special  we decided to get two orders of the galbi (note  there is a two order minimum on the grill)  the galbi is unique here in that it is served as cubes and therefore does not have any bones  we also ordered the budae jigae  the budae consisted of ham  kimchi  pork belly  tofu  ramen  enoki mushrooms  watercress  and cheese  i really enjoyed the dish although i did wish it had more tofu and perhaps some dukbokki (but no biggie)  complimentary side dishes brought out included steamed egg and a corn dish the place consists mainly of small circular tables which seat 3 4 people along with one or two larger rectangular tables towards the back  it's definitely a place to go to with a smaller group of friends  it has a cozy fun ambiance with lots of cute bottles lining the walls as decor def would come back to try more of their menu!
a little pricy but the food is quality  the marinated beef is hands down the best galbi we've had  why? its not sliced beef  it's cut cubed beef nicely marinated and extremely tender  we got the special order for $59 and chose the large clams  the clams were good sizes and fresh  the corn and egg were free the service is top notch  they were attentive and constantly cleaning up  my only disappointment was they don't offer more chan   side dishes like most korean bbq places  no rice  no green leaves  no additional sauces  but they had cold ice water!
i saw this place on yelp thought it would be good  i've been craving korean food for a long while  especially for budae jigae  came here with my bf on a saturday night   we ordered the seafood bbq and an order of thick cut pork belly  then 5 minutes later the waiter came to tell us that there was a minimum requirement of two items from the bbq meat section  which meant we cannot just order one order of pork belly   since it was impossible for two of us to finish that much food  we decided to just order the seafood bbq and a bowl of budae jigae  i totally understand that every restaurant is allowed to have their own rules regarding these minimum requirements  but at this point we already ordered a $34 seafood bbq plus it was not busy at all  the waiter could not give us an explanation when we asked him what was the difference   jump into the food part  first off  they did not offer any complimentary corn  i was looking forward to having those since they looked so good on yelp  super disappointed! the seafood platter was bland and tasteless  like dude  i could've done this at home  why did i spent $35 bucks when i could've bought the same things at bj's or whatever  plus  they only offered with two sauces that were both spicy  for the budae jigae  it was not fulfilling at all  it tasted like kimchi and whatever  the service was below average  we had to ask the waiter to continue grilling our food as he kept trying to tell us it was ready when it was clearly undercooked  and tbh  he looked a little impatient as we kept telling him that the food wasnt cooked i'm writing this review across the street at mapo because 149 pocha was very unfulfilling  it was a super disappointing experience  bad food  unknowledgeable staff  i will not come back again 
i lost my credit card  then i check the credit card statement  the last payment i have made was in here on christmas day  i immediately called the restaurant  that have it!!!!! thanks god! and thanks the waiter find my card  today is new year's eve  i come back again to pick my card  lucky me  and thanks a lot!!
just finished dinner today  it was pretty empty but it was easter sunday dinner so that was very understandable  between the two of us we had 2 servings of thick pork belly (samgyupsal) and one bottle of soju  the bill came out to be $32 33 (!!!) as they're doing a special at the moment (9 99 per serving of pork belly) food   great  the sides  spicy scallion salads  corn cheese  egg jjim  pork belly is grilled with garlic  onion  and kimchi  service   impeccable  the servers grilled for us  adjusted the fire at the perfect time  and were very attentive  the two servers working at the time were very extremely nice; they weren't intrusive by any means  and very polite in everything they did and said ambience   legitimate pocha style place  circular metal bbq tables and stools (stool tops open so you can store your belongings inside)  soju and beer bottles line the ledge on the walls  very clean restroom (albeit only one)  the tables are adequately far apart overall   definitely coming back again to have their shellfish bbq grill  casseroles  tangs 
had korean bbq at solbaat last night  had pork neck meat and pork belly bbq  table consensus voted for pork belly  chewy fat laden explosion of porky goodness   their ban chan spread was large  but more geared for adults  they served steamed eggs  which was requested again and they were happy to provide specials on the noodle was nice but wasn't something we'd do again  between the water noodle and spicy mixed noodle go with the spicy noodle lastly we ordered their kimchee jigae  which is a good litmus test  holy moly  it was good  spicy sour deep with generous helpings of pork meat had a nice conversation with the owners  couple from long island  who were passionate about their restaurant and food  passionate enough to open a korean bbq place next to so many others had two pork neck one pork belly two noodles (one water  one spicy mix) kimchee jigae one soju; hair over 100  not too bad net net  would go back again  order the pork belly and kimchee stew  service was good  after we got their attention    sometime you need to be a bit pushy to get what you need 
great service  great food  it was my first time here and it was a great experience the makchang is sooo good 
as i was coming back from some place on northern boulevard and walking past the rail road one night i noticed some loud music and a group of people outside of an establishment   now mind you this was well after midnight and a lot of places are usually closed except bars and in this case korean barbecue spots   i took a mental note as i had other plans that particular night   sometime later i found myself back in the flushing area after a long day and felt like having some barbecue but had not decided where  i was headed toward northern boulevard and again passed the railroad  it was very lively by that area and i remembered there was a place that had piqued my interest from the other night  my visit to 149 pocha was very unplanned and i was considering some of the other places nearby as they were open late as well  even though it was unplanned i am glad i decided to walk in   it is a very quaint korean barbecue establishment but can accommodate some large parties   i was greeted by a server and a polite lady at the door and was seated right away   the menu offerings have a nice offering of barbecue  seafood  stews and some specials   i ordered initially grilled marinated beef and some thinly sliced pork belly   for some reason they did not fire up the table grill and cooked everything in the kitchen  that was fine with me and everything came out cooked very well   the very nice hostess jean (not sure if this is the correct spelling)  recommended some soup to go with my meal and i was actually still hungry  the servers were very hardworking   formal and polite   they brought each dish out in a timely manner and made sure i had enough rice   since i was still hungry jean assisted me picking out a third dish   i wanted something along the lines of seafood but not a large dish   she recommended i take advantage of a marinated beef special that comes with spicy octopus    it was a solid recommendation as it was a dish i had not tried before   overall it was a very good first experience and special shout out to the lovely hostess ms jean who seems to know all the late night customers   usually when i eat solo servers are a bit standoffish with me and leave me alone  in this particular instance though ms jean took it upon herself to check up on me and make sure i was doing all right  it was a pleasant surprise to be treated so kindly even though it was my first time eating at that establishment  this is a spot that people would enjoy with their family  group of friends or if you wanted to dine alone  this is a lively spot that caters to those who enjoy eating and drinking late  there seemed to be a decent amount of food traffic that i noticed since i was seated facing the door   takeaways   hard working  polite staff  very late hours during the week (6am closing)  good selection of korean traditional dishes and barbecue  good for drinking and grilling meat with friends family or on your own   the establishment can accommodate large parties but is not as large as other places and there is usual some lively music playing on the television 
good service! the hostess was friendly and so were the waiters! they were super accommodating too! spot is pretty chill  music was good   they played an ultra music festival video!we came here on a weekday around 8pm  there were plenty of seats but it definitely started filling up around 9 30 10  food and prices are good! an order of the pork belly has a 2 order min   but it's definitely worth it  our favorite dish of the night  there's a free bottle of soju with a review   definitely an incentive 
good service  good tasting food   especially the pork belly  it's more of a bar scene so they don't have the extra dishes or lettuce to wrap the meats but the meat was very tender 
there is plenty of competition around this neighborhood so it's very very surprising that more of these bbq restaurants open  honestly there was nothing memorable about my experiences here besides the service  the portions were extremely small and expensive (for the size) and it came with such little bonchon  the mayo corn dish was finished after 5 scoops in comparison to the huge amount they give at mapo  from what i remember it was $19 for an order of pork belly (they don't grill it like samgyeopsal where it came with grilled kimchi bean sprouts) and $27 99 for the galbi  they currently have a special for the galbi for $59 you get 2 orders and an order of grilled octopus  though i don't eat octopus my friends said it seemed undercooked to them  all in all there are plenty of other options in this neighborhood  i don't think i'll be coming back 
my boyfriend and i were looking for somewhere to eat when we came across this place on yelp  we saw the deal where the pork was $9 99! we came around 5 30pm (they open at 5pm)  so it was pretty empty  but more people started to come in around 6pm there's also an offer where if you give them a rating on yelp facebook you can get a free bottle of soju (non flavored)  i got the chum churum which is said to be the lightest according to the hostess  they give corn on the side in a wooden metal bowl and steamed egg  we got two orders of pork belly and two bowls of rice  the pork belly was very flavorful  they also put kimchi on the grill which was also very good they said they'll be having different promotions every month  overall the food was good  as well as the service  it was a great deal and i will definitely come back!
we ordered a ton of food plus we were given a bunch of free dishes sides  the quality of the meat was good  the seafood udon stir fry was one of my favorite dishes of the night  it was a little pricy for the portion size  service was great!
my favorite to go place for some korean drinking foods and soju  the place ambiance is cozy and relaxed  good for small groups when craving for late night eats  service is friendly and welcoming  my favorites from here are the stir fry pork belly with kimchee  spicy cod fish soup and the seafood pot!
small korean bbq restaurant  good environment  tasty beef  good quality pork belly and good selection of beers   great place to hangout with friends  nothing fancy but something about it makes me want to go back   maybe because of the great host     =)   great place to go with small group of friends that will enjoy good quality meats and seafood    will definitely go back   give it a shot !!!!!
came in knowing we wouldn't understand the menu and were guided thru a meal of delicious proportions  high quality beef brisket  flavorful spoces  served digestive tea at the beginning and yogurt at the finish  worth driving to flushing for 
go to this place! there is nothing it cannot do well  from the ambiance to service to most importantly  the food  staff treat you well  all items on the menu are savory and so satisfying! as a patron of many korean houses in the area  let me tell you this place makes me wish i had never been to those other places in the past  i recommend specifically the casseroles  as they can feed an army (hence the name  i think)  anyhow just go there
we ordered the seafood  beef  and eel bbq for 4ppl  i love the seafood since it's fresh and juicy  and the eel and beef are not bad  they gave us 10% discount by paying cash  the price is reasonable (~$35+tax+tips for each ppl)  highly recommended!
there are so many korean bbq places in the area and ive been to almost all of them 4 5x over in my time living blocks away from the murray hill lirr  i had high expectations for this place because of the 4 5 star reviews on yelp but i was disappointed in many aspects of my dinner here  service  the waitress only showed up to our table twice the entire time we were there and it was pretty empty inside the restaurant too so it wasn't like she was busy tending to other tables besides ours  i couldnt get more water for about an hour and the other staff was either taking a smoke break or talking with each other  i was actually going to order more food but the fact that i was waiting for the waitress to check up on us for such a long time made me lose my appetite  food  there was barely anything served as side dishes with our order and the grilled corn was finished in 5 spoonfuls  it left alot to be desired when the pork belly we ordered as the grand opening special finally came out  i found that while the pork belly was cooking  the hot oil kept splashing onto my hands and face while i was trying to eat the rice cake    not pleasant whatsoever having hot oil burn your face as the pork belly kept cooking on a large flame  i cant speak on anything else there because i never got the opportunity to order it  i left hungry and unsatisfied with my dinner and it was a bummer because i really wanted to like this place  maybe i'll try it again  if the wait is too long at mapo or even ham ji bach   which are all located within a block distance from here 
came here with three other friends around 8 30pm on a weeknight  the place is not that big but they weren't busy so we were seated right away  we got two orders of the $9 99 pork belly special (min 2 orders per table)  each order comes with two strips of pork belly  the servers are really nice and helpful and of course they grill the meat for you  i just wish they gave us lettuce to wrap the meat in instead of only giving us this plate of seasoned scallion strips sorta thing  we were provided with free side dishes including kimchi  corn and steamed egg  they even brought us a second plate of corn when we finished our first  another dish we ordered was the tteok bokki with fried mandu $11 99  there were 4 fried dumplings in the dish  which were very good but the tteok bokki itself wasn't as chewy as the ones i've had at other places; slightly mushy tbh  they also have a deal where if you review them on yelp you can get a free bottle of soju but it's just regular soju  not flavored  overall  i think it's a decent place to drink with friends and get some kbbq or other korean food! for the four of us the bill came out to be $10 a person including tax and tip  we weren't super full though so i would say the portions are just okay  not extremely filling  then again for the amount we paid  it was reasonable 
i have been craving korean bbq for the longest and came across this yummy restaurant! thank god! this will be my new hotspot for korean bbq bc it's sooo good  unlimited side dishes and the soup were delicious  the bbq was really delicious  all the workers are friendly! & im excited to come back with my other friends!
the waiter and waitress were great  very friendly  my friend and i got an order of gobchang (intestines) and an order of pork belly  they have a two order minimum but you can mix the meat choices  the gobchang was nice and crispy and cooked separately before being brought out  the pork belly was delicious but you can't go wrong with pork belly    they had a nice onion salad that you ate with everything  the mussel soup they gave for free was sooooo bland  didn't enjoy that at all  my friend was still hungry so we got an order of the tofu spicy pork dish  omg what a mistake    that was horrible    i felt bad for the table near us that wanted to order it because they saw it on our table    wanted to warn them    goo gong tan is a few doors down    they have amazing complimentary dishes they give and their food is so much tastier    not sure i can go back to saw maeul   
awesome place!!!! open til 6am  good for drinks and korean bbq  must try marinated pork spareribs  plus when you order their special promotion entree  you get either free nakji bokkeum or big clams service is very friendly  they greet customers at the doors  also  very attentive lady host  she recommends specials and drinks throughout service 
such a dope korean bbq restaurant  authentic to the pocha style of korean bbq  we got two orders of pork belly for two  great side dishes  great drinks and great atmosphere  highly recommend for smaller groups  service is awesome  enjoy!
excellent place    they have gelbi on special for $19 99   the portions are big  comes with a lot of side dishes too
so what makes a great "pocha"? great food & soju!!! the new owners kevin and jean(siblings i am told) have done a great job turning this place into one of the best pocha places around  totally revamped menus with a new talented chef on board  all bbqs are on point  and the portion is generous  you gotta try the assorted pancake (modeum jeon)  so delicious!!!friendly staffs & great music  the crowd is mostly 20s to 30s  a must try if you are in the area  it's located right next to lirr murray hill station  so making a trip from nyc is also convenient 
the galbi was awesome  must drink  apple soju with it   the host  jean is awesome and personable   must try place!
i had an amazing night  maybe too much fun  lol my friends been telling me about this new grand opening place they been hanging out and of course i had to check it out for myself & loved it!!! my break downs~1  great vibes and awesome music  2  all the employees are soo friendly  quick  and welcoming  almost made me feel like they were my friends haha3  the food wowed me  it was so delicious!!! korean bbq   seafood    ribs    spicy pork     so many choices    oh my  yummy food  happy me 4  i loved the fact that there were free street parking around the area  it took me less than 5 mins to find parking  i had to take uber back home  5  i really enjoy their korean wine   they have different choices & beers  i tried few korean wine and it was so delicious  love trying new things! overall  i was pretty impressed how excellent their customer service  food & atmosphere was  definitely coming back!!! thank you for your great service p s  i forgot to take all the food porn photos  that's how much fun i was having  thanks again!
absolutely delicious korean bbq  excellent and friendly service  highly recommended 
i was enjoying my night out at black hole cafe and got hungry  wanted to grab a quick bite to eat  so i went right next door  the marinated pork bbq was better than the entertainment in black hole  daeji kalbi was even better  had the joe gaetang soup which complimented the protein  wish i ate there first before going next door  i'm sure with the delicious food in my tummy i would've had a better time there  and i got laid  
staff is so attentive & nice   ordered the marinated beef  large clams  & pork belly   food was delicious  cozy place && they had ultra music festival playing
went here for the first time with friends and we ordered 3x pork belly and the duck bbq that came with grilled octopus which was a nice addition  the service was good and the waiters were attentive to our needs  i would most likely come here again with people the only thing i would say is a negative is that if you have a party of 4 or more  the tables are a bit cramped and you'll probs have too much side dishes and overall  dishes for the table to hold  we used an extra stool to hold overflow dishes  also  keep your metal cups away from the flame  like at least 3 inches; my friend burned her fingers on her cup even though it wasn't near direct flame 
we ordered the special which gives either clams or octopus for free  it was a good amount with alot of taste  not as much in terms of amount though 
this place is a must go korean restaurant around the town  they have special noodle called mill myun which no other restaurant in nyc have in their menu  the dish is similar to cold buckwheat noodle but with different noodle  also  their authentic pork bbq is very tasty and mouthwatering  their price is very reasonable with so many side dishes that comes out for free!! the parking can be a little hectic at times but there are plenty of street parkings during lunch hours 
come here with friends  nice environment and it looks good when they turn the fire up  nice place! strongly recommend pork  beef and seafood 
good service i love the joomoolruk there ~ i'm definitely coming back for more i always come here in the weekends with bunch of friends and the owner is so friendly and the staff always take good care of me i love it here
delicious food  upbeat atmosphere  nice ambiance and fantastic service  i love the kalbi  chajae  chicken wings are yummy  chicken and cheese was not too spicy and just the way i like it  good place to hang out with friends and enjoy a good meal 
we came here after our massages and this is the most authentic korean bbq spot ive been to  i grew up in flushing and have been eating in the neighborhood ever since  and this spot is definitely  worth coming to again  the side plates you get here are the best  you get a whole mackerel (fish) along with two soups along with many more  their dumplings are handmade  you can tell  that bean paste soup was my favorite! the meat was amazing quality and for all that you get you will be walking out happy  the owner is very knowledgable about the menu and helpful for beginners  all the staff were cute! i couldve hugged them all ! after our meal we got the asian milk drink i grew up on! yay
so ugly food we can not eat  and then manager didn't say anything  the seafood is uncooked but they said is already done  we didn't eat anything and i paid 83 dollar  no tips  i will not go there anymore 
great place  food is delicious and service is spectacular! definitely recommend and will be coming again 
first time here for my bday  good foods  good vibe and a young crowd  will definitely come back 
great food  in a location where korean barbecue is on every street this place stands out in both quality and atmosphere  strongly recommend!
came here on a sunday night with some friends  there was no wait  food was good but they were out of clams  service was decent  would come back 
due to the yelp ratings  i decided to try the seafood hotpot  the broth was good and the noodles were good  however the seafood in the dish was horrible  the shrimp was so over cooked that it shriveled to half the size of the shell  the lobster was nonexistent  the squid had the texture of rubber  even the waitress saw this and apologized to me and when she spoke about it to the owner  the owner refused to acknowledge the poor quality of the seafood  please don't waste your money and go here
it seems this is a popular place among koreans as there were many of them in the restaurant and still some were waiting outside  however i found their bbq to be not impressive  the duck and marinated pork belly were just dry and not tasty  only the hand rubbed kalbi was good but it's small in portion and expensive too  seating space was also very tight  despite the friendly service they need more staff to be attentive 
my first review   as soon as i walked in the restaurant the music thry are playing i dont mind listening to while i eat and drink  the staffs are very friendly and foods are good  i will deff come back when i want to eat good korean foods   eat and drink while listen to good music 
chill vibes   great food! servers are fantastic   ideal for parties of four or less because of the small tables but they accommodate larger parties too 
service was good but the seafood pot wasn't as fresh  since it's one of their specialties   it should be one of their best tasting dishes   the wait staff was very friendly and tend to your needs!
excellent food  a must try is their pork neck meat bbq  outstanding  tastes like beef  very tender  their noodles are also their specialty  using a special  one of a kind machine imported from korea  everything in this restaurant is perfectly seasoned  try the spicy squid (nahk gee) perfectly cooked so tender   cute restaurant with a lively modern vibe  great place to gather!
delicious! delicious! delicious!  this is my first time writing a review for a restaurant   it was that good!!we went to check out the special noodles that is made from a  machine that's unique to solbat  and it was well worth it!! the noodle was cooked al dente  firm to the bite and chewy  we tried both the cold noodles and bibimguksoo; both were so flavorful  made with fresh ingredients   we went there for the noodles  but the marinated beef and side dishes were so delicious  the marinated pork was tender and savory  cooked right in front of you on a grill which brings out the bbq flavors  the side dishes were plentiful and tasty     i would definitely go back again and again  and i live in nj 
delicious food and good service  had the marinated beef and spicy grilled octopus special  got greedy so we had the spicy chicken and pork belly as well   the waiters cook the food at your table and were very accomodating  i would definitely come back!
their seafood steamed platter wasn't as appealing as the picture shows  it really is just literally boiled seafood  the lobster was over cooked when they server cooked it for us  their bbq kalbi was extremely small  however  the service was really great  the taste of their seafood bbq and platter are so so 
149 pocha is a must if you in flushing! love the vibes music wise and food wise  the waiters waitress are friendly and know what to get us customers! great customer service seriously! recommend for anyone whos looking for kbbq place  you can get here via lirr   mta bus transit! come check this place out as their grand opening wasnt too long ago! clean place all around  what else can you wish for? hope yall have good eats here!
good food and great atmosphere! they're open late so it's a nice spot to eat and drink  staff is very attentive! definitely recommending friends and coming back again  )
if you enjoy the small dishes korean restaurants provide  this is the only one i've been to that doesn't provide small dishes lettuce or kim chi  the only good thing about the place was that its was clean  (maybe because it's only been open for 3 months)we ordered the marinated beef special x2 orders  the duck  and the cod soup mild spicy   the marinated beef kaibi we ordered was beef cubes   very chewy  the duck was dry  crispy  and over cooked  the cod soup was the most spicy soup i ever had  when we specifically requested mild  we got extra spicy  no one was able to eat it   i've been to many many kbbq places  and i've got to say this place is by far the worst we felt very rushed and we were the only customers in the restaurant 
korean bbq at its best  pocha at its best  getting my bbq n soju fix all at 1 place~~~ staff is awesome n attentive and have many dishes besides bbq also 
awesome place to go to eat and drink  great atmosphere and friendly staff  finally a place where everything on the menu tastes amazing!!! i'm definitely gong back 
fantastic place for drinks and awesome staff!! definitely revisit for dinner and of course more drinks!
tried a new place korean bbq restaurant  saemaul pocha bbq  very friendly  fast service  great food   i had the pork belly  marinated pork short ribs  and spicy chicken gizzard  also plenty of soju  lol  oh  you have to try the assorted steamed seafood  i ate it so fast  i forgot to take a picture  after the seafood is finished they put in rice and noodles for a awesome noodle soup 
had a great meal  interesting good  the kimchi soup was excellent as was the whole octopus  we also got a mixed bbq with pork belly  duck and beef  comes with many side dishes  all of it was really excellent  they cook it your table  service was great 
food is great and the staff is really friendly  awesome at this spot is fun and casual   price is reasonable as well  i will be coming here a lot from now on 
we came here for a quick bite and some korean bbq  the vibes here are awesome  parking wasn't too hard to find as well  definitely would be coming back here when i come back into queens
nice galbi so tender                     free octopus with 2 orders of galbi is good too! buy one bottle of soju  free bottle with yelp review is great too! will come back again
i came in here expecting the usual korean pocha fare  but i was pleasantly surprised  as soon as i stepped in i felt like i was in korea  pocha places are usually a little dingy and sticky and uncomfortable  but this place felt clean yet homely  the food was magnificent and the service was fabulous  definitley coming here every time im in the neighborhood 
i've been in flushing a long time and have eaten in many places   i have to say that 149 pocha is my new favorite place   i have become a regular here  the food is amazing  but more than that the atmosphere and service is top notch  what's not to like about this place? i would recommend and have recommended 149 to many of my friends 
great place to eat  drink  chill  and laugh out loud   service was on point and attentive   it's one of those great jump off spots to go to for round 1  
great atmosphere   great food   great drinks and good company  i felt like i was in korea with the good hospitality and service  must go if your in the flushing  bayside area if you just want a chill and to just kick back 
new local spot  good food  fun atmosphere  great deals!came with a group of friends and they were able to accommodate us quickly  service is on point even though it's busy food is good  we ordered a variety of meats  soups  misc  everything was delicious highly recommend all to check this place out 
everything was avg and normal except for the service  the male waiters were ok but the female waitress was very rude and impolite  we asked the waitress to order for food and drinks  she ignored us and walked away again and again  she had a really bad attitude for no apparent reason  this type of behavior is really bad for the business 
we were very excited to check out this place  we got take out for galbi  spicy eels & assorted pancakes  very disappointed    eels were very hard with fishy taste  galbi was slightly under seasoned but it tasted ok  besides pickled green onions  no kimchi or other side dishes were given  no steamed rice was provided either for our quite pricey orders     assorted pancakes were not good  overall  big disappointments  the best dish we had with the order was the pickled green onions 
the environment is great  the workers are friendly  if you're looking for a home y drinking spot then pocha 149 is for you!
wow    just honestly the best korean food place in queens hands down!! the staff is very friendly and helpful  the food is delicious and the environment is very pleasing  i will definitely recommend anyone to come here and try it 
amazing! great customer service  and the food is superb! def recommend this place if you guys have the chance!
terrible service and they try their best to cheat you for your money   served us rubber like meat where swine smell was overpowering and served us 1 serving of pork belly but charged us for 2 and said it was because "we didn't ask them for serving for 2"   couldn't stay any longer because of prior engagement and waited over an hour to eat   if you want korean bbq there are several other choices just walking distance from this dump   would give it a 0 or negative if i had choice 
good price and good service korean bbq has 9 99 promotion now  don't miss that one i love korean food and this is perfect  it blends french and korean in fun ways  i saw some of creative layout of the dessert this is one of those underrated restaurants tucked next to a hotel on a street full of construction 
this is our 'go to' place for delicious black pork belly and soju  their bbq eel and chicken feet are also favorites 
i went to eat with a bunch of friends and the bbq port was very good   i usually don't eat pork but it was so good that i ended up eating it   the side dishes were very good and the cold noodle dish was also very tasty   service was excellent   i highly recommend this place for tasty korean food 
went here for valentine's day   my family and i loved it! staff is very polite and the food is delicious!  definitely coming back!
try the jumeoluk galbi! it's so tender and melts in your mouth  with 2 servings you get a free serving of octopus or clams  i had the octopus and it wasn't tough to chew at all  mixed with a spicy sauce  it was beyond my expectations  after 1 bottle of paid soju  you get one for free  alcohol prices are very reasonable to begin with  will definitely be a regular
love their kalbi  pork belly and kimchi jigae! this restaurant also serves many side dishes which is a plus! the service is great and the staff are friendly  my new go to korean spot!
i thought this restuarant's food was good and the staff were friendly  i think this is a hidden gem and a lot of people don't know about this place  however it's truly delicious  highly reccommend for people visiting or people who have yet to discover this place 
a great local spot to unwind and chill with your friends  good comfort food to compliment the drinks
amazing! very budget friendly but delicious! would definitely recommend!!! they have amazing grand opening specials 
nice ambience excellent service  we got the marinated pork rib but everything looked so good too!! they have promotions so be sure to ask  im sure to come back
good food  good service  nice music  cheap price  nice events  it is really good place for eating food with your friends or family  i recommend this '149 pocha' ~~
service was excellent  we ordered the pork belly special for $9 99 and it was delicious  the waiter  john  told us the soju (regularly priced at $10 99) was buy one get one free (we thought it was just get one free with a check in on yelp)  overall  we enjoyed the meal and the ambiance of the restaurant 
came in for some korean bbq and left very satisfied  the beef  pork and shrimp were delicious which was accompanied by some tasty sides  i will definitely be coming back 
clean and authentic place  the prices are reasonable  they currently have a promotion ($9 99 pork belly samgeyopsal) which is a great deal 
the food is good  the service is good  the crowd is lively  what more can you ask for? a taste of korea in flushing
awesome food and staff  awesome food be staffdefinitely recommend checking this place out
i came here with my girlfriend on a saturday night and was surprised to see that it was not busy   we ordered the seafood bbq and an order of the thick cut pork belly   the waiter went to place our order only to come out 5 minutes later  to tell us they couldn't serve us the pork belly because there was a minimum requirement of two items from the bbq meat section   there was no way the two of us could finish that much food so we asked the waiter what the difference was since the grill was going to be on for the seafood platter   the waiter could not give us an explanation   the seafood platter was bland and tasteless    and only offered with two sauces that were both spicy  we had to ask the waiter to continue grilling our food as he kept trying to tell us it was ready when it was clearly undercooked    disappointing experience  bland food  staff needs to be more knowledgeable about the menu as well as how to grill the food properly  will not return
this place has good ambiance and has nice service! got deals with yelp and other things so its nice!
i'm thrilled that there's a new vegetarian place in flushing  the food here is great and the prices are very reasonable  the portions are relatively large  i had a mango roll and a thai spicy roll and they are the size of small burritos  both were fantastic  the thai spicy roll had a very tasty spicy mayo on it  my boyfriend ordered a vegetable tempura bento box and the tempura was incredibly crispy  the bento box comes with a salad and a very refreshing lemon dressing  it also came with a choice of soup  we picked the hot and sour soup which i thought was too salty and not sour enough  overall the food was very satisfying and i'll definitely be coming back here   )
vegetarian japanese restaurant  food was really good! no faux meat here  instead you'll find rolls  bento boxes and noodles  got the avocado peanut roll  inari roll  sweet potato roll  and mushroom tempura roll  also tried the chickpea curry bento box  everything tasted great  the rolls could have been assembled and rolled a little better  but enjoyed the mushroom tempura the most  chickpea curry was also great looking forward to going back and trying the rest of the menu 
this is my favorite restaurant in all of queen's  ny located conveniently across the street from flushing hospital medical center  fhmc staff  and visitors enjoy their awesome vegetarian dishes  i frequent here for lunch and dinner!the food is so tasty and healthy!the restaurant is clean and the ambiance is very soothing the owners and staff are professional and personable  they care very much about their food  service and guests  it is always a great pleasure to dine here  and convenient to take out the menu is creative and the prices are very fair  the portions will leave you satisfied and nourished but never weighed down i love the fact they cook with extra virgin olive oil i highly recommend green recipes for lunch  dinner  or events! one of my favorite rolls of the tiger eye  it is out of this world  a healthy style comfort food!the vegetable soup is perfect as a side  or its own meal  my go to soup when i am feeling under the weather as well the hot and sour soup  and miso soup are delicious too!green recipes will become an instant favorite to anyone who tries it!
no photos cuz we had a jet lagged toddler lying on my husband through dinner ha  but this was one of my favorite meals during our trip to see family in the area  my mother in law is a pro at ordering and we enjoyed 2 veggie dishes  a mixed one w snap peas and chinese yam  and of course an eggplant dish (my go to)  they have a roast chicken with the ginger scallion sauce that every table seemed t have ordered and it was very flavorful  my favorite dish was the lobster sticky rice! it comes out it one of those huge flat steam baskets and filled with succulent lobster pieces  the body pieces were sweet and tender  claws weren't great  but that's to be expected  pre cut so it was easy for me to make bites of food for my husband who was holding our toddler (no  we didn't bring a stroller on our trip womp womp)  oh we also got a egg and shrimp dish for miss a  she ate it later sleepyhead  service was prompt and professional  i liked the food a lot   much nicer than the hk cafes by our place in la!
just order a pickup from the place  salty fish with bean curd and diced chicken pot  it was okay  not great  but good for the price  as i almost finish the whole thing  i found a hair! yes  hair!!!!! i know it cannot be mine because it was buried under all the bean curd!!!! 刚刚去买了外卖带回家吃到后面下面居然有一根头发 看的我直接去厕所 吐了出来 太恶心了
the weekday lunch special is worth coming here  you get 3 dishes  soup  and 2 bowls of rice for $22 but it's on a separate menu that you have to ask for  the hk milk tea is a little on the pricey side almost $4 for iced  the 3 dishes were on the smaller side  i guess for the lunch special pricing  we got the peking style pork chop (was done very well)  mapo tofu (the tofu itself was good but the mapo sauce was a little lacking)  and the chinese broccoli with beef (wished it was a bigger portion) for 3 people  although the portions were small it was enough to fill the 3 of us for brunch  their regular menu is pretty extensive too  i would come back for their lunch specials 
their lunch special is a pretty good deal  choose 3 dishes for $21 99  comes with two bowls of rice and soup for  everyone  their phone line is currently down so cash only and you must call their 718 358 6588 number to place orders 
*link your cc to your yelp profile to get 5% cash back when dining here*it's a pretty spacious café  with plenty of seating on the inside  minimal parking in their front lot (probably can fit 5 cars max)  the food here comes out fast  but there is nothing very memorable about the place  i had the beef noodle soup ($6 95) and they ran out of the thick white noodles and had to substitute with the thin yellow egg noodles  also  the beef chunks in the noodle soup were not very beefy  they were mostly beef tendons which i am not a fan of  so the stock photo in the menu is deceiving! prices are in line for what you expect at a sit down restaurant  but i think i rather walk a few blocks up to the food court and have delicious beef noodle soup  with beef pieces for $5 instead 
huge fan of hk cafes and flushing really needed one!i ordered the short rib lunch special for $8 which comes with salad and soup  with an option of french fries or rice  i also ordered pan fried pork buns (4) for $3 25 my friend ordered stir fried soy sauce noodle for about $8 the place is clean which is rare in flushing 5 5 food came pretty quick and was still very hot  i love eating my food extremely hot!we both enjoyed our dishes  there were 6 7 ribs which i think is a decent amount for the price  my friends stir fried noodle was huge  it was enough to be shared with 2 and we still didn't finish it the food taste authentic  like it does at any other hong kong cafe  comparable to cha chan tang  but a little too oily  1 star would come back to try more of the menu!
i came here with a friend for dinner  the place was packed at night  we got one and one thing only(each of us got the same thing actually)  oxtail with rice  oxtail with rice   comes with raw dressed salad  soup  and then the dish itself   salad was unnecessary imo  like come on  this is an asian restaurant  *roll eyes* soup was very flavorful    tastes like it came from a can tho  oxtail meat was sort of tough  but bearable sauce had same base as the soup the rice portion is equivalent to 1 bowl of rice parking  right in front of the restaurant enough to fit 4 5 cars  park as long as you want; tip is necessary other notes  i looked at other diners' tables and their food looked pretty appetizing  or maybe just pretty   p
totally agree with betty l that the food here is very bland and in addition to that  very oily too! the husband and i shared a beef chow fun and shanghai noodle with our daughter  the food was so bad that i had didn't wanna continue eating  the noodles were so oily that i had to use a napkin to wipe off the oil before feeding my daughter  ugh! it was a lot of work just for lunch too! we also shared a siu mai thinking that they can't mess this dimsum up but we were wrong  the siu mai tasted rather strange and horrible per the husband  it didn't have any seasoning with one piece of shrimp in the bottom and you can only taste the meat  it was definitely not a typical dim sum siu mai #facepalmwhat we can't believe is how badly they messed up on a hong kong classic dish  beef chow fun  when the name of this restaurant is hk cafe! #sighduck won't be returning even if they have the special lunch and dinner deals which we opted out of  super meh!
today is chinese lunar year last day of rooster，every one is happy to celebrate with family or friend we have great time to eat here 
big place for hong kong style bakery food  it open till 12 00  good price for the food and spacious 
stopped here for lunch today  my uncle says this place changes out a lot  it was a sushi place  then american food place and now back to hong kong food  eh  the service is bleh  all they did was bring out drinks and food  well they forgot about drinks until we reminded them once they brought out food  but that's all they did  they didn't come back to ask or check if we needed anything  the food      so so so bland  either too bland or too much sauce  one of our dish was super sauce and then the other three were super bland  no taste to it whatsoever  don't think we will be returning here 
this place serves hk style dishes  cantonese food  congee  noodle soup  roast meats  and even western inspired dishes  they have this great lunch menu  which comes sith choice of rice or pasta  soup and salad  i strongly recommend the pasta  it was so good  i actually ordered one to go for lunch at work the next day  the portion lasted me two meals though  of all the options  the short ribs is the best  i wouldn't recommend the curry chicken  the oxtail was ok  but want tender enough  on the western style menu they have these rice baked dishes  and oh dear  it's huge  larger than i anticipated and it was really good  i ordered the baked porkchop over rice  it's baked with onions  tomatoes and cheese  it was delicious  def get your money's worth   they only accept cash
i think the quality and service has definitely gone down since the last time i came here  which was only 2 months ago  staff were not friendly nor attentive like they used to be  my favorite dish from here that i always order  the curry chicken on rice was hard and dry  they used (bad?) boned in chicken parts for the dish and it had a weird taste to it  which was not very appetizing  on top of that  they no longer have my favorite  borscht soup that is included with the lunch special but instead  it's canned clam chowder (yes  canned) and ranch dressing instead of thousand island  ( they now take credit cards (used to be cash only) and their parking lot is no longer free (there's a mandatory $2 tip for valet)  very disappointed  will not be returning again 
as my mom and i walking along main st   she decided to try this spot  i didn't want to eat too much so my mom ordered pan fried buns and beef chow fun (dry)  the buns are so small and the pork filling is shaped like a quarter shape  the color of the chow fun was light for my liking  overall mediocre food  there are other better spots in flushing 
i've driven past this location of few times but was never really in the area because it is quite a distance from the main street 7 train station  they have a few spots outside for valet parking and will charge you $2  so you are better off just looking for street parking i've been looking for a good hk food spot and was hoping this was it  this spot used to be a vegetarian restaurant many years back  but then it closed and a bunch of different restaurants kept opening but didn't do too well  so on a hot summer day while i was craving hk style food  i decided to finally visit this place since it was my first time here  i decided to ask the waitress for recommendations  however  i felt like she was trying way too hard to sell the expensive items on the menu like lobster  seafood  a whole chicken  etc  even going as far as saying "if it's too much food  you can always pack it home " i came here for a small and simple hk style dish  not a giant meal that requires me lugging around the leftovers in the hot sun for the remainder of the day (this was lunch by the way) in the end i went with the wonton noodle soup and thought it was mediocre  their coffee milk tea mix  on the other hand  was actually pretty good 
this place has a good variety of hk style food   the cuisine is authentic and price is good 
this is my go to spot in flushing for a quick meal! i love the roast duck or wontons with egg noodles and my bf loves the pepper steak with rice  it's a spacious restaurant and the food comes out super fast  i'm from hong kong and i do wish that they had more hk style noodle options  hk breakfast or street food  don't think it's a truly authentic hk restaurant but it's a good spot for chinese food 
large portions  good pricing  tasty! i've found my new regular food spot for late night suppers  the place opens til midnight  and has a vast variety of options of the menu to choose from  which also includes lunch special!
3 stars this place is a bit upscale by hk cafe standards and menu offerings a bit more limited than they "standard" hk cafe  but it's cleaner fwiw quality wise overall kinda average  date friendly so to speak but parking tough 
new place in town! the place looks new and spacious  the decor looks great and the arrangement looks great  the food was good  i ordered mapo tofu over rice  the mapo tofu was well prepared  good balance between the spiciness and the ingredients flavor  i will come back to this place more often!
coming from texas  i've always been happy knowing that moving to new york meant better chinese food  specifically cantonese food  my experience at hk cafe made me second guess that affirmation a bit  i went in with my boyfriend at 2pm in the middle of the weekday and there were 4 waiters and only 4 tables  i was happy since i was starving and thought  great  the service will be quick and i can get the food quickly!first off  the service was so slow throughout the meal  our waters were constantly empty  the waiters kept forgetting to bring us either napkins  or the extra plate we asked for  etc  as a former waitress  i understand that things get a bit crazy and you might forget something and that's totally fine    but it was not busy  all the waiters were just strolling around the restaurant looking outside the windows  food wise  i got the baked pork chop over rice  and the rice they used was definitely not jasmine rice  and it gave a weird taste  the milk tea was only super expensive  and the whole lunch ended up being more expensive than i anticipated  especially since we were in flushing and could have easily gotten something cheaper and quicker 
attention all yelpers who loved lok lok   they are back to making cantonese food and hk style cafe food  yaaaay! 5 stars just for the conversion back to their delicious cantonese food but this time it's even better  not only is there cantonese dishes  they added hk style cafe food  yay  i for one love it! there is so much to try that we decided to start with their lunch menu because this way the two of us can sample more  the lunch special menu is from 11 am to 4 pm for $8 99  after 4pm you can still order it for $3 more  we decided to order the grilled short ribs  stewed oxtail russian style and curry chicken  the two of us knew it will be a lot of food but it's a good way to try a few dishes  the lunch dishes come with a bowl of delicious hk style borscht soup  a small salad with french dressing and your choice of side  pasta  french fries or white rice  we had the white rice with curry chicken and the other two dishes we opted for spaghetti minus the cheese since we're lactose intolerant  we also ordered the rice roll with mixed sauce from the dim sum menu  the highlight were the three lunch dishes we ordered  first of all i was soooooo happy to see the hk style borscht soup  it's my favorite soup of all time  reminds me of my mom  my mom and i made it one day when i was younger  it is so delicious  it's tomato based and has nothing to do with russian borscht soup  there is zero beets in the hk style borscht soup  it is a tomato based soup cooked with beef  celery  onion  carrot  at hk cafe  it was on point  delicious  the salad is whatever  it's a little roughage  i loved the stewed oxtail russian style  the taste profile is very similar to the borscht which is fine because i love it  it is tomato based with potatoes  carrots  and deliciousness  the spaghetti with tomato sauce was also flavorful  for $8 99  this was a really good meal  the chicken curry with white rice was also very very yummy  it's made with dark meat only  awesome  white meat is dry anyways and bland so who needs it! there were some potatoes in it and i just removed the chicken skin before i ate it  delicious  it was very tasty and it was a little different than the normal chinese curry flavor  the flavor was actually different and i enjoyed it very very much  it surprised me  in a good way  then the last dish to come out  the pièce de résistance was the grilled short rib  when it first came out the other waiter put cheese all over the pasta  the original waitress took it away because she knew i can't have dairy  that was really nice of her and we tipped her extra just because she understood it was very bad if i had it  i have very bad lactose intolerance  i will get really sick if i have dairy  the short ribs were soooo delicious  omg  i bit into thinking the worse but i was sooooo proven wrong  it was soft and soooo flavorful  omg  i could not eat more at the time because i was so full  i took everything home and i can't wait to have it again the old lok lok used to have a family combo special where you pick 3 entrees and it comes with soup and 2 bowls of rice for $21 95  i hope they bring that type of deal back so i can try a larger variety of dishes  i want to come back and try other dishes so bad  thanks to michael l for letting me know that the steak and sushi place is now hk cafe  i believe it's the same owner and cook  i can't wait to go back again and again  welcome back lok lok  ooops  i meant hk cafe! i am soooo happy that it is cantonese and hk style cafe food now that i will go back again and again  yay  hopefully there will not be anymore drastic changes again  yay they serve cantonese "bbq roasted" meats  i e  roasted duck  roast pork  roasted crispy skinned pig  etc   but at hk cafe it is not displaying in the window  hk cafe is not a place to come buy the "bbq" meats by the pound  ** cash only****fried chicken wings  woah! you gotta try it! it's delicious!**
so lok lok is back as hk cafe      after some missed calculation of steak & sushi place which lasted only several months i like the lunch special with five difference choices and comes with soup and salad  we actually tried 4 out of 5  each one is good especially the oxtail and curry chicken  rated 5 5 their wide noodle with beef is lot less attractive and lack in flavor'\; need improvement  rated 3 5the shanghai noodle was not that good either  lack flavor  lack ingredients and too much on the onions  rated 3 5waiters are sometime great and sometimes just not available; mostly because there is enough to coverage all the tables when it is busy at lunch time lunch specials are available on weekends too parking in front of restaurant is $2 
came here after my dress fitting at paris for a quick lunch with my bridesmaids  it had convenient parking if you can't find parking for valet it's 2 dollar tip  i ordered beef chow fun it was a really large portion  i came here before but never got a chance to review  every experience i've had here was good  food was decent and comparable to typical chinese dim sum spots but they get an additional star for service 
i went over there with my family for lunch today  i was really surprise that the food are really good  everyone in my family did enjoy all the food that we had order  the menu has a lot of choice and different style of western food too  the restaurant is clean  price is reasonable and the service is average  i have to asked the waiter come over to change our plate  the only thing bother me a little is that the restaurant has free valet parking in front of the location  and there is a sign states you must give the parking attendant $2 tips! $2 isn't too much money  but  you don't demanding tips!!!!!
very standard hk style food  reasonable price and easy parking  i especially liked the salt & pepper squid  and shrimp wonton soup  this place wouldn't disappoint yet wouldn't wow you  nothing to rave about and nothing to complain about  perfect place for a quick meal without insulting your palate 
this space used to be the lok lok restaurant but they changed ownership and re branded   they continue to offer $2 valet parking out front mayo shrimp   3 stars   flavors as you'd expect but very small portion; bit of a rip offhot and spicy diced chicken   1 star   we didn't expect the chicken to be diced bone in; extremely difficult to eat and barely any meatsalt and pepper pork chop   4 stars   nice crisp but over did it with the saltwide noodles with shrimp   5 stars   definitely the star of the meal; very sizable plate tooi was surprised we could not find any pure green vegetable dishes on the menu   in any case  service was good and prompt 
seems this place on main street is constantly changing names (it was called lok lok a few months ago)  hopefully it'll still be named hk café by the time you go   they serve cantonese and shanghai dishes  my family and i went there at busy prime dinner time (7pm on a sunday)  place was packed and people were lined up with numbers for seating  luckily  we were a large enough group so we were able to grab the last large table  we waited like five minutes     )the wait staff was super quick to clean and setup and quite attentive even though it was super busy  the menu was easy to read through  nice pics and plenty of variety (category wise) so it was easy to find food for all  even my picky 7 yr old (she ate the fries okay  just saying) for starters we ordered the soup dumplings (6 pcs)  the scallion pancakes (picky girl liked it too  a win for me)  and fried dumplings for the table  the soup dumplings were small to medium in size  it is not the quality like a real shanghai place would churn out   they tasted fine flavor wise but it was smaller than it should be   still juicy   there was soup in it  the fried dumplings were crisp and good texture   was not overly oily and my son devoured it so i would say it was worth it   i tried one and liked the meat filling   the scallion pancakes were very good  extra crispy and definitely saw the scallions   simple and as expected the entrees   lobster with ginger and scallion  was cooked right but not to the level of a larger "family style seafood restaurant" quality   totally enjoyable still and satisfies the craving       shanghai rice noodles with pork  had a good amount of green veggies (mustard greens and shanghai bok choy) with slivers of pork   not too soft   hubby likes it chewy so this was a good texture     sauteed chives with squid   this was a nice change for a veggie dish  my family usually orders spinach and peas so having the chives was refreshing  it is a simple dish  as it sounds   the squid was great   spaghetti with meat sauce and fried egg  as i said something for all   this was my son's request (10 year olds  go figure)   he enjoyed it thoroughly  didn't even want to share  but i did manage to get to try the spaghetti and the tomato sauce was on the sweeter side (not a surprise in chinese restaurants)   it was a good east meets western dish     house special half chicken (cage free)  very tender  tasted really fresh  and don't be fooled by it's yellow skin color  tasted just as yummy as any soy based chicken   you don't miss the sauce here   it is indeed a signature dish   stewed oxtail combo meal  this came with a large bowl of stewed oxtail (reddish brown gravy)  and had lots of carrots   this was the best deal (price wise) and very good for sharing   it came with a house salad (individual portion) and a small soup   this was my favorite side note   treat this place like a casual family style dining   almost like a hk style canteena but with table service   it's prices make it a keeper and for the casual and relaxed ambiance   it does serve wine (we didn't order any) and they do sell bubble tea drinks   i wish i ordered but forgot about it once i was eating as the plates just kept coming  i would go back for the price and convenience   and it's far off from the hustle bustle of main street so i liked that i wasn't on top of people to get in and out 
big promotion~3 dishes 1 soup 2 rice only $21 99! chicken taste so good  i think which is the most delicious chicken in flushing area!
came here for a family style meal  this place was like any other place   nothing spectacular  the worst was athe xiao long bao because the skin was too thin and it just broke  it tasted fine but the whole point of those is to eat it whole with soup  disappointing  nothing too salty and decent  but that's the whole verdict  however  the problem came with the service  we ordered plenty of dishes in which they repeated to us in verbatim  however there were still mistakes  we had several dishes that came out wrong but we accepted since it was already here  the other is the fact that the wait staff seems to be too slow to realize we ran out of tea and water  it took us until almost finishing before it was refilled  but what's worst was when my boyfriend dropped his tea on the floor  i know it's busy but if you hear the drop of the cup or if you see the customer cleaning  you should do something  however no one came to help   none  that was truly disappointing as my boyfriend cleaned their wet floors with the napkin they provided  and for those who worry about bathrooms  theirs is clean but the floor is a bit sticky 
excited to try this place and came on a weekday to get takeout  3 5 stars actually (food court in elmhurst is better)i ordered the oxtail lunch special ($8 95) that came with either pasta  fried rice  and few other options  also came with a delicious soup + salad (i didn't even get a dressing for it)  also got an order of the shanghai fried noodle ($8 95) i believe it's called (thick noodles + meat + mushroom)  flavored really well except the meat was dry overcooked and under seasoned (felt like i was chewing on rubber) try it for yourself and don't get what i ordered  get something else that's popular or you'll be wasting your money  not the best place for value of money but this place changed 3x since it opened soo i hope they do better with this cafe 
decent place  quick service  and friendly staffs     came here for breakfast with family plus visiting relative before she flys back to asia(dont wanna say exact place lol)  portions are big especially the congees  i couldn't finish mine since we also ordered some dim sum too   
a decent hong kong style spot in flushing that has more chinese offerings than said hong kong authentic style dishes  the variety of the menu is worth the trip here and back  we like getting the roast duck over noodles  the broth is delicious  the duck is on the salty side but compliments the plain noodles (hor fun is better) really well! would return to try other dishes and their iced milk tea 
after leaving the presbyterian hospital due to a dislocated shoulder from diving  we wanted to eat at the qq cafe  instead  we came here  before it was the lok lok restaurant the restaurant wasn't that busy at the time  we ordered their wanton noodle soup  we thought that it took a long time for it to make  the wonton noodle soup was visually appealing  the noodles are chewy and the soup was clear 
just finished dinner here  we ordered cage free chicken congee  wonton noodle soup and lamb with yuba  we like the congee and noodle soup most  the portion of lamb is generous and the taste is okay the service is good and quick 
the food here is ok   i was here on a saturday morning and parking was horrendous around the area   they have a small parking area outside the restaurant and it's packed  good luck finding parking  in terms of food  i wished there was more dim sum options  we got the steam rice noodles  which was alright  i kinda like the ones from canteen 88   the soup dumplings was bad  don't get it    the wonton noodle soup was good  wantons were fresh   the chicken congee was a ok  portion size was small and pricing is a little on the higher side  interior is nice and looked a lot more modern than before   overall  it was an ok experience 
i used to come here a lot and i've seen the owner change this place a couple times already  but overall  they had pretty good service  the servers are very attentive and give us tissues even when we don't ask for it  the menu has a lot of choices now  in the morning it's mainly dimsum from 9am  starting from 11am and on other dishes are offered as well  it's authentic hong kong style food  my favorite was the pan fried stuffed pork buns  their portions are pretty reasonable for their prices as well  for later hours  they have great meal combos that customers can order from  their drinks range more bubble tea  japanese matcha to thai iced tea  it's nice to have a lot of choices  they have parking right outside the restaurant which is always a plus  especially in flushing 
we came here because it was close to the queens botanical garden   the place was packed for lunch and we had to wait a bit for a table to open up  we don't mind that at all since that means it's popular and the food is fresh   they have a wide menu  i had the minced beef congee  it was good  i also ordered the siu mai (pork dumplings)  that was surprisingly bland and bad  they didn't have worcestershire sauce which usually goes with siu mai   we also ordered one of the lunch special dishes  oxtail stew (tomato sauce  with carrots  celery and potatoes)  which came with vegetable soup (bland  not hot)  salad and fries (hot and fresh) overall a good experience and i'd go here again 
not surprisingly from my first review  but this place is closed down due to health inspections
come in for the very 1st time recommended by friends  the dishes here are well presented and doesn't disgrace me and my companions  the owner and servers are well service   one excellent dish that needed to recommend is the drunken chicken which melted to the mouth even for a non meat eater like me   
this is one of my favorite spots to hit up in flushing  mostly bc it's free parking out front    and it's not smack in the central congested part  the hours are great for breakfast until a quick late dinner (closes at midnight)  this place really lives up to be a "hong kong cafe"  quite authentic for food  i think this is the best wonton mee in the queens area! i take back what i said about sifu chow on prince st     their noodles reminds me of the delicious ones from famous hong kong joints  the noodles are tangy and thin  the broth is wonderful    tastes extra delicious if you add some duck pieces as a topping  the wontons are smaller than at sifu chow but they're more wholesome  you see some shrimp chunks! i absolutely love it  cage free chicken congee is not bad  has cilantro which is different  it's thick  had their preserved egg & pork congee and it's not so good  they put sesame oil in their congee so it really alters the traditional congee taste imo  husband loves the tomato and egg with beef over rice  fried pork buns are pretty good  drinks are nice although a bit pricey  the shanghai noodles are awful  since this place is new  it's clean  well kept  nicely decorated where it's not embarrassing to bring someone you semi have to impress  and very polite waitstaff  a lottttttt of variety in the menu  recommend for breakfast to lunch 
i just stopped by but it is closed due to violation of food and mental health since august 10  2017  i found the food during lunch to be oily  the previous times i had dinner were good 
best hong kong style cafe i've been to  the wanton soup with shrimp is to die for and the fried rice was amazing  you have to try the chinese tea  it is great with sugar  the scallion pancakes were out of this world!!!!!
we ordered the peking duck on christmas eve  and even though the place was busy we were given great service  the waitresses and waiters were extremely nice  although a little frazzled from the amount of customers  they were also quick to give us extras of the toppings to the duck wraps which were delicious and flavorful 
great new hong kong restaurant in flushing! this place seems to keep changing  maybe this restaurant will stick around  good hong kong and cantonese food  also some shanghai dishes  modern decor and pretty spacious  pretty good selection on the menu  the baked pork chop over spaghetti was good 
i was really happy that lok lok is reincarnated  but was super disappointed that the quality has gone way down  i'm still giving it 4 stars because i want them to get back to their old standards! in reality  i thought it was more like 2 3 stars  i miss the rice rolls with shrimp and cruellers back in the lok lok days  please bring that back!!!!! their dumplings are also not as good as they used to be  and their turnip cakes too 
4 entrees ordered free range chicken  tasty  but too much white meatshanghai thick noodle   it was not really "thick" noodle  more of like "medium" noodle house stir fry   expertly done consisted squid  silver fish  chives and arrow roots water spinach   okayservice was crispy and bath room was spotless more if 3 5 stars since it lacked multiple signature dishes 
delicious food  expedited servicethis restaurant serves a variety of traditional hong kong style cafe food   their fried chicken wings were delicious! large  juicy  and tender wings   shen jian bao (pan seared pork buns) has just the right amount of broth and were seared just right to have a crispy bottom yet fluffy top  note  these buns also had the perfect amount of meat to bread ratio  we actually saw them making the buns in the back  two chefs were making them in a very clean and organized counter top  baked pasta wasn't novel but the comfort food was made just sweet enough to remind me of the actual baked pasta that is served in hong kong   drinks i would say the boba ice tea was status quo  nothing too exciting but at least the boba balls were chewy and not stale  ditto for the thai ice tea and watermelon juice service wise i would say was great  this is a very busy restaurant so you could tell they rush to get you your food and then rush you out the door  no biggie tho  this is not the type of establishment to meander at  parking is a toughie though  there's only about 16 spots total  you can leave your keys with someone at the restaurant if you have double parked but just know that public parking is limited 
i am so glad they decided to go back to cantonese cuisine versus the steak and sushi operation they had before  lunch time is busy as hell! luckily  we were able to get a seat for 9 fairly quickly even though it was chaos  they offer the hong kong style milk teas and coffees  plenty of food options! the chicken wings were surprisingly good  it had the perfect crunch and was well seasoned  i would definitely get it again  the cage free chicken congee was good and not too salty  the soy sauce noodles were the winner! the entire table really liked it and i liked that they added a variety of seafood and some vegetables so it's not too boring  the hor fun noodles with sauteed beef were standard  and of course  who can forget wonton soup   good but not as good as the original lok lok location  all great portions to share  disappointed that they don't have dim sum options but they do have a plain rice noodle roll with peanut sauce dip if you're looking for something similar  clean restaurant  good food  cozy enough  i would definitely come back to try more dishes!
the food quality is decent  they could have done a better job on dishes they brought out of the kitchen  nothing looks any close to ones in the menu  by the way  if you don't speak cantonese  they don't give a f**k  terrible experience  terrible service !
really good canto food  lots of choices and of course has your typical canto dishes  my fav has to be the cage free chicken and the veggie mixed with seafood (mini fried fish  chives  celery) stir fry  i also ordered a simple fried rice dish (finely diced eggs  onions  chinese sausage  white raisins) which i really enjoyed as well  the food definitely is very delicious  but as usual with chinese restaurant food they get a bit oily  so i recommend to get a good mix of lightly flavored veggie dish and fried dishes 
the wonton noodle soup  salt and pepper chicken w  white rice  and the dumpling noodle soup are worth getting here  service wasn't spectacular but the interior is modern and nice 
it was surprising to see that they had decent prices  food was decent  good variety  we ordered scallion pancakes (m14)  shumai shaomai (m11)  pan fried radish cake  luobuogao (m18)  shanghai fried crude noodles (r8) and wonton noodle soup (n1)  scallion pancakes $1 50 is pretty good in this flushing area   radish cake tasted very fresh and not dense  the rest was not much to boast  but the prices made up for it  the shanghai fried crude noodles did not come out the way their picture showed   the color was off  and it looked like a spicy dish with chili flakes   no chili flakes when the dish came as you can see in the picture 
when its grand opening it was very good  after a few months try try again the good are  getting worse  they use different chef 100% 
great food! i always try a new dish when i come and i'm never disappointed  the closed for a couple of days for renovation (to move fridge in the kitchen for space)  but they are back in business!
the food is the authentic and good for the value  beware of the arrogant and rude valet parker though 
i'm not recommend   because i don't really like their service  also the food taste is so so  why they still can get the many good reviews! unbelievable! !
hk cafe in my opinion is somewhere between a 3 5 4 star restaurant  the duck noodle soup is a staple that i enjoy getting whenever i come  the hk milk tea takes a bit long to make  but it's made fresh  overall all the food is good and comforting  but nothing extraordinary 
here to order take out  absolutely a mess  the front desk lady was busy getting orders right for a good ten minutes  didn't even other if i needed help  asked other waiters to help  still got no attention  had to "yell" to get my order placed  ridiculous 
i went there just to have a quick lunch with my parents  ordered their famous hk milk tea and some dishes for lunch  each and everyone of us got diarrhoea after visiting that place
this is one of the places serving good wontons  the soup base is not as salty as the other restaurants which can bring out the taste of the wontons  the fried noodles and fried flat noodles meet the standards   too bad that they do not serve e fu noodles which is one of my favorite   the hk style milk tea is a little weak on the tea favor   will return to try more dishes   
ordered a combination rice dish with red roast pork and roast duck  the roast duck pieces were a majority bone and had very little meat  half of the pork was just fat  and the glaze was way too sweet   almost as if they had added sugar to the regular honey glaze  this was $7 99  definitely not worth it  saves a trip to chinatown though since it's one of the few places in flushing that advertises itself as a hong kong style cafe 
the congee and wonton noodle soup here is really good! the prices are pretty cheap and the place is clean  the waitresses were also nice and patient with us
i am giving hk cafe 5 stars    this use to be me and my family's go to chinese restaurant when it was lok lok  i was really sad when they decided to change it to a steak and sushi restaurant  but they have opened up again and now offering more variety on their menu!their wonton mein is the best in flushing   and the sweet and sour pork chop is perfectly fried with the perfect amount of sour and sweet  the wait staff is so attentive and so honest  i went there for dinner last night  and left my wallet at the restaurant  they kept it for me and when i looked in my wallet  nothing was missing  all my money is there!this is a must go   and i def will be going back for more! best part is now they open till 2am and have all the hk cafe yummie dishes  like french toast and baked spaghetti 
i was here around 6  i ordered 1 milk tea (hk) style  and i'm still in the bathroom  something must be wrong with the milk tea!! horrible!! service sucks!! front desk slow (i was here the first  second week grand opening)  waited for so long for just wonton (taste nasty) and beef chow fun  i gave so many chances and i'm sure it will be my xxxxing last chance!! do not believe all the rating here!! lok lok originally taste bad and dirty  now i found out it's from lok lok  nah  no way      
we had a large party of 15  with kids and 4 vegetarians  service was excellent  friendly and responsive  food was delicious  updated presentations and riffs on classic cantonese banquet fare  dishes were bright and naturally flavorful  without excessive salt or msg  appetizer platter featured customary jellyfish with sweet & sour daikon pickles  but also not so typical spare rib bits with fried braised taro dice  and french fry like fish tempura; but most unusual was crisp chewy strips of pork bung! whole chicken  hacked  was perfectly done and tender  steak in just right bites  and lamb chops (is that cantonese?) served med well were juicy and soft with light breaded crust and mushroom  pepper sauté in the middle  vegetarians enjoyed excellent buddha's delight with lotus root  mountain yam  snow peas  and several types of mushrooms  as well as a heaping platter of pea leaves stir fried with goji berries  and light noodle stir fry  fried prawns coated in a curry colored creamy sauce was actually a savory salted duck yolk sauce that reminded of parmesan  cheese   umami! fried rice finisher had  bits of shrimp and scallops and surprising sweet morsels of golden raisins  new plates changed at just the right times and empty tea and ice water promptly refilled  live fish tanks were clean and fish looked healthy   a good sign  heard that they have breakfast (big coffee urns behind counter)  and lunch specials that are a real deal  also observed bubble tea machine shaking up a batch  decor is modern   lots of glass  open kitchen window  red table clothes (but paper napkins)  and bathrooms pretty clean (although  why do chinese restaurants have to keep their mops and cleaning supplies in front of bathrooms?!) valet parking available for a $2 tip   another good deal  new favorite 
the dishes weren't flavorful and not that good  the prices were inexpensive compared to other places though  won't be coming back 
husband loves coming here for the lunch special  oxtail over rice with soup and salad  i personally like the rice rolls with hoisin and peanut sauce  not too oily compared to other places and the preserved egg with pork congee (has enough dosage of ginger shreds for my liking )
i had the shanghai crab soup dumplings and it was the best in flushing  !!!!!! their congee is on point because these people used to do sweet and tart the best congee in manhattan and flushing   the rest didn't try yet
previously serving cantonese comfort food  this restaurant then changed to a steak and sushi place temporarily before thankfully returning to cantonese food  parking can be challenging if one wants to find street parking  it's bus accessible but not subway accessible  food is generally solid  including salt and pepper pork chop and the classic chopped chicken with the ginger oil sauce  hk milk tea is good  service is typical for these types of places  but our young waitress was particularly indifferent and insolent  she also happened to neglect to add an order and later forgot to make sure another dish came out   a good meal nonetheless because of the food and the company  only takes cash 
we were happy to check it out and came back a few times  the good  service is friendly and efficient  large menu and decent tasting foodthe bad  the pictures of the lunch selections have nothing to do with what you get  do not trust lunch special salmon that you on an huge electronic display  the portion is tiny and no asparagus (inspite of advertisement) included chinese version of the russian borcht is quite tasty  but for some strange reason you can only have it with a lunch selection (which is limited and not really good)  we offered to pay for this borcht separately  but they refused to service it  why?also  they charge $1 50 for a tiny bowl of rice  ridiculous! $18 walnut shrimp (tasty but very small portion) and they are too cheap to give you rice with that? wtf? they have bubble tea drinks  most of the time  on a busy saturday afternoon they were out of bubbles  we always order one of their drinks and the quality is inconsistent  the very first time  drinks were great  since then they are getting more and more watery though quality of food and drinks rapidly declining  it is still a decent place for a family and kids 
i had their spicy lamb spine pot  super good  not expensive at all  definitely coming back soon
i found da dong bei randomly  like people used to do in the pre yelp era  it had no outside menu posted and then the menu had no descriptions so there was a bit of guesswork  but i asked the waitress about the smoked meat salad and ordered it  it included chicken  a pork item (knuckles i believe) and tofu  it has an intense flavor  you may not want to spend as much time dealing with bones but hard core meat fans should check it out  given the unusual menu and friendly service i'll probably be back soon 
great dong bei food get the special stew for gods sake that's why they have this fancy table in front of you 
tried this place about a year ago  at that time was not bad  today came back  experience was  horrible  the place dirty and disorganized  fishy smell when you enter the door  rusty objects scattered around the restaurant  no wonder they got b grade   food quality much worse than before especially pan fried food  waitress awkward service  predict the place will close down within 6 months  let's see 
da dong be is a traditional chinese northeast food restaurant  most people don't quite understand what is traditional northeast chinese food  while  they should come to this restaurant and give it a try  sometimes i feel it's hard to describe what a dish looks like  basically they have a pot that allow you put fish  duck  chicken or goose along with some vegetables  tofu  rice noodle and some other food  especially in winter  have a pot with everything usually makes you feel warm and happy  we ve been here for several times  every time we have different feelings  but considering some culture differences on food and cook  i am not expecting that people all understand me  but for me  this is really a nice place to make me recall the view and taste of my hometown
came here searching for an alternative to fu run ran that serves dong bei food  specifically the much sought after cumin lamb ribs  this place has them and they are terrific  as good or better than fu run  the portion is larger and more expensive at $36  but more is better  this version was pretty true to the others i've had but was just expertly cooked  tender and succulent  the rest of the food we had was also good  it looks like the main draw here is the hot pots  which looked huge and really good  i would come back to get one but it would be hard not to get the cumin lamb  btw it's listed here as mongolian style lamb 
ok flavor  badly managed  mean owner  loud environment  not recommended  and definitely not going again i am from china and some of my local friends from nyc want to try some authentic chinese food  so we went there  i would say i am a nice person and rarely give any bad review  but the experience of this time really makes me wanna say something 1  the flavor is authentic  but just about average level  i am originally from north china and i have tried a lot of deep pot stews like theirs  it might be relatively good in us  but please don't expect too much 2  the places is badly managed  especially the reservation system  i strongly doubted that if the owner really has such a long time experience like they advertised  with such bad management  at beginning  we were told there was no table  even we called and tried to reserve 2 hours earlier  however  he promised he could leave a table for us if we could get there at 5 30  instead of our original plan at 6 pm  i got there at 5 32 and actually called him before that  he has already given our reserved table to someone else  and asked us to wait at reception  until all of us arrived to be seated  it was so embarrassing that we were instantly told that we could have our seats  instantly after my non asian friend came in  and carefully asked that if he could take that spicy  with some kinds of weird enthusiasm 3  the owner is really mean  after we were seated  we were told that we could only stay there to 7 pm  because another reservation has been taken with our seat  we would not even take those seats if we could be told before our waiting  anyways  we ordered and got the food at around 6 10  and finished about half of it at 7 pm while talking  then the owner came and ask us to leave since there were a group people came in  i asked if we could finish the rest of the food and we were not gonna order anything more  he gave me a weird smile  went back and ask them to wait right next to our table  so we just left and give some tips in cash to the waiter  and told them that was an really awful experience  after i got home  i realized that he actually charged me for those 2 side dishes which are guaranteed free  as we re posted their promotional blog 4  the environment is super loud   and it's really hard to hear your friends' talking unless you are yelling too  people are drinking  laughing and yelling like a typical street restaurant in china  which i would say i have used to that  but it's definitely not enjoyable  anyways  i would not go there anymore  wish you guys good luck that you could finish your meal there 
classic dong bei flavor!!!!! remind me my hometown! really like here! i will recommend my friends come over and try something here!
can not believe how dirty and messy this place is  go check out yourself! man  food is mediocre and hygiene is a big deal   will never come back!!!
let me start by i really like this place  although i'm not from the northeastern provinces  but close enough and i've had enough authentic dong bei meals in china  i would recommend it to everyone who loves dong bei stews (乱炖）we made a reservation for four for a saturday lunch  it's really great that they offer free parking! we arrived early and there was only one group  we were seated immediately  this restaurants were specialized in fish and goose pot  but probably they want to attract more people  they later introduced a lamb spine pot  we have two guys that are really into lamb  so we went with the lamb pot  when we were ordering  we wanted to order another dish fish head with flour cakes (鱼头泡饼)  but the waiter was really honest and suggested it's too much for us  he's more than correct  we ordered five sides in total  oyster mushrooms  frozen tofu  tofu skin  and two orders of flour cakes the pot was iron made and huge  looks really authentic dong bei style  one star off for the lamb because they were really not lamb spine  they were not boiled long enough so not tender enough  also some pieces were really fat that even our lamb lover can't eat many pieces  but other than that  the stew base tastes perfect and all the sides taste amazing in it  the lamb stew comes with potato and corns for free  the size of the side is also really generous  $6 for 15 20 pieces of frozen tofu! four of us were really full for $120 including tips and we packed about half of the lamb  i would definitely come back to try the fish or goose pot!
a fusion hot pot experience that is truly unique where melons  the winter and water variety kind take center stage in this restaurant  the broth is extraordinary in the sense that it is already rich and full bodied and the addition of melons cooking in the pot gives it another kick in flavor  if you like to drink the soup from the hot pots  you are definitely going to love the soupy broth here  on a down note  there are no individual pots  these are large community pots to share  we ordered the winter melon with the signature non spicy soup base and the ying yang pot which had one side that was spicy(mah lat) while the other was the signature soup the server punches your order into the ipad and the food starts coming out  everything here is a la carte and may i add very fresh  we ordered the following that night * slice fish and fresh fish paste in a piping bag* fresh ground beef balls  slice pork and lamb* vegetable platter that included  pumpkin  nappa cabbage  mushroom  corn and radish * live drunken shrimp and fatty beef* prime beef made into a meat dress and draped on a barbie like doll  move over lady gaga!* tofu and tofu skins* noodles and eggsas the food was cooking the servers helped us skim out the excess foam floating on top of the hot pot  this aesthetically made the broth in the pot more appealing  as we kept cooking and putting stuff in the flavors kept growing more intense and delicious  towards the end of our meal the servers helped us cut the wintermelon and added them to the hot pot we also ordered barbecue skewers of chicken  lamb and squid  these are cooked by the chef at the open grilling station  they were pretty tasty  there is a small station for you to prepare your sauce  remember  if you parked your car in the arcadia mall  make sure to get your ticket validated by the restaurant  your discount for parking is linked to how long you dine at the restaurant   great meal and a little more pricier than traditional hot pots  but you can't beat the quality  decor and service 
just another hot pot restaurant in flushing  i also thought it was a bit overpriced for the amount of food  but that usually applies to most hot pot places that aren't ayce anyway the broth was actually very flavorful and delicious  if you like tomato soup  please try the tomato oxtail soup  it was soo yummy and really gave all of the food some flavor  it also did not taste watered down every time they added more water to the pot which is always a plus the yin and yang broth tasted very herbal and the spicy portion actually tasted very spicy! the spiciness kind of lingers in your throat so it was nice to switch between the spicy and non spicy side of it  there was the average choices of hot pot foods like fish balls  vegetables  and the meats  everything was displayed and plated very nicely  i recommend getting the vegetable platter because it had a lot of varieties  but it had a lot of mushroom options and not enough of vegetables the skewers were about $2 3 each and it was very well seasoned  however  the beef was a bit chewy so i struggled a bit while eating it the service was surprisingly slow even though there were only 2 tables there   we had to remind them several times that they forgot some of the foods that we ordered and i had to call them several times for their attention   however  they were pretty quick in refilling hot water in the pot and tea overall  it was an average hot pot place with a cute decor  but it's not really worth the price  it was overpriced and i left spending a lot and not full 
my expectations were quite low given the 3 stars it currently holds  but my experience surpassed it completely!my friend and i ordered the winter melon soup  barbie beef  handmade fish paste  and a veggie platter  the soup was very flavorful and it did not taste like the usual msg filled broths that many hotpot places have  as you continue to cook food in the soup  the winter melon becomesmore and more infused into the soup  closer to the end  the employees cut pieces of the edge of the winter melon into the soup  i honestly could have drank the whole soup haha the veggies were fresh  if you check in you get free icecream  staff were extremely friendly  they accept card  interior is very beautiful  i would definitely come back to try their other stuff  since it's not ayce  expect it to be on the pricier end 
i love niu pot for multiple reasons  the decor  the great service  and most importantly the quality of food  niu is definitely an instagram friendly restaurant  from their suspending  twinkling lights to beautiful black booths contrasting the white tiled walls; not to mention even the food presentation is on point  specifically the barbie beef  my favorite thing about hotpot is a good  hearty broth that is more than just powder msg with water  i can appreciate a broth that resembles a traditional chinese soup enjoyed at home  meaning less additives and requiring good ingredients and time  niu definitely captures this in their broths  especially the winter melon broth  yes  it's $25 for one pot but it is definitely worth it because you're getting quality soup that's delicious and good for you  i drank practically the whole pot by myself because it was that good  i digress from the soup     the barbie beef ($18) is composed of short rib wrapped around a naked barbie  not only is it esthetically pleasing to the eye  but it's also very fresh and good  i also highly recommend trying their homemade pastes   i got the sampler and i loved each and every paste (fish  shrimp  cuttlefish  beef  pork&mushroom)last thing i wanted to give credit to is the amazing service staff  their english may not be perfect but they are willing to help and do their best  they consistently checked on our pot and helped cut up the winter melon for us towards the end of the meal  they also came by and parted the blood residues that float to the top; i've never had any server do that for me at any hotpot restaurant! tldr  niu pot isn't an ayce so don't compare the prices; hotpot is a relatively pricy meal but at least you'll get better quality food here  order the winter melon broth  barbie beef  and homemade paste sampler!
niu pot is absolutely fantastic! i'm a bit of a hotpot fanatic and have tried many  many different hotpot places yet this has to be my favorite yes  it is pricier than the ayce hotpot places  but the ingredients are so fresh  nothing is frozen  the fish balls and the beef balls are rolled on site  the vegetables and meats are some of the highest quality and freshest i've had in any hotpot places  the food is more than five stars already i came for the winter melon hotpot which was to die for  hotpot cooked in a winter melon? what's not to love? the broth is fresh and light and my favorite part is drinking the soup after  when it has all of the flavors from the meats and vegetables you cook in it the house sauce is also amazing and tastes great with the beef i'll definitely be back to try the pumpkin hotpot and to have the winter melon one again!
environment is beautiful & clean  good music and pretty comfortable seat  servers are nice  but  if you are here for the quality of food  you will get disappointed with the portion size ( paper thin beef  lamb) flavor is ok  you can much "thicker" slide from little lamb 小肥羊 than here  everything else is ok  just like other hot pot place  we ordered chicken pot & oxtail with tomatoes pot  it's alright not too impressive with the soup base finally yelp check in gave us a cup of free greentea icecream  to reduce the disappointment  sorry  no more coming back to you niu  overpriced & avg quality! flushing offers much better choice !if u plan to come  it was not like how it used to be  (like 2 weeks ago)
this place is out of the world! worth the trip out of manhattan!the name & photo does not do its justice  if you like seafood  the french lobster bisque broth for some hot pot action! it is a must try! it sounds boring & cliché but it first came with a table side flambé of lobster chunks and jumbo halves of shrimps in garlic & herbs! so tasty! while we enjoyed the sautéed crustaceans  the bisque was being prepared with the heads  when we were done with the shrimps & lobsters  the server brought out the bisque and poured into the hot pot  then we began the hot pot with whatever sides we ordered  this was one genius & delicious 3 in 1 pot!the other must get was the winter melon hot pot  this would make the best tastiest soup or leftover at the end of the night  the melons soaked up all the essences of meats & veggies that we did hotpot with  mmmm mmmm mmm! the service was great too! they helped you with the cooking for the lobster flamé part  the only flaw  and i'm not going to ding them  was that they didn't have a decent corkscrew to open wine with  & one of the server or maybe the hostess brought a beer bottle opener  ;) there is always room for improvement 
i would say this is a taiwanese style restaurant!i felt like i am at taipei nowtoday i ordered salted pork chop over rice it taste good  not too salty like other chinese restaurants here in flushing  they are now serving the lunch special now  less than $10 you get a pretty good deal and a set!  i added $2 5 for shrimps(3pcs) and they are so fresh! nice will come back and try the hot pot 03 01 2018 the 5th time check inadded some photo for foodies )
reservation made for 7 30 pm for a party of 4fri eveningwe ordered the winter melon hot pot and several dishes from their bbq menu  bbq beef tonguepork jowlchicken wingslambfishoyster in lemon sauceoyster in chinese scallion saucehot pot winter melon basebarbie beef seaweed knotsfrozen tofufried tofu skintaiwanese qq noodles  shrimp with headvegetable plate (nappa cabbage  pumpkin  string mushroom  lettuce)shrimp with headservice was good   we had to flag the staff down a couple times since they were busy but they did make sure to come back to check on you   they made a sauce for you but also have a sauce bar with multiple sauce options for you to make very spacious  not overly loud (really good hip hop music) i didn't leave or wake up overly thirsty   my fellow yelpers knows what this means   this is on par (for me) with mr  hotpot (my favorite hotpot restaurant) 
the dining experience was really awesome! the food is amazing and the servers are really nice! after reading the reviews i thought it will be a so so experience  however  it was actually way better than what we expected! highly recommended to people who love hot pot
we came for the hot pot because our usual spot had a really long line  this place had no line and looked to be fairly new so we have it a shot  the hot pot soup choices were interesting because you could get a japanese pumpkin one and one in a whole watermelon however other than the cool factor  the soup was that flavorful  the presentation for the meats and veggies was nice unfortunately the veggies were wilted and there was a lot of meat in each order  we ended up getting some bbq as an appetizer and they were both way better than the main attraction hot pot  the only other saving grace was the free custard dessert we got at the end which was pretty tasty  the free ice cream we got was just regular vanilla so although i would normally rate a one star  this place gets two for the bbq and the free custard dessert 
we came here on a weekend for dinner and we didn't really need reservations  it can accommodate  big groups and it was very spacious  beautiful led lights hung from the ceiling  great for using that as a background for pictures for a group of six  we ordered two pots  spicy broth (something i will won't get again  way too spicy  you can't really enjoy your food while gulping down water) and the japanese pumpkin crab broth (so good  definitely a must get  the soup itself was amazing  sort of creamy and brothy  hit the right spot for a cold windy night  brought out the right flavors out when you dumped all the food in  at one point  i was just drinking the soup)  the watermelon juice was really refreshing  but one pitcher could only fill up 4 glasses one caveat was that the music they had on the speakers were too loud  i couldn't hear the person across from me  we were basically all screaming 
overpriced for average hot pot   all the dishes are small sized   for a table of 3 we spent $95 and were still hungry   we ordered beef chuck  beef tendon  another beef  lamb  3 diff veggies  6 skewers  $15 japanese crab pumpkin soup   was expecting the soup to come in a pumpkin like the other photos we saw but it didn't   staff was not very attentive   had to ask 2 diff times for refill of water when everyones glasses were empty   the bowls for sauce are also very small   would not return 
i stopped by for a late lunch here on a saturday  it was around 4pm and they still had the lunch menu out which was nice  i like how most of the lunch sets come with soup  the price was good  but like some reviewers mentioned the cut of meat wasn't great  there was a larger amount of fat on my grilled pork than expected  some pieces  were all fat that i had to spit them out  the flavor of the grilled pork was good though  the order came with a small salad and a bowl of broth  the broth had large chunks of daikon and pieces of pork  the broth was lightly flavored and complemented the grill flavor of the dish  please be aware that the dish comes with kimchi on the side of the rice and it is moderately spicy  the kimchi is on the bed of rice so if you do decide to pick it all out like i did the top layer of your rice may be a little spicy from kimchi residue  the decor on the inside has a ceiling with lights strung  we came during the afternoon when most of the seats were empty (interior is rather large)  but i bet it is gorgeous and full of life at night  the hide of the cow pinned up along the wall was disturbing  i must admit  the bathrooms were clean and the staff speaks english  i would maybe come back to try something else on the menu 
really enjoyed this place was worried that meat cooked in watermelon would taste funny but it was delicious   the staff was friendly and helpful when ordering   i would definitely recommend this place as i will be going back myself to try different things
love this hot pot ! another expected experience! the waitress are all so nice and thoughtful! love the interior design as well  lighting fixture is awesome
best  hotpot  in queens  (non spicy)yup  i said it  even though there's an abundant amount of hotpot restaurants in queens  this tops them all  reason? easy for parking  comfortable seating  high ceilings  decent prices  fresh food  attentive service  good beer selection  oh did i mention they sell yakitori (bbq skewers) also?get  winter melon pot  seafood  fatty beef  anything with "home made" label on it  because they really make it in houseavoid  barbie short rib fatty beef   okay maybe just get it once  do it for the 'gram!for spicy hotpot in queens  shift over to spice world instead  you will not regret it 
the lunch menu posted looked so good that we decided to come here for lunch on a saturday  the pictures on their lunch menu look very enticing but the food didn't match my expectations  the portion was skimpy for the protein  i did expect more for the price i paid  the service was also very lacking  we had to flag them down for every little thing including asking for utensils  asking for them to take our order  asking where is our food  etc  it's quite annoying to feel like you're forgotten  we were going to order dessert but we were so turned off by the service and they didn't bother to ask if we wanted dessert  nice decor but i don't think i'll be back 
awesome hot pot! it's fairly new restaurant  although its slightly pricier than other hot pot restaurants i've been too  i found the quality of ingredients to be so much better  we got half spicy broth and half beef  the spicy broth was super spicy! do not underestimate it  i have a high spice tolerance and i felt the heat  they offer veggie and seafood combo if you want to get a bit of each or just order individual servings of everything  service was great! will be returning!
good quality  good environment  and good service  a little pricier than other hot pot place
we tried niu hot pot for lunch during the winter and it was a great experience   their winter melon hot pot is unique and amazing   winter melon is considered a health food and good for your complexion   the soup itself was delicious and hearty   the vegetable and mushroom combo was great as were the beef and lamb add ons we ordered   the meal was very satisfying and the staff cut up the melon for a friend who was recovering from an accident   nice layout and decor as well   would recommend for business lunch and hanging out with family and friends in the evening 
saw some reviews and came to try their winter melon shabu shabu which turn out to be pretty good   very spacious restaurant and no rush to made you eat and go   presentation of foods looks nice and clean but only the seafood platter is not attractive enough which is a little disappointing 
one of the most underrated hotpot place in flushing! this place is definitely my favorite of all that i have tried so far! the restaurant is clean with friendly staff  sometimes service is a bit slow but due to the packed amount of people coming in to eat at the same time  i always crave and get my cravings satisfied with the lobster hotpot  the server would light the pot and cook the lobster in pieces and shrimps in front of you  let you enjoy the products then return to add broth into the pot for the following hotpot portion  best broth ever mixing with the juice coming from the previous lobsters and shrimps that were cooked in the same pot i always enjoyed ordering a side of pumpkin to put in the broth first and made it a bit sweeter; pumpkin is actually very good in hotpot! at least at this location it is  the beef were fresh and worth what you pay for! buy hotpot is definitely on top of my list to share with people when they come to town to visit!!
i got the bbq pork over rice lunch   my wife got the marinated beef over rice  pork was quite delicious and the beef was cooked right   both meal came with kimchi which was quite spicy   the lunch special came with a salad and winter melon soup  the soup by itself was a bit bland  but with the pork and rice it was actually quite a good balance  we also got some skewers  chicken  lamb  squid  beef tendon and sausage   i really enjoyed the squid and sausage  the beef tendon were about a bit soft and almost fat like   overall  good experience  the ambience was very modern  the lighting was unique 
try their new lunch menu which is pretty good i had grilled steak over rice  the steak is tender and juicy and only 9 dollars  i think it's worthy and will try other item next time!
my rating is on the new lunch set   this is my first time in this restaurant   i don't usually go to hot pot restaurant but saw their new lunch set menu and decided to try them decor is beautiful with high ceiling  spacious with comfortable seating   lunch sets (1) mini seafood steam tower lunch set $9 95   4 stars   come with 3 steam trays  first with 2 large shrimps  corn and okra  second with a few large green mussels and a few clams (my kid kept saying the clams were really good)  third with a very delicious winter melon soup   it also came with a bowl of minced pork on rice and a small dish of kimchi   (2) grill steak lunch set $9 75   4 stars   come with a grill steak on rice  salad  a pot of winter melon soup and a small dish of kimchi   the steak was grilled perfectly  char on the outside and rare inside   the meat is a bit chewy but full of flavor   would recommend to add a bit of sauce over the rice     (3) my lunch set happened to the best of all three  steam meatloaf lunch set $6 75   5 stars   omg  the meatloaf is the best i ever had   it was so tender  better than my mom's    it also comes with a small dish of steam vegetable  a bowl of rice  a pot of yummy winter melon soup and a small dish of kimchi   i did not have a chance to try the kimchi as my kid ate it   my only suggestion is to change the rice   it was a bit mushy drinkwe were served with a glass of warm water  my first time but it was helpful after coming in from cold weather lime winter melon drink $2   4 stars dessert   ordered mango sago pomelo 杨枝甘露   not the best with very little mango flavor   i guess it is the wrong time to order this dish in march   we were charged $6 50 regular price even though it should be $4 50 on the lunch menu   the spoons were just too small   next time will try the milk custard instead service was good and bathroom was clean and big will definitely come back to get the lunch set again   may even come back to try other things on the menu 
a warm and cozy hotpot place for the winter  the atmosphere was peaceful with light music  servers were very attentive and food was on point 
i was very interested by their wintermelon pot  but in my opinion   it was not impressive  this place is very expensive compared to other hot pot places that i have been to in flushing area  for 2 people dinner  our bill ended up close to $100  we only order the following items the winter melon pot  $25 for soup base  over priced  beef  lamb  scallop  fish fillet  spinach  fish tofu  mushroom  spam  plum juice and a beer 
my favorite hotpot place in flushing  the wait on weekends are around 20 30 mins at peak time  they have multiple options for the pot including the well known winter melon hotpot also the watermelon hotpot which both are served with soup inside the melons  i have yet to try the watermelon hotpot because i just love the winter melon pot so much! they have a lot of hotpot ingredients to choose from  one of my favorite is the shrimp paste and the fish roe ball  at the end of your meal you could request them to cut the winter melon in the hotpot for you and it taste amazing  they also have options to order the sewers which they make in a open grill that you can see from your table  the service is great and their decorations are always amazing 
environment  very clean and spacious   a bit walk from 7 train  but it was worth it food  the broth is really tasty  full of flavors  they have a lot of items for both hotpot and bbq   all of the food is clean and fresh service   staffs are friendly  and they filled up the water and broth without customer asking for it which is a huge bonus price  it's a bit pricey  we spent around $36 each for a party of 4  but regarding to the freshness and the cleanness of the food  the price is totally acceptable 
i had to come back for the seafood hotpot!! it is to die for   the lobster and shrimp are cooked with butter and fixings  then you get to enjoy the lobster!! but wait there is more!! the servers ladle  in the seafood broth that was cooked in other shells   it made the broth taste like lobster bisque!!!  it was creamy and velvety! we also got the mango pancake which was yummy
i get it  a chic version of a hot pot restaurant with its roots in tradition and culture  and its branches in modern refinement  for what this place is  it is executed well  fresh foods  good service  stylish decor complete with leather tufted booths and cowhide wall art all complement each other well  take away the tabletop burners and one would think s he were in a williamsburg tapas restaurant couple things that stood out 1) reservations accepted2) meat fish shrimp etc balls are all made in house  it is not the frozen stuff you find in the chinese markets 3) in addition to hot pot  there are also bbq options and something called a "steam pot "why not a 5 star rating?1) prices are too high  i get that high(er) end dining comes at a cost  but at the end of the day  we're talking about flushing  where amazing food at low prices is damn near a constitutional right  $20 for broth to be cooked in a melon  or $5 for 1 3 ear of corn is a huge no no 2) there is a 2 credit card per table limit  poor business practice overall  but especially if you're charging niu pot's prices 
5th time coming here  it's getting worst! the first time i came here i left a very good comment  because food was very good! now i'm changing it  pork combination all fatty meat! small portion and expensive! take at least 30 mins for the order  all meat r not fresh! will not come back 
this place is a bit off the main spots but is walk able as soon as you arrive the decor is very modern and americanized (tiles  high ceilings  wooden tables and metal chairs (couch if seated by the wall) service staff was friendly to us   they handed us 2 pages of list  of items that we want to eat but during the dining i felt like i was forced to order (meaning they were overselling me the products)   had to ask the waitress to add more soup half way   (edit  early when we arrived by 6pm it was less crowded but after 7 30 pm it got busier and staff were less attentive) price is a bit steep   but is for the experience   i didn't order the wintermelon (extra $20 plus $3 per person)  since it was 2 of us   we just order the spicy numb soup base to start ($3 per person)   soup arrives  hot oil floating with red hot chilly but is not that spicy at all   flavorful soup that has plenty of herbs in it then we order 3 types of meat (lamb  pork butt and rib eye meat)   the quality of the meats are freshly cut and tasty!   prices were about $ 9 to $ 14 per dish (edit  meat arrived freshly cut  but i don't think it was worth for about 10 slices of meat per dish   even tho it taste good  but i feel like the cost is a tad high) side orders are a must!  veggies  tofu  fish ball  mushrooms (ordered 5 sides were about $3 to $4 each)   they were pretty good (edit  but not worth to pay $ 4 for 5 pcs of a small amount of veggies) there were also offering a grilled squid dish if you check in on yelp  ig or fb   but i didn't enjoyed it because it was  a bit too salty for me   (edit   the dish is made to order and usually you'll be able to see one of the chefs cooking in the center stage   i just wish they put a little bit of sauce instead of just splashing it and cook it) for 2 people we paid about $ 70 total   (not including drinks  drank only water)did we stuffed ourselves? yes  was it good? yes (edit   but not for the price) would you go back again? (maybe with a bigger group to order more) compare to other hot pot places what would i say? (clean  spacious  friendly and good quality food compare to those unlimited ones) (edit) i personally i am spoiled by the flushing cheap eats  but this places makes it a upscale "a la carte" dining experience   each dish cost $$ and it adds up  spicy broth was not super numb enough for me but good for americans (you can request for a hotter level i guess) 
great hot pot place in flushing  their watermelon pot and pumpkin pot are amazing  they have great hot pot  barbecue  and dessert  where else can you get all of these from one restaurant!? and they are not pricy!i'm very glad i've been here 
i ordered food from bbq only  though i see many people ordered hotpot grilled oyster was phenomenal   the cook washed and brushed away sand outside of the shell very carefully  then placed on the grill   i tried the oyster in garlic with lemon juice only  its fresh and so yummy   definitely recommend  must try!bbq meat  squid taste the same in pepper and herb  but fresh and cooked just right 
it appears that management has been reading the horrid yelp reviews  service was definitely not an issue for us on this sunday evening at 6 p m food  we ordered many items  but the things that really impressed us were the handmade fish balls and handmade beef balls  the fatty beef was okay  it was just displayed in a way that made the plate appear to have more beef than it actually did  actually  all of the items were displayed to "look pretty" with little substance service  staff here is actually quite responsive (perhaps due to prior terrible yelp reviews)  decor  the induction system is pretty smart   you'll have to try to burn yourself now  i like how tables are placed in a sparse manner   it's refreshing for flushing  the ventilation system could use a little work  though 
staff were friendly  we got a spicy pot   not too spicy   and a winter melon  veggie mushroom combo  seafood combo  drunken live shrimp  cuttlefish balls nice and fluffy    rib eye beef was very good  also enjoyed the refreshing kumquat lemon drink and grilled items 
avid hotpot fan  extra watermelon enthusiast  so when i walked by the restaurant and saw that they had watermelon hotpot  i was baffled and instantly wanted to try it   came in with my family and was not impressed  25 dollars for the watermelon broth that comes in an actual watermelon but the broth was bland and did not have any taste to it  if you are imagining a sweet watermelon flavor  you imagine wrong because it was not like that at all  we ordered razor clams  squid  fish paste  shrimp paste  their various beef dishes and all in all i was not impressed  yes some of their items seem to be handmade such as their shrimp and fish paste but it didnt have much flavor too  everything was really bland  except their watermelon juice that you get with the watermelon broth  it was not bad  service   the servers were all nice people   but i could not hear them over the loud speakers  and it was frustrating because it was not even that packed ( about 6 tables ) and there was 3 servers  and we constantly had to ask for water  ask them to refill certain things at the sauce station which was sooooo empty  it's like they forgot all about the sauce station   overall  their service needs improvement  atmosphere; they blast american music but do not speak an ounce of english  conclusively  i would not recommend this place 
the pot was great   lobster was so fresh and i like the way they cook the oyster。also the meat is thick than other hot pot。if u order the lobster pot，they will give u alots of vegetables and mushrooms  just side order a beef  and it enough  much cheaper than i sought
food came out one at a time  basically ate each dish as it came out with a group of 5  kept getting our orders wrong but hey we got a free dish that they didn't put on the receipt  i used to like this place but i wouldn't recommend to anyone anymore
this is one of my favorite hotpot restaurants in flushing  they have all the sauces you'll need unlike some places that doesn't have sha cha sauce or peanut sauce  their famous pot is the melon pot which they make a soup out of  the soup base is a little bit pricier but in the end it's a good meal 
now  introducing the watermelon  your new shabu shabu pot! or honeydew  whichever you choose have some fun with the drunken shrimp and scare the living hell out of your beloved ones  every dish at this restaurant is remarkably memorable  and tasty at the same time  i suppose that can be hard to do  the herbal stew and the spicy soup both finished first and now i have to order the yin yan style again  sheesh i have to say  i got the sense of high quality meat and fresh veggies at this restaurant and i would gladly come back for another feast extravaganza  oh  and also the watermelon juice  yum 
my favorite hotpot place in flushing  yes  better than mr  hotpot  reason? first of all  it's healthier food  the soup taste lighter than any other places  but still yummy  you know what i mean  no msg flavor  and i love their sauce bar  a lot of choices  and all sauces are thick  you can tell they didn't add in water like other places do  the veggies look very green and fresh  other than the food  i like their decor too  super chic and the high ceiling lets you feel very relaxed  the desserts are awesome  definitely worth to try  the only suggestion i have is  maybe they can turn the music down a little bit  so that i can actually hear what my friends say when they sit next to me lol
food poisoning!three of us went 10 28 night and we all ended up diarrhea from last night to today  doh should check the food quality of this hot pot restaurant  if you want end up with diarrhea  go to this restaurant!or if you want a quick way to lose some weights with out concerning paying $$$  go there!
niu pot is highly recommended dinning place  artistic presentation  fresh food  friendly service  modern ambience and seasonal music  a great place to have dinner for family and friends!
hot pot at its finest at this quite expensive establishment   instead of using a traditional pot to hot pot  you have a choice of using a half hallow melon or watermelon  a quite unique experience you cannot find anywhere else   this will cost you an additional $20 + $2 a person  and don't forget the food too   there was two of us and our bill came out to about $125 including tax and tip   the fish balls they have are made fresh i think  and so are the beef balls that my friend ate   the food is pretty fresh but i don't know if it justifies the premium   the table set up is a bit not conversation friendly  the table was a bit long   my friend seemed kind of far away lol 
my first time visit and very satisfy with the food   i love the ambience and design of the restaurant  i didn't order the melon soup base because my friend said it was just plain soup and it was $20 plus $3 per person for the melon   i was also looking for something spicy   they provided us with premix house dipping sauce which wasn't bad   the soup base wasn't bad but typical with other hotpot restaurants   i love the melon drink with a twist of lime and it served me well since it was a non drinking night for me i ordered a little of everything   i loved the cuttlefish  squid  shrimp balls  and especially their rib eye   everything was al carte and very fresh  free grilled squid with a yelp check in the only reason this restaurant didn't get a five star review was because their waitress ran after me for tips   when did america become a country where gratuity is required and your wait staff will chase you down for tips?   however  i did put the meal on my cc and i thought a way to help the wait staff by leaving 20% of gratuity in cash   one of the other wait staff took the bill and cash and one of the co worker ran after me for tips which i thought was disgusting and rude   i should have asked for my money back for such disrespect   she should have check with her co workers before chasing down a customer    only chinese place does something so embarrassing with no self respect   conversation with the waitress waitress  wait wait     me  turned around i thought i forgot something at first   waitress  you forgot to leave me a tip? showing me the cc receiptme  no  i didn't put anything down because i left you cash and the other guy took it waitress  really   who was it? ( she thought i was lying)me  the guy with the hat and tattoo and you should check with himwaitress  in disbelief   she walks  away
love the service and the winter melon soup  clean and comfortable seating  everything is super fresh  price reasonable as well  you don't really need to use much sauce and can still enjoy the food this is definitely no 1 on my hotpot list 
heard about the wintermelon hot pot  and came here to see what all the fuss is about  we arrived before 6 30 on a saturday night   and we need to wait for about ten minutes before we get seated (the waitress did get us a menu while we were waiting ) the restaurant is pretty small compared to other hot pot restaurants  so if you come with more than four people   you may consider making reservations  the wintermelon is placed in a pot  and you cook everything in the wintermelon  after you are done  the waitress would cut up the wintermelon for you to eat honesly   other than how cute the wintermelon looks in pictures   the food quality is just the same as other hotpot places in flushing  the broth in the winter melon is good   but not worth the $20 + $3 head   the electric stove  however  is more powerful than other places  we often need to lower it so that the broth wouldn't spill  our bill came to $40+ per person  which is more than ayce hotpot places  and we didn't order a lot of food 
i tend to usually go to hotpot restaurants a couple of times before i decide to leave a review based on their consistency  the past few times i've been here the winter melon soup base has been great! this is my third choice if i'm looking to have hotpot  but if i'm feeling a great tasting soup base  this is the place i'm going to come to  the quality of the meat is also up to par with other hotpot places in flushing  the only reason this modern hotpot restaurant would a lose a star from me is because the service is extremely slow  if you're at a hotpot restaurant  you want to get your uncooked food fast so you can start cooking  they also never speak to you again after you order food  the only time you'll see them is if you scream across the restaurant to ask for water  i enjoy dining here very much and it would be great to see an improvement in that 
i've always had mixed feeling about hot pot places   they never seemed to live up to my expectations  i did enjoy this place as it was unique in the sense that they used a winter melon as the hotpot (literally why i came)  the food was decent   they have pre made sauces as well as a sauce bar for you to whip up your own unique sauce  the service was slow and the staff didn't seem as helpful to my table of four  it took them a while to come refill our cups  help us cut our melon and it was annoying that some of the staff tried to talk to us in chinese   which isn't the dialect you understand  overall  an okay experience   unique and fun but rather pricey for that winter melon 
if you live near flushing you probably will try every place once   this was one of those places we tried came here with my wife her friends   we got here early so we didnt have to endure what some yelpers had encountered food  mediocre  not the worst hot pot place  quality wise   decor or not most the meat plates were slices of meat on top of raw vegetable to give the illusion that you got more than 6 slices for your 8 dollars   good thing they have cheap skewers to fill you up ambience  warm interior  high ceiling  well ventilated   good stuff service  terrible  first hot pot place where they dont add broth or even offer   server was confused which skewers were ours   saw one of the servers save unused vegetables from another table  yeah you can imagine where its going  back your plate this business going for maximum profit at customers expensive  good business model but cant hire smart enough employees to mask it 
service and food   excellent soup is sweet without msgquality of meat is high gradecustomer service   all waters and waitresses are so nice
we ordered spam meat  but instead of that  the waiter gave us something else we didn't order my friend found a black short hair in the sauce!!!!!! that was so disgusting!!!!!!! the price is high  and the sauce you have to ask them to refill again and again  because every time they only give you a little  and you cant choose the sauce  it's not self service  they only have sesame and soy sauce  the bbq oysters came when we almost finished everything  when we check out  we were told that the bbq chef and waiters' tips are separate  will never go again!!!
the beef here is top quality prime beef and is super good  this isn't an average hot pot with run of the mill ingredients   i also don't see why everybody complained about the sauces when they bring a sauce station to your table  there's no need for self service it's in a great location and within a 5 minute walk to the main street train station  you also can't go wrong if you get the winter melon hot pot   i noticed almost every table had them and there's a reason  the broth is unique and adds flavor to the meal   i'll probably be back during the cold months also i don't know why people complained about prices  my group spent about 50 00 each  including tip  and we wobbled home with happy full stomachs after what seemed like twenty plates of ingredients 
me and my family love hot pot  unlike any others hot pot place too much msg  niu pot is the best way to eat in healthy and happily  my toddler also love the hot pot soup  finally we can all eat together the same pot  melon and seafood pot is our favorite  live seafood steam in front of your table  waiter will tell you when is the best time to eat  great hot pot experience here  sure will come again 
omg!!! don't know where should i start?! my hubby and i are total foodies so when we found out that there's this new hotpot place in flushing  we just had to try it out! we went in with four other friends and got so much food!!! i really like the idea of the 冬瓜盅 hotpot with the 走地雞  i had never even heard of doing hotpot with neither things and it was awesome  the favors were so rich and yummy   the dishes made my tummy happy!!! they also have 西瓜盅 hotpot  when we first saw it we were like "what?!" but we saw a few tables getting it and they seem to be really enjoying them so we will try that out next time we go  also when you order the 西瓜盅 hotpot it comes with watermelon juices!!!the decor is very chic and modern  also very clean (very important to me since i'm a clean freak)! the foods are all very fresh  love their freshly made shrimp balls  beef balls and the usda prime beef!!!even though this restaurant is still very new  it was jam packed when we went last night  this is the new happening hotpot place in flushing!oh  i also like the fact that you feel so roomy and comfy in there having hotpot and their ventilation system is really good with high ceiling so you don't leave smelling like hotpot!!!i always try to end my meals with something sweet  they have this 雙皮奶  omg!!! must try   so darn good!!! i am obsessed and i know i will be craving it  just so delish!!! yum yum!!!we travel and eat everywhere and i always read tons of reviews but i never really do them  hubby does  i am just too lazy    i'm writing them a review because i can't believe all the negative reviews here  gotta give them a shout out  especially since i fell in love with their 雙皮奶   
walking by a brand new establishment with big open glass and seeing the faces of satisfaction  why not give it a shot  this here  a hidden gem in the abundance of authentic and nothing short of amazing food in flushing  what this place brings to the realm of the  asian cuisine mecca  is simply refinement and thought  it's as simple as serving high quality ingredients with an atmosphere of forward fashion  it brings new light into a world of hole in the wall places where you can proudly bring a out of towner and say  "yea this is my hometown " it raises the bar for what flushing is known for like many other new establishments that are popping up all over this neighborhood  now onto the moneymaker  a la carte style hot pot  top quality ingredients  amazing bbq items(weird for a hot pot place but a must try   trust)  and great service (few kinks here and there that i'm sure will be worked out once they got more time under their belt)  tried the winter melon special and the chicken broth was clean and flavorful  the meats were exceptional  i can't tell you how many times i've been to a hot pot place and the meat was frozen  mediocre  and i'd have to think twice about under cooking it  but the meat here was good enough for a meat snob like me to probably eat raw  the bbq items were a surprise  in a ever so good way  i didn't know what to expect from it but satisfaction was achieved  the items were served in a tapas style small plate form bursting with umami  from the squid  beef tongue  oysters and prawns  i would come back here just to eat the bbq items the direction this new hip spot is on  the wait time for prime time is going to be brutal  i'm glad i found it and i'm glad it's not that well known yet because i'm a fan  stay fat mother suckers 
nice new place for hotpot  it was their innovation that drew me there  they put broth in winter melon watermelon squash then put it into a pot  as if you are having hotpot with a melon as your pot  food is a bit on the small side  their sauces are pretty good tho  instead of traditional sesame sauce with too much water like other places  they blended a special 9 flavor sauce with a sesame sauce base  this place offers good chinese barbecue too  worth a try!!
when i first heard about the winter melon hotpot  i thought it sounded weird and somewhat gross  however  after having tried it at this restaurant  i admit it changed my mind  the winter melon is not an actual melon  but more akin to a pumpkin and daikon  the melon hotpot tasted okay after the soup was cooked  but can't say it was worth the extra $20  the next time i come  i plan on ordering their normal hotpot place had a modern atmosphere  which i really liked  the hotpot soup was fresh with little or no msg recommend prime beef  beef tongue  fried tofu  corn  mushrooms  vegetables  lambs have a particular odor  so check with those on your table before dipping a piece in the soup i also recommend you order a small portion first and add on more as you eat 
tried this new hot pot place which is quite different from all the rest  not a very big place but it's special is a winter melon hotpot which they put in a whole chicken cut up which makes the soup hearty  taste like homemade soup  definitely going again  one girl named nicole did wonderful job in making us feel comfortable as we waited bcuz at first she told us it's about 1 2hr wait but turned out to be an hr food was good and satisfying  they have this chief chef cooked food specials steak was was good  oysters with the xo sauce was super tasty 
expensive and a total rip off  they come in very small portions for $5 6 and the meat is $13 20 in very small portions  i don't recommend this place at all  came here today with a party of three and got the pumpkin broth  1 fish tofu  1 beef rib eye  1 spinach  1 enoki  1 crab meat and 1 fish ball and the total came out to $80 and wasn't even full  save your time and go somewhere else that's an all you can eat hot pot buffet  i hope they shut this piece of trash place down  p s  they buy everything from chung fat supermarket down the block and their overpriced menu items they charge you is crazy since everything in that supermarket is cheap 
delicious   fresh  fun and an immaculate place! service was attentive  beef very good quality   a bit pricey but it's worth it!  you get what you pay for   the water melon and winter melon hot pot were super fun and unique!yep  it was my first time at niu  
the main reason i'm only giving 3 stars is the service at niu which needs to improve and improve quickly   flushing is a hustling and fast paced environment with countless restaurants and great service (not just food) is required if a restaurant wants to be in business   that being said     the issues with service was not just me but two other separate patrons as well    upon being seated the waiter brought me a lunch menu and after taking my order and realizing that i might be interested in the regular menu he brought it and asked if i wanted to hold off on my original selections    i said yes to wait   i chose a few items from the regular menu and told the waiter i wanted to replace the new items with what i ordered initially   the guy checked and basically said the order already got put through   i was a bit irked but being that it'd save me money i let it slide   so i just ordered a couple more items and that was it    the food was decent but definitely not so great that i will want to come here again 
the customer service there is bad  we are almost $146  there and paid 15 percent tip there  the waitress told us if we paid cash  we will get $5 discount  so we paid cash in order to get that discount  we already paid $19 for tips  however  the waitress came back to us and told us we did not pay enough tips  we did our calculation and i think we did it right  but we still add $3 more on the tip   however   the waitress still told us that we pad $5 less for the tips       so i told him      u forgot the $5 discount that u said u gave us because we paid cash        how stupid of the waitress in this restaurant  for the $5 tips to make their customers feeling so bad after the dinner and actually it is their mistake on calculation   i will never come back to this restaurant any more please if your restaurant need your customer pay an requested % of the tips  please put the required percentage and amount on the bill      don't ask your customers to do their calculation because not all your customers are good on the mathematics !
first time here  they have a watermelon hotpot that looks very interesting  other than that  it seems to be your traditional hotpot place  hope this place will be good and stay for awhile since i live close to it 
stopped by today and had the beef noodle soup and the flank steak over rice   nice  clean place not much character the prices were good but the quality of the meat in both dishes was really poor   the soup had fatty beef with lots of cartilage and the flank steak dish should have been called grizzle over rice   it was seasoned well but could barely be chewed won't return 
nice chic hotpot restaurant  the wintermelon pot for hot pot is pretty damn cool although it's not a new concept  i can't say it was anything exceptional  hence the 3 stars  but it's got potential and a nice place to bring friends to for something less ordinary  service was fine as well  adequate food and adequate service 
i would give this place a negative 5 star if i could  warnig  come here at your own risk! i've never had to write such a bad review about any business on yell but i'm absolutely adamant about this place!! the staff here are not only clueless and incompetent but the my also lie to patrons in their face about there mistakes  here is our experience today  after waiting for over 30 minutes  one of our party incidentally overheard the hostess giving our table to someone else and telling them to keep quiet about it  when we confronted the staff  a guy with bald head and glasses lied to us and alleged that the other party  who does not have the basic common courtesy to wait for their turn  "made reservations earlier in the day" when the hostess already admitted that she made a mistake! we then requested to speak to a manger  the bald head liar claimed he's the manager!! wow  beware people  the manager at this place is a liar!! they don't have the basic competency to seat the patrons in order but then insults our intelligence by lying about it!!! message to the owner  if you want to stay in business in the competitive flushing market and in this bad economy  you need to hire staff that are at least honest! otherwise  you are wasting all your money spent on advertising and marketing  message to the bald head lying so called manager  don't insult your customer's intelligence and go get another job bc you do not deserve to be in the service industry!! we will also be voicing our discontent to our friends and on other social medias  response to the owner  while i appreciate you taking your time to read and respond to yelp reviews  i can unequivocally reassure you that there is absolutely no misunderstanding or miscommunication between anyone and especially between your manager and hostess  not only did one of our party member clearly heard the conversation in which the waitress told the cutting party to stay at the table and stay quiet after they refused her demand for them to leave the table but i specifically asked the hostess to stay during the entire conversation we had with your incompetent manager  furthermore  there were plenty witness to the entire conversation exchange where your manager pretty much admitted his dishonest conduct  whether you as the owner wants to take affirmative steps to correct and properly train your staff or let them take your business down is completely up to you  but the fact remains unchanged that we caught your staff's lying in action  i have already wasted enough time on this unhappy event 
i wish i can give this restaurant negative grade if i cloud   today is my first  time coming here and it is last time because it was a horrible dining experience here  i wont recommend this place to any of my friend but tell them do not come to this place otherwise you will definitely regret!!!first of all  servers' attitude are extremely rude  we've been seated at a corner when we came in  but at that time lots of tables were empty! since this is our first time coming so me and my friend have no idea how to make a order  and nobody come to us to give a introduction of how to do it   so my friend just put three for each item she wants   because she thought it's going to be very little for one order  agent we done with ordering  one server took our order without confirmed with us  or noticed us how a big is one order and if we order too much cause of it's only for us two!  so when the server brought out so many the dishes on table   we realized we did order too much cause each one comes in a large portion  so we asked them right away is we could get some of the food returned since we didn't touch them and it just came out  we also apologized for the inconvenience  one server told us yes  but there is another server came over  and told us very rudely that we can not return the extra untouched dishes he continued explained that the eggs are all from cans so can't be returned (ridiculous! have you ever heard the whole egg come from a can??? or who can tell me you can eat 3 dish eggs =10 pcs eggs on 1 dish?) i couldn't stand his rudeness and unreasonable excuse so i request to talk to manger or boss  he responded that they were all absent today i was so mad at the time cause of his rude attitude not just because he refused to return the extra food  and the worst is since this happened he never come to our table to check us  non professional at all!!at that time i really want to immediately leave  i don't want to stay anymore!but i don't want my friend embarrassed so i still adhere to eat the hot pot it's not finish yet!second we found the lettuce had a small drain fly on it!!! we couldn't believe what we saw  and it suddenly made us all too sick to continue to eat ! finally  to be honest i have to say this restaurant doesn't taste good at all and some food are not eatable! and the service are horrible! you consume the amount of money and you get service  has serious deviation!i had a 'memorable' dinner today!but i still left a 15% tip  because i don't want other severs lose tips!not recommended!will not come back again!！the flushing have so many places more better better to hotpot than niu pot!
very good taste excellent servers its my first time came to niu pot from yelp i saw so im so excited about this i order the lobster pot love it and they offer me they news said share it to moment u will get free dessert drink，woop nice so i do it right the way taste good the hot pot is amzing they also got bbq too gonna come again for it
came here on a saturday afternoon at 1pm for lunch  and there was no wait for a table for three  upon ordering  i recommend choosing the broth base that comes in either 1) a winter melon or 2) water melon just because it's so much more fun cooking your food inside a melon! the restaurant is not all you can eat  and the quality of the food is decent  what one of the previous review mentioned is true  majority of the staff here are mandarin speakers that does not speak a lot of english  if you are not a native mandarin speaker  and make a request in english the waiter would grab another waiter that does speak english  which can cause a delay in service  the waiters are not rude and our food came in a decent pace  we ordered both raw food for hot pot and grilled food hrough the checklist they provided  and i must say  the beef selection is fairly small  the plate of beer we ordered were in small portion  but it was on top of a huge bed of lettuce to make it look more than it is  one unique thing niu offers aside from the melon pot is that they hand craft all their fish balls  and they have this thing called seaweed rice cake which taste like daikon with pudding texture  i recommend trying it  i have not saw that anywhere else in ny one thing i highly recommend ordering (must try!) is their grilled section on the second page on top of drinks  i understand you're inside a hot pot place  but niu have a bbq grill in the back that can serve their patron as appetizers  try the beef rib slices with their special sauces  the beef rib slices is made medium rare like steak and the sauces pairs very well together  definitely made my tummy a happy place to be if you check in on yelp  you're also provided a free order of grill bbq squid  hooray! the grill squid wasn't anything special  but it was well season  it did took a while for our table to received it  it is one grill squid per table  despite various check ins  our bill came out to be $40 a person  and we were all very full  the ambience inside the restaurant is very modern with wooden bench tables with a hot pot stove in the middle of each table  the walls are white tiles  and the music being played were jazzy christmas tunes  niu is definitely what i consider a more high end hot pot restaurant  but for the service and the ambience you're provided i left as a happy diner and will definitely come back 
niu pot is definitely pricier than the average hot pot place  but i left very full and very happy! we got the winter melon soup  along with an assortment of very fresh meat and veggies  my favorite was the drunken shrimp   so good raw!   and their fish balls  which are stuffed with roe  their modern interior and huge tables makes your dining experience very comfortable   you don't feel as if you're blocked in by mountains of food   but it is a little hard to talk to the people across from you!
the idea of melon pot is great  but it should at least have some decorations for the price i can hear waiter and waitress talking and laughing in chinese  it very unfortunate for customer like be me  because i cannot understand them  the price is high in flushing  but ok compare to other place in the city  but nothing stands out in terms of the service or the taste 
really nothing to rave about   staff wasn't very friendly   food was just ok   didn't understand the melon hot pot   they cut the winter melon and put it in the hotpot with some water on the outside  and soup inside the melon but it was small and deep   couldn't really cook out of it   doesn't look like it was meant for sharing but the price for it for one person is a lot   food selection wasn't great   only thing that was good was that they have a wide variety of beer to choose from 
what is the point of having store hours if you are going to stop serving people an hour before you close? at 11 03pm  on a saturday  my party of two was turned away even though they are supposedly open until 12am 
very bad seating system! and service as well we came here around 6 30pm  and have been told that there is a large group of people are dine in right now  so we need to wait approximate 40mins  we choose to wait  because there is only one group of two people in front of us  after around 30mins  there are two groups of four came in  it looks like the large group is almost done  and we were dying to eat  however  they put the four people in first  because the former large group is using the table that has two stove to fit in 4 people  and for us  they just say wait for the two people table is available  and there are two two people table are getting checks now  alright  after 1 hour and half waiting  we finally got seated  hope the manager will improve the seating system  one star for the contemporary decorate 
really not what we were expecting  our neighboring table found some small flies in their winter melon pot  which i found that disgusting  we left right after  food was pretty fresh  service is mediocre  hope they will provide a better service and be more careful on the food they serve  don't recommend  it's the same as any other place  it's probably the winter melon pot that attracts people 
giving them one star is even too much  i don't understand what the hype is about  came here on a sunday night at 6 00  they told us the wait was 40 minutes  it's been 1h40minutes and we still didn't get our table yet  every single time we went up and asked  she would say 'the next table is yours'  but she also said that to 3 other customers  at the end  we had to combine table with other customers and sat right in front of their bathroom  their food is overly priced and small quantity  service sucks  no smiles and waited 10 more minutes for the menu to come  won't be coming here again  very disappointed * they have pre made sesame sauce for you to dip  and different sauce jars when you ask for it  when the sauce jar doesn't have any more sauce and i asked for a refill  they came back saying there's no more sauces but later on i saw it on another table  *waited 20 minutes for food  they served the wrong meat to my table  when the tray of food came  i asked the waiter where the homemade fish paste is and he clearly did not know  the fish paste does not have any flavor to it  *we ordered the winter melon pot and the bottom was burning  they did not come and add any water to it until we asked 
for a hotpot lover i was excited to try this place but was extremely disappointed  there were not a lot of choices for a non ayce hotpot place  it was expensive and the beef portion was so small but so expensive! we ordered the wintermelon pot and they gave us the smallest wintermelon which made me wonder how 4 people can actually eat out of it  we had to have them give us a bigger one  i def will not be eating here again
3 5 starsthe meats were really nice and tender   the portions are rather small   they place the meat on top of a high bed of lettuce the soup base that we got (herb chicken) was okay veggie portions were good  but seemed like nothing once cooked i go to hotpot mainly for the sliced meats  so i was content   my wife is picky  and she didn't like that they do not have a sauce condiment station   instead  yo get a communal mini bowl of hot oil  and a dry xo   also each person gets a mini bowl of sesame paste  and a wet hot sauce with shallots they grill food for you too on a grill which is in the back of the restaurant service is very good   the place looks nice and clean   the white tiles make it look like you're eating in a bathroom  remarked my mil i would go back    my wife said she will not   so i guess i'll have to bring another girl  haha
the staff is unhelpful  rude  and overall bad  i made a reservation  and showed up 10 minutes before my time  one female staff said they were cleaning up a table for us  then another staffer gave our table away to another party  we then had to wait 30 minutes for a table  nobody came go check up on our table  and while they came to our neighbors to cut up their winter melon  nobody came to offer to cut ours  we then had to complain to multiple people just to get our parking ticket paid for the full 2 hours  even though we wasted 30 minutes since they gave our table away  apparently even though we had 2 cars  our free 2 hours was split into one hour per car  however  they do not mention a car limit at all  their website says there is free parking but it's really not  the garage was also rude  and made us pay for a full hour because we were 2 minutes over our time limit  we were 2 minutes over because we had to wait for someone to come help us 
it was interesting how it was hotpotting in a wintermelon but it was really expensive and there wasn't a lot of food  the wintermelon itself was $20  i don't it was really worth it 
my overall experience was very positive at this restaurant  we came here a few nights ago for  dinner  and was promptly seated location  it was within 5 mins walk from the main street subway station  it is on main st and occupies a fairly sizable section at the street corner so very hard to miss interior  very modern and spacious  super high ceiling  there's plenty of space for everyone  seating  walking  and waiters waitresses  most restaurants try to cram as many tables seats in as little space as possible    service  impeccable    i felt like i was in a michelin star restaurant  the waiter gave us a quick run through of the menu  some recommendations  as well as some specials for the day  all waiters waitresses were very attentive the whole time   changing plates  adding soup (for the hot pot)  refilling water tea   etcfood  hotpot food menu items were very fresh  bbq menu tastes great! i've added some pictures so you can see yourself  desert  you have got to try the milk pudding    it is so good  period  leave some room because you might want a second serving very impressed with this place and definitely coming back!
honestly  i don't understand all the negative reviews for this place  i have to say my experience here was excellent!service a++bbq food a+cleanliness a++only downside is the pricing on certain items such as the rice and udon $2 $4  however  i expected if you simply look at the decor and location  the wait staff was extremely attentive  maybe because it's a slow weekday  if it is busy  it is understandable if the service is a bit slow since the staff might be overwhelmed    our servers changed the plates 4+ times   waiter was not pushy  he suggested that we ordered enough and could order more later if we are still hungry   water pitcher was always refilled  empty plates were cleared away promptlyit was my graduation celebration  so we ordered a bit more  the bill for 4 ppl came to about $170 including tip  i would definitely recommend this place 
good environment  great service  high quality meat  good experience here!! everyone should give a try~~~
it's actually my second time in niu pot   we ordered the winter melon pot  the soup was great and flavorful and it doesn't make me thirsty after eating like other hot pot restaurants do  their beef is definitely high quality，must try!!! i also like their atmosphere and their interior decor  feel like eating in an upscale restaurant in williamsburg  very trendy and classic  the best part is my jacket didn't smell like hot pot after  i guess this is probably because they have very high ceiling  my experience dinning in niu pot was excellent and wish they will open one in the city soon 
the place is clean  and the food was delicious  loved the whole winter melon pot idea  if you're not afraid of beef tongue  get it! they gave us a large amount of it  watermelon juice was fresh and yummy  a bit pricey  and would recommend coming here with more than two people  i would probably come back again for the pumpkin pot with a group of friends  overall pretty good  but service could be better(no tea was served till later after we ordered  and the waitress had to ask again if we had ordered after 10 minutes in putting in the order  took awhile for the raw food to arrive)  overall a 3 5 experience  rounding it up because of the food 
food it's just average  just like any other hot pot places in flushing  service is ok  they dnt have a sauce station tho  u need to ask the servers for sauces which is so inconvenient!!! and it's pricy too for hot pot  i give an extra star for the gimmick n creativity  otherwise this place only worth 1 star to me 
love their winter melon hot pot and all the grill items  we had beef tongue  oysters  and the kaaba  all taste fabulous !! we had awesome experience and great time  definitely coming back and have more of these yummy food 
when it comes to a unique experience for hotpot  this is the place to be  the food taste great and is presented nicely to you  their unique melon hotpot and new seafood steam pot are one of a kind  the pricing is  a little more than your typical hotpot place  but it is worth the price for the taste and experience  i feel comfortable and relax when sitting in this place to eat  there is plenty of room to move around and the circulation is great  my experience here at niu pot has been amazing and would definitely come back again  i recommend anyone who is a hotpot lover to come try out this place  in addition they have some amazing bbq selections fresh off the grill 
in my opinion this is the best place to go for high quality hot pot  true the price is not cheap  but you really get to enjoy the best  lamb and beef are amazingly fresh and tasty  the soup base are innovative yet delicious  service was very good too  the environment is very open and spacious  in contrast to most other hot pot places which are usually crowded  overall  definitely your go to if you wanna high quality hot pot!
on a cold winter afternoon  it's always nice to go for hotpot to warm up  i went here for the winter melon hotpot and had a decent experience  the hype of having a winter melon hotpot had drawn me here  some of the things my friends and i ordered were  cuttlefish  meatballs  squid  mushroom  beef strips  lettuce  some type of glass noodles  and scallops  the food took a little longer than expected to come and the service was ok  it took a while for the waitress to refill our tea and to cut up our melon  overall  decent experience 
i like hot pot so much  i have been to here for so many times  melon pot is interesting but one of my favorite is always spicy pot   handmade dish ball is so good a lot of handmade beverage and special dish you can choose  good service! recommend it 
great food!! their winter melon drink is the best!! you will never find something similar around queens  the place is unique and great food! it is great quality food with excellent atmosphere 
yummy pumpkin hotpot  the beef is good here  love the homemade beef and fish tofu balls  took the leftover pumpkin broth to go! great service and sauce tray 
i can see why this restaurant is fast becoming popular as it is fully packed when i came here  first off  i really love their interiors; trendy and modern rustic  their servers are friendly and helpful  and their signature winter melon broth is definitely a must try  the way they present it is that they serve the entire melon in the pot and as you cook it over time  the broth is becoming more flavorful and you can scoop the melon and eat it  i don't think i have seen it anywhere else  they also serve quality fresh meats here and fresh made meatballs (which makes all the difference in my opinion )  i would also recommend the grilled shrimps skewer and beef tongue skewer  and i also loved their dipping sauce (special recipe indeed) 
the beef was great   the pot is nothing special just a melon pot   all the other food was average but the service is somehow average too   those waiters n waitress never look at you  or the table they look at the wall and walk pass you without notice you are looking at them   even you wave at them   it takes time for them to know that you are looking for them   the handmade shrimp ball was ok   the beef was great   the drunk shrimp portion is way too small    overally is average hotpot place   the day we went   there were a group of ppl that talks really loud n yell at everything that they put into the pot which that makes me alittle annoy   the restaurant is very cold inside   i dont even know where these wind come from?  will try again 
i love this place coz the back ground music always nice  food yammy ^^ will go there again again hahahaha
it's edible  but there are a few kinks to work out  for one  the watermelon juice was a nice touch but it really needs to be cut with some water it's just too sweet and syrupy otherwise  the soup for the watermelon hot pot also needs a good hit of salt  halfway through the meal  the already bland broth took on a sweet flavor  but not in a good way  i left feeling like i needed to eat a bag of lays  i won't be coming back here  there are too many factors working against it for that  out of the way  unfinished flavors  awkward table chair height ratio 
creative ways to hotpot! everything is super fresh! addicting good! different types of beef  seafood and their bbq items are to die for 
i have no idea why there are so many bad comments  niu pot is the best hot pot restaurant in new york i have ever been  most of people complain about waiting tables and seat system  it is normal to wait for the table on weekends  especially waiting for this kind of fancy restaurant  just come earlier and you will have your nice spot to sit  i love their house winter melon!!! creative and delicious!!! i ordered cage free chicken which they recommend it is good with winter melon  super amazing! must try house winter melon juice and plum juice!!! cozy place for traditional cantonese style food  i love it and will definitely come again!!!!
such a pity  this place has so much potential  great food drinks and place itself  but such slow servers who do not speak a lick of english  yes  they give you the menu where you can check off what you want  but how slow can it be putting the orders in the pos and delivering the uncooked food to our table? mind you  the place is a ghost town  there were probably around 3 tables including ours  it took about 30 minutes for our stuff to come out  and it wasn't even all at once  it was one    by one   by one  maybe the service has gotten better after my visit here  i would definitely like to give it a go once more  but i'm going to wait my visit out a bit longer and wait for other people to try it 
idea was cool but services are awful!! food only ok   $$$$$$$$$$$$$ totally not worth the money!
food is a little bit more expensive compared to your standard hot pot place  but you get what you pay for  food is really fresh  dumplings are made in house  and the milk custard dessert is delicious  i order it every time i come 
one star is even too much their service was horrible and the waitresses were unprofessional and rude at first  we were told only to wait for 20 minutes for a party 5  so  we decided to wait  later on  i decided for my dad to join us which was only one more person to the list and we told the waitress  she told us to wait a few minutes and so we did  a few minutes later  another party was seated before us also a party of 6  and we questioned how much longer we needed to wait  the waitress in the front  which i thought of as especially rude  decided to tell us that we had to wait another 20 30 minutes  this was also very rude of them because they did not bother to tell us in the first place and we also had two kids and an elderly waiting  this might've seem okay but this happened on multiple occasions  the whole family was very keen on trying out this new restaurant in town but after multiple occasions of bad seating systems  we decided that this restaurant was not worth the while 
free parking! this is a super plus dinning in flushing! like they say niu pot is the best hot pot in new york  fresh food  nice decor  great service! i am from canton and i must say this is authentic cantonese hot pot  i had a great time with my friends and family in niu pot  highly recommend!!!
poor service! made me so mad! i stand at the front for more than 15 mins  no one asks me if i want a seat or what  at the first min  a guy asked me need help or not then he's disappeared  there were two ladies walked in later than me a girl came up and asked if they need help then ignored me standing up there for more than 15 mins then she left! she left without asking me to get me a seat  after 15 mins  she finally asked me if i need help  i don't understand if it's because i'm wearing casual shirt hoodie sneaker so she thinks i can't pay a lot or what or i look like that young can't afford the meal ?
the winter melon is super small comparing to the other table!!!! and they say it's all the same size     i'm super speechless 
omg！this should be the best hotspot place in ny  even better than mister hotpot  a little pricy but totally worth it  the winter watermelon pot is creative and tasty  i think it's bc of the chicken broth  the beef and veggies r the same as everywhere else  but the soup base makes everything delicious  they have a wide selection of sauce (which i love!) desserts (really good) and soft drinks(and craft beer)  besides  you can order bbq too  i've tried almost every hotpot places in flushing and i definitely recommend this one    only downside  more expensive than average hotpot places 
this is not the first time i have been to this restaurant but it will definitely be the last one! 1st of all  the waitress has no knowledge of the menu  every time we ask about a item on the menu  she's like "oh  it's a new item and i don't know"  2nd  we ordered a drink which was not made correctly  they offered to make a new one  which we agreed  but we did not get the new drink until after multiple requests and finally get it at the end of the meal  3rd  they have a raffle going on and we won a vip card which supposed to give us discount  we ask on 3 separate occasions if the vip card can be use this time and was told it should be ok  but guess what  they refuse the give the discount when we call for check!4th  the waitress refused to validate our parking because we spend $92(it needs to be over $100)  instead of turning down a return customer  wouldn't it be better to ask if customer is willing to order an extra dish or desert to make up the difference?i really don't see a reason why i would want to go back to this restaurant again!!
omg  this place is crazy  we have being waiting for an hour because we were only two people  even there are sits which they said could only give to people with 2 or more  there is no place like here! if it was a huge table for 6 people or more  ok it's fine  but 4 people's table and couldn't let us to sit is ridiculous! so some people behind us don't even have to wait! they really should not do that! if i had the choice i would not even give them a star! horrible!! don't come! i have been using yelp for many years and this is my first review  you know why? cause i can't stand this place!
i wish we had more places like this in san francisco  the winter melon was amazing  we came here with a large group of people  and the staff was very helpful in getting us a big enough table  they were very attentive and helped us order  not only that  but i must have had 1000 bowls of their peanut appetizer  everything is really fresh  they care about hot pot and it really shows  not only that  but they have a great selection of beers which seems rare in flushing  i will definitely make this a regular spot for hot pot  sorry elmhurst!
my new favorite hotpot spot ! the decor is different from your usual flushing scene  as the ventilation here is great so you don't leave smelling like food  haha  the servers are very on point and help is always available if you have questions  the food is delicious  and the pot    the pot is so cool! they have different bases for soup with wintermelon or watermelon as the pot! how cool is that! was a little pricy but overall we had a wonderful experience  )!
food  food quality is not that amazing  i've had much better hotpot places in flushing (i e   fukuoaka  dolar shop  mister hotpot)  where the quality of the meats especially are amazing   the first time i went  i ordered the wintermelon pot because my friends & i figured that would taste better than the watermelon pot  for one  if you are a seafood lover  you will instantly fall in love with the broth  it has a strong fish smell & small dried pieces of baby shrimp (size of a red ant)  also  i am displeased with the sauces they offer  usually i like to create my own dipping sauce  however in this case they made their own  & when i asked for the mixing station (all hotpot restaurants have this)  they brought over a mini tray with very limited selection  if i can't make a good sauce for my food  then i can't enjoy my hotpot  if you are like me & is all about creating the best dipping sauce  this might not be the place for you  service  not that i was not satisfied with service  i felt that they should hire more waiters & waitresses who speak more english  for one  i am a fluent chinese speaker so it wasn't hard for me to order  however  whenever my friend needed anything she'd politely call for the waiter & ask for whatever she needed in english  the waiter then proceeded to stare in a confused way for a good amount of time before saying okay and walked away  shortly after  this waiter brings another waiter who spoke more english than he did  almost all the waiters barely spoke any english  if you do not speak mandarin chinese  i advise to bring a friend who does because majority of the waiters do not speak english uniqueness  i for one  had to try this hotpot place out because i am a big fan of hotpot  this place was unique because it is one of the first hotpot places in flushing that can cook your hotpot inside a wintermelon or watermelon  how cool is that? supposedly the melon cooks with your broth & makes the broth tastes  better (i'm not too sure about that  but sure whatever they say)  although the idea of cooking your food inside a melon is cool  it is actually pretty frustrating  first of all  your melon is small  meaning you can only cook a few pieces of food at one time (literally  like 2 pieces of beef & 2 pieces of veggies) without having the pot overflow  also  as the pot cooks the waiter told us that we can slowly scrape the insides of the melon & eat it  of course  that was also a unique idea  but it didnt taste good  the soup probably absorbed all the flavors from the melon location  in the middle of flushing  near the library (walkable distance)opinion  would i come back? never again  i mean  don't get me wrong  honestly eating out of a melon was a pretty good experience  however  it's good to try at least once for yourself 
something different  came here to try the winter melon pot  exceed my expectation but definitely a bit pricey for the winter melon pot  it is $20 for the pot and additional $3 per person fee for the whole table half way during our dinner  we learn that the waitress can assist to slice the side of the winter melon into the pot to eat  it was quite delicious meat   pork  beef  seafood were very fresh i had a toddler with me during dinner  very attentive waitresses and staff  will definitely come back 
amazing fresh cuts  ask for nicole before u sit for a good time with ur friends and family  esp on a date
by far the best hotpot in flushing but expensive for hotpot  the lobster broth is strange   
best hot pot restaurant in flushing!!! must try the bbq fish  beef tongue  and steak  everything is so fresh  highly recommend this place to everyone 
i visited today for lunch special  this is my first time to try this new hot pot place and i think it's pretty good! the service was pretty good  the waiter and waitress are all very nice  explaining the lunch special combo patiently and also help me to remove some spicy oil and peppers in the spicy soup (i think it's very thoughtful  because i was worry it's gonna be too spicy)  the whole space feel relaxed and clean  the music also not too loud and helped create a nice comfortable mood  the lunch special combo itself was quite nice! well balanced portion of everything  a lot of veggies  some meat and handmade meat balls  a small piece of fish  udon  and i like that even lunch special can have 2 soup base (half and half spicy and non spicy)  i think it's a good deal for a $16 dollar (plus tax and tip is around $20) lunch hot pot overall  i think it's not bad  i would like to visit again!
delicious food  amazing meats  and tasty chinese vegetables  it's nice to find such a good restaurant in flushing  this place opened recently and is well worth the visit  everything is so fresh and i love the look and feel of the restaurants  for the quality of food  it's reasonably priced  i'm looking forward to trying some of the other things on the menu next time i'm in the area!!
overpriced and no better than the hundred hot pot places in flushing  it lacks your own sauce making station  upside is that the steak ribeye is done pretty well from the grill station no i was there total three time  i was there during grand opening days though
i came here with my coworkers total 8 people  it is a little bit wait since this place is so popular  but we ordered drinks and bbq while we are waiting  the restaurant is nicely designed  simple and classic  the best is the meat  excellent  and i like the house shrimp ball as well  it was about $40 average per person  may be a little bit pricy compared to other hot pot restaurants in flushing  but the atmosphere and food quality is better  definitely recommended for people who has a life style and demands quantity food 
we ordered winter melon pot  it's a little expensive but tastes good  not oily  the beef is fresh  the environment is good  no weird smell  no oily floor  dessert is a must try!!! highly recommend!
this was my first time trying hotpot and i decided to try it because all of my friends raved about it  it was my first experience with asian food and i felt very welcomed despite me being non asian   they helped me choose and i loveddd what they recommended me ( winter melon ) and other dishes that i forgot how to pronounce l  i will be coming back when i'm around flushing again
i was very impressed when i found out this hidden gems in flushing  the decor is pretty unique and the restaurant is very clean compared to other hot pot restaurants which i like it a lot  for the food part  we order grilled beef tongue  grilled fresh oyster( chinese style) and sea bass from the bbq section which is super tasty  highly recommended! we also try their signature winter melon hot pot which is very interesting and delicious  this restaurant has already became my favorite hot pot place now 
fresh ingredients  trendy atmosphere  great service! gotta try the winter melon hot pot  awesome!
this place was amazing! their hot pot  obviously the best i've had  but their service was genuine and on point  unlike other places on main or even northern  if you're looking to take people out for dinner or lunch  this place is the go to! i seriously wished i found out about this place sooner  
one of those craving for hot pot night  decided to give a try on this place   average food  average broth with pleasant presentation  unreasonable price but service was good tho 
gloria was a really good waitress  she spoke fluent english and as an abc i really needed that 
not the best hotpot place  first time come here and will be last time here too  bbq beef tongue is not tender and hard to chew! grill fish is very good! quality of the food and the price paid is not equal
this is the best hot pot place in flushing the server are really nice they helped me pack up my to go   my flavor is the melon pot the only store that has this kind of hot pot in new york city   i'll come back again for sure
came here with my family and we ordered the watermelon and winter melon hot pots   the sweet watermelon flavor combined with the broth was delicious   the winter melon soup after the hot pot was also excellent   we also ordered a bunch of side dishes and they were equally delicious   the place is very clean and after dinner  we went to tous le jours next door for dessert!
my husband and i came here for dinner on a friday night  as soon as we entered the restaurant  we felt at home  unlike most of the hotpot places  the decor here is very modern and stylish  which provides a very comfortable and relaxed dining environment  the service was extremely good  it was our first time  so our waiter went through the menu with us  gave us good recommendations when we needed  the food came out quickly  all in good quality  and very fresh  we enjoyed the famous winter melon hot pot  the soup was so delicious and healthy (a big plus)! they have a self serving sauce station  you can go up and make your own sauce  the station is clean and non greasy  the waiters and waitresses were very attentive  they offered to cook the seafood for us since we might cook it for too long  we also ordered some bbq  they were all very tasty  they have a wide selection of drinks too  including the unique winter lemon drink   a must try!  we ended our dinner with a heavenly delicious dessert  called 双皮奶 (milk pudding)  i wished that i did not eat that much  so my stomach would have more room to take in a second serving  we will definitely come back 
all food are very fresh and delicious! very nice and intimate place for friends hang out here!
i was really excited to try this place because of the pumpkin pots and melon pots but then something happened that make me dislike this place  as i was having my meal  one of the waiter brought out more food that my mom have ordered and i don't really know what caused him to screamed out "fuck" really loud while he was placing the dishes down on to the table that was cramped between my table and another table that was next to me  maybe he hit his toes really hard or he hit his crotch but that doesn't matter  you should not scream out something so vulgar especially when you screamed directly at a customer's ear  i've never felt so embarrass at a restaurant ever because after he screamed  everyone looked at my direction and he started limping back into the kitchen  that moment was so awkward that i couldn't even enjoyed my meal anymore because i didn't understand what caused him to scream  this shows that niu pot needs to hire more experienced workers 
the worst hot pot i've tried ever! the foods are expensive  quality is low  even the portion is so small  we ordered water melon juice  i could tell the water melon is not fresh at all  and it had been made for a while before i ordering it  i did not drink it after first try  for the soup base only  they chargers is $29(3ppl)  what a rob! i will never ever come back again nor recommend to my friend  i will suggest them to save money n stay away 
this place is horrible  the management is completely a mass  the food is just like any other hot pot place in flushing  i thought i would be impress by the watermelon hotpot  but it taste so plain like water  my hubby and i were waiting for the meat  after sitting for 1 hour finish eating all the vegetable on the table  meat is still not here!! we asked the waiter  he said he will bring it up  after another 30mins  i was completely pissed  i was hungry and tired after work  i just want a nice dinner to treat myself  so i asked politely if i can speak with the manager  the manager do not want to speak to me  fine  i asked for the check  and meat still not here  i will give one star for just the innovation of the hotpot  food? lmao  don't even bother  little lamb is a lot better  btw  just the vegetable  without meat no seafood  they charge us $80   this is crazy!!! how much can two people can possibly eat for $80 of vegetable?!!!!
good food  better than other chinese buffet hotspot place  recommend to go if you want better dinning experience 
have to order the fresh chicken and put them in first so that you would have a great pot of chicken and winter melon soup! so good
if you decide to eat here  waiter and waitress do not know what they are doing  be prepare to be waiting for a long time 
good atmosphere  fresh food   a bit pricey than average hotpot  but worth it 
2 stars   "meh  i've experienced better " not the best hot pot place which is unfortunate because i think it's a cute place  it's pretty small  waiting took a long time but they have a little waiting area with seats and they give you cups of tea (which was nice of them i guess)  i think it's so unique that they have watermelon soups and winter melon? soups  it's literally hotpotting in a melon which is cute but it's so pricey  i got the winter melon which was $20 + $3 per person so yes the soup itself was $32  i would much rather order more meat with that money  other than them giving tea while waiting  i didn't like their service  it takes them so long to refill tea  and they didn't give us the stand for the ladles  this was disappointing because every other table had one  we had to ask for ladles  like come on  that should be the first thing you give  also  they didn't give us the stands  so the ladles were touching the raw meats  to end this review  i'd also like to add that they only have 2 sauce options  they just put it on your table  not a fan of the sauces either  needless to say  i won't be coming back 
this szechuan restaurant opened not too long ago  i have always been a big fan of szechuan food and how they spice up there foods  i tried coming here before around 7 00 pm before but it was a full house  however  today i came at 8 00 pm and there was just enough space  overall the food was pretty food  not too spicy with ton of flavors!!
nice food  nice service ) i ordered chinese sausage casserole and it is pretty good! also the spicy rib noodle is very good too  and not too saulty  this is just something i'm looking for in flushing )next time i will like to try the broiled fish! will keep updating reviews!
bon g  and i found this new sichuan restaurant on yelp and having tried most of the others in flushing chose this one on saturday evening  arrived circa 9 15 pm and the place was only moderately occupied so we were seated immediately  finding this place was sort of difficult as none of the signs on the block were in english   we had to use the specific address to locate the correct venue  once inside we were welcomed and given menus  they have an extensive selection of dishes and we started with a really nice rendition of sliced beef and ox tongue in chili sauce in a red hot oil which gave it a nice smokey taste  also got sichuan cold noodles   sort of like dan dan noodles   you mix up the bowl and the heat mixes thru the noodles and gives the dish an incredible taste and burn    of course i added red hot oil to everything like people add salt without tasting the dish!   we tried a new dish for us  chinese bacon & sausage casserole which was light on the meat but the crispy rice was the bomb   the waiter scraped out all the rice from the cast iron pot and it was incredible just by itself   mala mapo tofu was next and it also was beautifully prepared and presented  it had minced pork which added alot to the flavor and consistency      i can see how this place fills up quickly due to its size  we were lucky and found a parking spot directly across the street   a good omen! with so many new entrants in flushing i'm sure we will return but we are always on a quest to find new and exciting dining venues in the area!
very yummy clay pot rice   the crisp of rice at the bottom of clay pot was so  delicious making me eat unstoppable   we love the dice chicken with chilli peppers as well   taste was  good everything just nice in size and price is reasonable too t
i give two stars because the food is so salty and the desserts like a water  today i ordered three dishes and two of it is so salty  after dinner  i ordered two desserts to take out   durian aloe sogo sweet soup and mango poweto sago sweet soup  both taste so bad like a water   i can't found any durian and mango inside and one of durian sweet soup after taste is sour  today is my first and last time to this place   i don't know how good they are  
great food and service! i have say i had the best cantonese and sichuan food here! both  by the way you must try their dessert  better than lady m 
this place is literally my restaurant to go to all the time now  it's close to my home  good flavor and friendly stuff  the portion is just okay compares to the price though  but still  come and try this place everyone!!
this is our favorite new style si chuan spicy dishes in town  they use very fresh ingredients and staff are super friendly  different varieties of unique soup in their menu to choose from  they also offer cantonese style small pot rice (rice crispy can be made to order too)  their desserts are delicious also and price are very reasonable  they also offer seasonal items such as moon cake lately are in different flavors too  my family like this little and warm eatery we all gave them two thumbs up!
excellent sichuan food  very authentic and reasonably priced  we had the spicy fish  pretty spicy and numbing like it should be  the spicy clear noodles were also pretty tasty  service was also excellent and attentive  the bonus was they were letting us sample some freshly made moon cakes which were very delicious  apparently they made extra  so we ended up ordering two boxes of moon cakes 
a new restaurant  authentic and flavorful  must go place  the owner is soooooooo much nice  treat kind  the specialty is the new style 水煮鱼，best one i have ever had in flushing area，trust me worth to go
this is one of my favor restaurants in flushing  convenient location  heathy cooking and amazing taste! you will find home taste here 
the best authentic sichuan restaurant in flushing  spicy crab & 水煮鱼 are must try if you like spicy food  煲仔饭 is also very good  have been coming here once a week  highly recommended!
if you're looking to satisfy your craving for kebabs  but also feel like being a cheapo  this is the place for you!for about 10 bucks (or less!)  you can get a super hearty meal with any protein of your choice  or you can even mix it up  i got the lamb kebab and beef kofta platter ($10)  which comes with a total of 2 skewers of meat  a lot of brown rice  and a salad on the side  the lamb was super tender and delicious  and the beef was just as delicious! the food was certainly plentiful and left me more than satisfied  definitely got the most bang for my buck!the place is far from fancy  and is more like an afghan fast food joint where they have a variety of options besides kebabs such as cheeseburgers  wings  fries  etc  there's also a small parking lot right in front of the restaurant (enough for 5 6 cars) cash only!
amazing authentic food  great service  has a very homey family feel to it  definitely recommend and will definitely be coming back  with friends 
i rarely write reviews  but i had to for the horrible service i received here  i mad an order over the phone and the total was supposed to be $42 but the guy said our total is $54  we asked him to explain and he just yelled and shouted over the phone and hung up on us twice  i then went recently  and the guy overcharge us by 2 dollars   even after tax was included  the food is great but i would rather go to bakhtar where the service and food is better 
this place is a nice place to try out if you are craving some really delish bbq pizza! the workers are great and the food is always prepared fast and fresh  their bbq wings are also a great option if you are by  this is definitely a small place with not the strongest aesthetic but the food really is satisfying!
top 3 afghan places in queens as far as quality of food goes! and they have halal pizza!!! a must try!only downfall is there service is horrible! they don't believe in any customer service whatsoever
best afghan food in queens hands down  rice is very flavorful  chicken is juicy  and the lamb is so so tender it's unreal! try their keema pizza it has minced meat and the slice is huge  their buffalo chicken pizza is also great  basically nothing bad to say here 
no frills restaurant  �rice was soft  beef and lamb kofta was cooked and spiced just right  �staff was very nice and accommodating  �would definitely return and recommend to anyone in the mood for afghan food  �most of their menu options are ~$9 99  worth it 
extremely unprofessional  i placed phone order and confirmed a 10 minute pickup  i arrived on time and the place was locked as the guys decided to pray  i waited 15 minutes outside and when the place re opened i found out that the guy didn't even write down my order which was simply#9  never heard of such childish unprofessionalism 
they are specificall for burgers  i would tell excellent food but service 60 % they should need more quickly �service  mahbub hossain
good service and kabobs  for the price  it's definitely worth a try  i believe this was under 10$!!
don't place an order online or for takeout  they will rip you off  the owner is a thief  he gave me the order i placed on yelp without telling me he left things out  later  when i returned to the restaurant to let him know  he blamed the website's pricing was off then tried to shake me down for cash if i wanted the rest of my order that i had already paid for online there are many better alternatives like bakhter kababs in fresh meadows that are honest and taste better than this trash establishment 
amazing kababs  their beef tikkas are delicious  try their samosas also  those tasted great  a hidden �gem  �definitely recomended 
the kababs are really good there  friendly staffs  prices are reasonable and portions are good 
aria kabab is a staple in kew gardens hills  it's location is perfect because it's right underneath the neighborhood mosque! everything is halal and just delicious  they have afghan cuisine  your typical rice and kababs with meats according to your preference  they also serve some amazing sandwiches  burgers and a super delicious pizza  it is an extremely clean restaurant and they have added a customer restroom inside the restaurant as well  there are plenty of tables to sit but it's more of a casual sit in so if you're not looking to just hang out and eat  take out may be the way to go  either way  it's a gem in the neighborhood and the staff is really very kind  having halal food so close to home is always a blessing 
great food  i love the chicken and lamb  there chicken shawarma is really good as well  the afghani bread is so delicous and they make the meat fresh  i love their food  have been eating here since 2012  i highly recommend their food muhammed
food is always great the only problem is the timing  the food takes forever to come out so try ordering before hand on the phone don't forget to try their �buffalo chicken pizza
i had another chicken tikka craving today so we ordered from aria  used grubhub against yelpers recommendation not to and everything worked out just fine  i think they probably worked out all the issues since that review  its still yummy as ever and my son tried their chicken shawarma wrap this time  i dont know if this thing qualifies as a wrap  they need to invent a new word to describe this monsterously gigantic creation  my son can eat and eat and eat and he could not finish this wrap  that's a first! well worth ordering if you are especially hungry and even good to eat on the go  it was assembled well and did not fall apart despite its size 
we mostly order take outs from this place  the food is fresh and service is friendly  chicken tikka over rice is the best they take orders on the phone so call ahead to save time!
not that special  food tastes average  the chicken was the only good thing  bakhtar is still the best hands down!!
omfg  okay so the place is nothing fancy  but the food is so good  5 stars for the food  3 for the interior  it was nice and clean though which was a plus  try the chicken cheese philly sandwich thang and the rice with chicken kabab (#7 i believe ) the zesty fries were a good appetizer too  everything for about 20 bucks and more than enough for 2 people lol 
i live near by and came to this place not worrying about the staff being friendly  even was expecting rude  all the reviews said it was good food bit bad service  i was looking for good food i went inside and asked for the chicken tikka and was immediatly greeted very warmly by a hispanic gentleman  the gentleman behind the counter said it would be about 7 minutes for my order  i overheard him tell someone else it was his 2nd day working their  when my food came out he even asked me how many white sauces and hot sauces i needed(my order was to go)  the food  absolutely delicious  might even be a 5 5  but im stingy on giving out fives i found a new spot 
ive had aria's food a number of times   it's always been delicious! their platter food is good but their specialty pizza is where its at in my opinion  they have good wings as well 
found this place on yelp at first i was skeptical about ordering and i was more than happy i did   it was the best chicken and rice i ever had!! i definitely recommend this place  �i ordered tikka kababs over rice and salad i also ordered a side of hummus   everything was made fresh!!! definitely try the white sauce it comes with and the green chutney sauce it's all amazing   the guy behind the counter was friendly and the store itself is very clean!!!
4 stars because the food is consistently good but the service is a work in progress  they're always so overwhelmed with catering orders that in store service can take a loooong time  but everything i've had there is good   pizza  kebabs  burgers  worth the wait 
aria kabob is the worst  i called to place a catering order and the guy over the phone hung up on me and had a very nasty attitude  all the prices that are listed on their menu online are less than the prices they quote when you call them  complete rip off and horrible service  save yourself the headache and go to bakhtar instead 
phenomenal food  i usually get the chicken kufta and tikka and it is very good  everything is cooked well as well as the rice  staff is friendly and it takes less than ten minutes to get the order  the price for the food is less than $10 which is very convenient since they give a sizebale portion of rice  chciken  white sauce  and salad  best halal food in this area!
i really really like this place  it has a lot going for it and is much better than its predecessor mirage  it's just down the road from queens college and near plenty of street parking  the entire menu is top notch and fairly priced  the pizza is very good and always fresh  the homemade burger is spiced to perfection and is melt in your mouth tender  all the kabobs are delicious too  especially the kofta kabob  the fish sandwich and lamb over rice are also very good  �they also have the best green sauce i have ever had  furthermore  they have a huge drink (non alcoholic) selection including a frozen drink machine  try the strawberry it's outstanding  the owner and his son are both awesome guys  they are so friendly and always a pleasure to talk with while i wait for my delicious take out  they are both former tennis players  and as a huge fan myself  i always enjoy talking with them about that! all in all this place is probably the best restaurant in the neighborhood 
4 15 upping it up to 5 stars again  food has been on point  11 1 14 update  i had to change my review from 5 stars to 3  it seems like they are under new management  if that is true  that explains it  yesterday  our order of cheeseburgers did not have cheese  my chicken hero was not on a hero  but on a burger bun  also  i ended up throwing the entire "sandwich" out because the chicken wasn't cooked  disgusting and a waste of money  because of my prior positive experiences  i may have to give them another chance  i just need time to recover                                                     aria kabab has become our new favorite takeout place  originally we would always pick up food from bakthar but then decided to try aria one day  best decision ever made  this place has been our ramadan staple  we kept a menu and we always call in our orders in advance and then usually pick them up if we are out and about  they do deliver  so when we inquired about having food delivered to our house (we live about 30 blocks away) they were more than happy to  and did  we just needed to give them some extra time  which was completely fine  some things that we have gotten that we love   8 ounce cheeseburger  grilled chicken sandwich hero  rice and kabob platters  buffalo chicken pizza  philly cheesesteak  chicken parmoverall  a great place to takeout  they are fast and food is delicious!
yea  l'd like to be clear that the food was really really delicious but the service was really bad  the guy was rude to me and my friends which really ruined the whole experience for me  he was annoyed that i wanted a container to go to bring my leftovers home   
rude people with nasty attitude    only nice if they are not busy or u can speak their language      if u order on line they will reduced your food quantity or weight food taste is good but no business sense 
not a terrible place to go for food because it is flavorful and filling  everything was well made and timely  not the best place to go because the meats are a little over cooked  not the cleanest place to go and eat  the staff seem a little unwelcoming  and but they do try to make the experience a little better  they definitely have a large variety of food to choose from  and it is actually better than most places of afghan cuisine 
aways take out from this place and call in order before arriving because it takes some time to make  food is always fresh and tastes amazing  favorite is the chicken tikkah over rice  the lamb is also really good
this place had great food  i always �get the chicken �burger  the samosas hummus the fresh bread kabab's everything �is good the only thing is they don't �always �get the order right  i'm �not sure why but something is always �wrong with the order but my family �loves the food so we don't �mind it we still eat it 
food was good and they had a variety of fast food but also had grown up food too  �they stayed open longer which was great because the guests only eat halal and had small children
tried chapli kebab and spaghetti with meat ball   chapli kebab was nice but spaghetti lol i won't call it spaghetti that was more like risotto   they don't have the real spaghetti so if you want to try risotto then try it else waste of bucks   cheers
their food is on point  but the people who work there are bunch of ignorant  uncivilized  primitive people  they are nice to some people they know  but for the rest of us they will behave as if they are doing us a favor  and we are wasting their time people go out to eat for the taste  yes  but for the service as well  and the owner of this restaurant fails to understand that basic concept the restaurant is listed on the grubhub  but you will get yelled at if you ever make the mistake of ordering through grubhub  they have different prices on different websites  and the price you actually pay at the store is always the most expensive one bottom line  a good place to enjoy good food as long as you don't mind being treated like an inmate  but for me  i will be on the hunt for an alternative 
friendly staff(sometimes lol) i like their pizza and chicken over rice! thats all i buy there  i really like when i call for a pickup  they will tell you the exact time to pick it up!!! keep it up guys!!!
called on the phone to make an order for delivery because their menu said "we deliver" and the guy started yelling at me in the most nastiest way saying "no delivery  guy not here!!!!" and then hung up  horrible horrible horrible service  avoid at all costs  you're better off going to mcdonald's down the street 
i usually go and eat inside  one of my favorite places in the area  the food is always well prepared  fresh  and delicious  the staff is friendly and the prices are great  so i fully recommend the place 
ordered twice from there with a total of about $90 in various food samplings  �i can attest that the food is tasty and the portions are decent 
this place is amazing  the food takes a little long to prepare but everything on the menu tastes amazing  you can get a discount if you order in bulk  highly recommend this place over bakhtar 
fat peter rating system  as follows  stars  standard yelpchance i will be back  yeswhy i went �  friends lives near herehad homemade hummus with homemade afghan bread  �so good i almost joined their religion and joined the cause  �start a jihad (very good)chicken wrap was good  not phemoincal but good enough i be back good experience 
i have eaten here couple of times and to be fair it's not a four star restaurant  max would be three star 
very good afghani food  the service was friendly and price was just right  we ordered the chicken and lamb tikka and the chicken and beef kafta  both were excellent!
i use to love this place their food is just great! however their customer service skills are horrible  i use to eat food here almost every day  i had even told my wife to give them a good tip  and they still treat u like bad 
stayed near by and decided to check it out  got the chicken shawarma wrap for $5 99   it was excellent  the person at the counter was cool and the place was clean  will be back next time i'm in town 
i remember back in the day when i had free time on my hands  i would drive out to aria all the way from long island to satisfy my craving for afghan food  friendly service and quick too
the staff is friendly  attentive  and helpful  the menu is quite extensive  with a wide variety of choices  everything i've tried from pizza to chicken over rice has been good  their hot sauce is delicious   green but nonetheless amazing! i will be back to try more dishes!
simple place that you wouldn't really go looking for    but you should  excellent kofta kabob  deliciously seasoned with a hint of heat too  really good food  service was super friendly and willing to talk to you about the foods and what to get  definitely a place to try if you're in the area 
i work in the neighborhood and this is by far our favorite spot to go to  don't let the meager decor fool you   this place makes some seriously good food  their kebabs are first rate  cooked fresh to order  and are consistently excellent  my favorite is the combo that comes with both chicken tikka and chicken kafta  �any kebab you get  be sure to add on the carrots and raisins  i love that stuff so much that it's gotten to a point where i get double orders of it on my kebab  �the authentic afghan bread that comes with the kebabs is also excellent  �don't forget to ask for both the green and white sauces  both of which go wonderfully with the kebabs  go here and you will not be disappointed  �the service is always super friendly and welcoming  which makes it a great experience every time we go 
just like it says when you choose how many stars you want to give "meh  i've experienced better" from a local stand point i would not go here again rather go to bakhtar halal kabob   based on my experience the good was raw the white sauce was watery and the rice was hard   second experience went for the pizza horrible tasted old   i would give it 1 star but i did not because the place looked nice ad clean   and the guy at the register was nice although i could not understand him
recently i tried the kabuli palow and chicken tikka and lamb it's amazing the pizza is amazing the sauce is just unique they just added two machines extra for other varieties of food since this store has been opened for just a while they improved dramatically i an very picky but this is by far the best the seasonin and quality is good and those customer service is good
the only thing i like about this place is the homemade burger  it's delicious just the right flavor  �but for the kebab i still give my vote to bakhter the one across the street from bombay theater
i've tried the following dishes in the past at aria and i enjoyed them all thoroughly    regular burger   spicy buffalo pizza  kabab with qabili pallow  garlic bread rolls  kashmiri green tea with cardamonthe kashmiri chai is a very softened version of the indian pakistani chai because it's made with green tea  it's very soothing and doesn't have a lot of caffeine  �the burger was really nice  and rather huge  they add some subtle spices to it but it's not too much so you can feel the nice flavor of a burger  it's really big though  �the pizza has a nice dough  light  and the ingredients seem to be of good quality  the spicy buffalo wings in it were very flavorful  �the kabab and qabili pallow was good  i'd save a bit above average but has a nice authentic afghani taste to it the place is clean and the owner is very friendly  i highly recommend this place ps  as of this review they take only cash at the store and they said they're working on their credit card system 
zero stars  called for an order for pickup  was quoted 15 minutes  �showed up 25 minutes later  reconfirmed my order  asked them where my order was 45 minutes after ordering  they had not started it  don't waste your time  do not give this place your business!
this is more a takeout than eat in place  but it's really clean and the kebabs are insanely good  �to make things even  better  they deliver! �i got beef tikka kebabs  rice  bread  and salad for 7 50  �they have a pretty extensive kebab menu and they also sell pizza and shawarma  �i've only had the kebabs because they are so good  i don't want to order anything else  
have had a thing for afghani food ever since i had some at a friend's place  decided to try out this place  we went with take out  although they do have seating available  the place was nice and tidy  the guy at the counter was very friendly  we ordered a combo platter (for 6 adults) and chapli kabab  so that we could try out the variety  the kababs and rice were out of the world  both lamb and chicken kababs  the guy even offered a free cup of soup  which was also good  the food quantity was great  everyone was well fed and there was still food left  will definitely be going there again  or maybe we'll see if they can deliver to our place which would be great
