No photos cuz we had a jet lagged toddler lying on my husband through dinner ha, but this was one of my favorite meals during our trip to see family in the area. My mother in law is a pro at ordering and we enjoyed 2 veggie dishes, a mixed one w snap peas and Chinese yam, and of course an eggplant dish (my go to). They have a roast chicken with the ginger scallion sauce that every table seemed t have ordered and it was very flavorful. My favorite dish was the lobster sticky rice! It comes out it one of those huge flat steam baskets and filled with succulent lobster pieces. The body pieces were sweet and tender. Claws weren't great, but that's to be expected. Pre-cut so it was easy for me to make bites of food for my husband who was holding our toddler (no, we didn't bring a stroller on our trip womp womp). Oh we also got a egg and shrimp dish for Miss A, she ate it later sleepyhead. Service was prompt and professional, i liked the food a lot...much nicer than the HK cafes by our place in LA!
Just order a pickup from the place, salty fish with bean curd and diced chicken pot. It was okay, not great, but good for the price. As I almost finish the whole thing, I found a hair! Yes, HAIR!!!!! I know it cannot be mine because it was buried under all the bean curd!!!! 刚刚去买了外卖带回家吃到后面下面居然有一根头发 看的我直接去厕所 吐了出来 太恶心了
The Weekday lunch special is worth coming here, you get 3 dishes, soup, and 2 bowls of rice for $22 but it's on a separate menu that you have to ask for. The HK milk tea is a little on the pricey side almost $4 for iced. The 3 dishes were on the smaller side, I guess for the lunch special pricing. We got the Peking style pork chop (was done very well), Mapo Tofu (the tofu itself was good but the mapo sauce was a little lacking), and the Chinese broccoli with beef (wished it was a bigger portion) for 3 people. Although the portions were small it was enough to fill the 3 of us for brunch. Their regular menu is pretty extensive too. I would come back for their lunch specials.
Their lunch special is a pretty good deal. Choose 3 dishes for $21.99. Comes with two bowls of rice and soup for  everyone. Their phone line is currently down so cash only and you must call their 718.358.6588 number to place orders.
*link your CC to your yelp profile to get 5% cash back when dining here*It's a pretty spacious café, with plenty of seating on the inside. Minimal parking in their front lot (probably can fit 5 cars max). The food here comes out fast, but there is nothing very memorable about the place. I had the beef noodle soup ($6.95) and they ran out of the thick white noodles and had to substitute with the thin yellow egg noodles. Also, the beef chunks in the noodle soup were not very beefy, they were mostly beef tendons which I am not a fan of, so the stock photo in the menu is deceiving! Prices are in line for what you expect at a sit down restaurant, but I think I rather walk a few blocks up to the food court and have delicious beef noodle soup, with beef pieces for $5 instead.
Huge fan of HK cafes and Flushing really needed one!I ordered the Short Rib lunch special for $8 which comes with salad and soup, with an option of french fries or rice. I also ordered pan fried pork buns (4) for $3.25.My friend ordered Stir Fried Soy Sauce Noodle for about $8.The place is clean which is rare in Flushing 5/5.Food came pretty quick and was still very hot, I love eating my food extremely hot!We both enjoyed our dishes, there were 6-7 ribs which I think is a decent amount for the price. My friends Stir Fried Noodle was huge, it was enough to be shared with 2 and we still didn't finish it.The food taste authentic, like it does at any other Hong Kong cafe, comparable to Cha chan tang, but a little too oily -1 star.Would come back to try more of the menu!
I came here with a friend for dinner. The place was packed at night. We got one and one thing only(each of us got the same thing actually): oxtail with rice. Oxtail with rice: -Comes with raw dressed salad, soup, and then the dish itself. -Salad was unnecessary imo. Like come on, this is an Asian restaurant. *roll eyes*-soup was very flavorful... tastes like it came from a can tho -oxtail meat was sort of tough, but bearable-sauce had same base as the soup-the rice portion is equivalent to 1 bowl of rice Parking:-right in front of the restaurant enough to fit 4-5 cars -park as long as you want; tip is necessary Other notes:-I looked at other diners' tables and their food looked pretty appetizing. Or maybe just pretty. :p
Totally agree with Betty L that the food here is very bland and in addition to that, VERY OILY TOO! The husband and I shared a beef Chow fun and Shanghai noodle with our daughter. The food was so bad that I had didn't wanna continue eating. The noodles were so oily that I had to use a napkin to wipe off the oil before feeding my daughter. Ugh! It was a lot of work just for lunch too! We also shared a siu Mai thinking that they can't mess this dimsum up but we were wrong. The siu Mai tasted rather strange and horrible per the husband. It didn't have any seasoning with one piece of shrimp in the bottom and you can only taste the meat. It was definitely NOT a typical dim sum siu Mai #facepalmWhat we can't believe is how badly they messed up on a Hong Kong classic dish, BEEF CHOW FUN, when the name of this restaurant is HK Cafe! #sighduck Won't be returning even if they have the special lunch and dinner deals which we opted out of. Super MEH!
Today is Chinese Lunar Year Last Day Of Rooster，every one is happy to celebrate with family or friend.We have great time to eat here.
Big place for Hong Kong style bakery food, it open till 12:00. Good price for the food and spacious.
Stopped here for lunch today. My uncle says this place changes out a lot. It was a sushi place, then American food place and now back to Hong Kong food. Eh. The service is bleh. All they did was bring out drinks and food. Well they forgot about drinks until we reminded them once they brought out food. But that's all they did. They didn't come back to ask or check if we needed anything. The food..... so so so bland. Either too bland or too much sauce. One of our dish was super sauce and then the other three were super bland. No taste to it whatsoever. Don't think we will be returning here.
This place serves HK style dishes, Cantonese food. Congee, noodle soup, roast meats, and even western inspired dishes. They have this great lunch menu, which comes sith choice of rice or pasta, soup and salad. I strongly recommend the pasta. It was so good, I actually ordered one to go for lunch at work the next day. The portion lasted me two meals though. Of all the options, the short ribs is the best. I wouldn't recommend the curry chicken. The oxtail was ok, but want tender enough. On the western style menu they have these rice baked dishes, and oh dear, it's huge. Larger than I anticipated and it was really good. I ordered the baked porkchop over rice. It's baked with onions, tomatoes and cheese. It was delicious. Def get your money's worth.  They only accept cash
I think the quality and service has definitely gone down since the last time I came here, which was only 2 months ago. Staff were not friendly nor attentive like they used to be. My favorite dish from here that I always order, the curry chicken on rice was hard and dry. They used (bad?) boned-in chicken parts for the dish and it had a weird taste to it, which was not very appetizing. On top of that, they no longer have my favorite, borscht soup that is included with the lunch special but instead, it's canned clam chowder (yes, canned) and ranch dressing instead of thousand island :( They now take credit cards (used to be cash only) and their parking lot is no longer free (there's a mandatory $2 tip for valet). Very disappointed, will not be returning again.
As my mom and I walking along Main St., she decided to try this spot. I didn't want to eat too much so my mom ordered Pan Fried Buns and Beef Chow Fun (Dry). The buns are so small and the pork filling is shaped like a quarter shape. The color of the chow fun was light for my liking. Overall mediocre food. There are other better spots in Flushing.
I've driven past this location of few times but was never really in the area because it is quite a distance from the Main Street 7-Train station. They have a few spots outside for valet parking and will charge you $2. So you are better off just looking for street parking.I've been looking for a good HK food spot and was hoping this was it. This spot used to be a vegetarian restaurant many years back, but then it closed and a bunch of different restaurants kept opening but didn't do too well. So on a hot summer day while I was craving HK style food, I decided to finally visit this place.Since it was my first time here, I decided to ask the waitress for recommendations. However, I felt like she was trying way too hard to sell the expensive items on the menu like lobster, seafood, a whole chicken, etc. Even going as far as saying "if it's too much food, you can always pack it home." I came here for a small and simple HK style dish, not a giant meal that requires me lugging around the leftovers in the hot sun for the remainder of the day (this was lunch by the way).In the end I went with the wonton noodle soup and thought it was mediocre. Their coffee/milk tea mix, on the other hand, was actually pretty good.
This place has a good variety of hk style food.  The cuisine is authentic and price is good.
This is my go-to spot in Flushing for a quick meal! I love the roast duck or wontons with egg noodles and my bf loves the pepper steak with rice. It's a spacious restaurant and the food comes out super fast. I'm from Hong Kong and I do wish that they had more HK style noodle options, HK breakfast or street food. Don't think it's a truly authentic HK restaurant but it's a good spot for Chinese food.
Large portions, good pricing, tasty! I've found my new regular food spot for late night suppers. The place opens til midnight, and has a vast variety of options of the menu to choose from, which also includes lunch special!
3 stars.This place is a bit upscale by HK cafe standards and menu offerings a bit more limited than they "standard" HK cafe. But it's cleaner FWIW.Quality wise overall kinda average. Date friendly so to speak but parking tough.
New place in town! The place looks new and spacious. The decor looks great and the arrangement looks great. The food was good. I ordered Mapo Tofu over rice. The Mapo Tofu was well prepared, good balance between the spiciness and the ingredients flavor. I will come back to this place more often!
Coming from Texas, I've always been happy knowing that moving to New York meant better Chinese food, specifically Cantonese food. My experience at HK Cafe made me second guess that affirmation a bit. I went in with my boyfriend at 2pm in the middle of the weekday and there were 4 waiters and only 4 tables. I was happy since I was starving and thought, great, the service will be quick and I can get the food quickly!First off, the service was so slow throughout the meal. Our waters were constantly empty, the waiters kept forgetting to bring us either napkins, or the extra plate we asked for, etc. As a former waitress, I understand that things get a bit crazy and you might forget something and that's totally fine... but it was not busy, all the waiters were just strolling around the restaurant looking outside the windows. Food wise, I got the baked pork chop over rice, and the rice they used was definitely not Jasmine rice, and it gave a weird taste. The milk tea was only super expensive, and the whole lunch ended up being more expensive than I anticipated, especially since we were in Flushing and could have easily gotten something cheaper and quicker.
ATTENTION ALL YELPERS who loved Lok Lok...THEY ARE BACK to making Cantonese food and HK Style Cafe food. YAAAAY! 5 Stars just for the conversion back to their delicious Cantonese food but this time it's even better. Not only is there Cantonese dishes, they added HK style cafe food. YAY. I for one love it! There is so much to try that we decided to start with their lunch menu because this way the two of us can sample more. The lunch special menu is from 11 am to 4 pm for $8.99, after 4pm you can still order it for $3 more. We decided to order the Grilled Short Ribs, Stewed Oxtail Russian Style and Curry Chicken. The two of us knew it will be a lot of food but it's a good way to try a few dishes. The lunch dishes come with a bowl of delicious HK Style Borscht Soup, a small salad with french dressing and your choice of side: pasta, french fries or white rice. We had the white rice with Curry Chicken and the other two dishes we opted for Spaghetti minus the cheese since we're lactose intolerant. We also ordered the Rice Roll with Mixed Sauce from the Dim Sum menu. The highlight were the three lunch dishes we ordered. First of all I was soooooo happy to see the HK style Borscht Soup. It's my favorite soup of all time. Reminds me of my mom. My mom and I made it one day when I was younger. It is so delicious. It's tomato based and has nothing to do with Russian Borscht soup. There is ZERO beets in the HK style Borscht soup. It is a tomato based soup cooked with beef, celery, onion, carrot. At HK cafe, it was on point. DELICIOUS. The salad is whatever. It's a little roughage. I loved the Stewed Oxtail Russian Style. The taste profile is very similar to the Borscht which is fine because I love it. It is tomato based with potatoes, carrots, and deliciousness. The spaghetti with tomato sauce was also flavorful. For $8.99, this was a really good meal. The Chicken Curry with white rice was also very very yummy. It's made with dark meat only, AWESOME. White meat is dry anyways and bland so who needs it! There were some potatoes in it and I just removed the chicken skin before I ate it. DELICIOUS. It was very tasty and it was a little different than the normal Chinese Curry flavor. The flavor was actually different and I enjoyed it very very much. It surprised me, in a good way. Then the last dish to come out, the pièce de résistance was the grilled short rib. When it first came out the other waiter put cheese all over the pasta. The original waitress took it away because she knew I can't have dairy. That was really nice of her and we tipped her extra just because she understood it was very bad if I had it. I have very bad lactose intolerance, I will get really sick if I have dairy. The short ribs were soooo delicious. OMG. I bit into thinking the worse but I was sooooo proven wrong. It was soft and soooo flavorful. OMG. I could not eat more at the time because I was so full. I took everything home and I can't wait to have it again.The old Lok Lok used to have a family combo special where you pick 3 entrees and it comes with soup and 2 bowls of rice for $21.95. I hope they bring that type of deal back so I can try a larger variety of dishes. I want to come back and try other dishes so bad. Thanks to Michael L for letting me know that the steak and sushi place is now HK Cafe, I believe it's the same owner and cook. I can't wait to go back again and again. Welcome back Lok Lok, ooops, I meant HK Cafe! I am soooo happy that it is Cantonese and HK style cafe food now that I will go back again and again. Yay. Hopefully there will not be anymore drastic changes again. YAY.They serve Cantonese "BBQ/Roasted" meats, i.e. roasted duck, roast pork, roasted crispy skinned pig, etc., but at HK Cafe it is not displaying in the window. HK Cafe is not a place to come buy the "BBQ" meats by the pound. ** CASH ONLY****Fried Chicken Wings, WOAH! You gotta try it! It's delicious!**
So Lok Lok is back as HK Cafe..... after some missed calculation of Steak & Sushi place which lasted only several months.I like the lunch special with five difference choices and comes with soup and salad. We actually tried 4 out of 5. Each one is good especially the oxtail and curry chicken. Rated 5/5.Their wide noodle with beef is lot less attractive and lack in flavor'\; need improvement. Rated 3/5the Shanghai noodle was not that good either. Lack flavor, lack ingredients and too much on the onions. Rated 3/5Waiters are sometime great and sometimes just not available; mostly because there is enough to coverage all the tables when it is busy at lunch time.Lunch specials are available on weekends too.Parking in front of restaurant is $2.
Came here after my dress fitting at Paris for a quick lunch with my bridesmaids. It had convenient parking if you can't find parking for valet it's 2 dollar tip. I ordered beef chow fun it was a really large portion. I came here before but never got a chance to review. Every experience I've had here was good. Food was decent and comparable to typical Chinese dim sum spots but they get an additional star for service.
I went over there with my family for lunch today. I was really surprise that the food are really good. Everyone in my family did enjoy all the food that we had order. The menu has a lot of choice and different style of western food too. The restaurant is clean, price is reasonable and the service is average. I have to asked the waiter come over to change our plate. The only thing bother me a little is that the restaurant has free valet parking in front of the location, and there is a sign states you must give the parking attendant $2 Tips! $2 isn't too much money. But, you don't demanding tips!!!!!
Very standard HK style food, reasonable price and easy parking. I especially liked the salt & pepper squid, and shrimp wonton soup. This place wouldn't disappoint yet wouldn't wow you. Nothing to rave about and nothing to complain about. Perfect place for a quick meal without insulting your palate.
This space used to be the Lok Lok Restaurant but they changed ownership and re-branded.  They continue to offer $2 valet parking out front.Mayo shrimp - 3 stars:  flavors as you'd expect but very small portion; bit of a rip offHot and spicy diced chicken - 1 star:  we didn't expect the chicken to be diced bone-in; extremely difficult to eat and barely any meatSalt and pepper pork chop - 4 stars:  nice crisp but over did it with the saltWide noodles with shrimp - 5 stars:  definitely the star of the meal; very sizable plate tooI was surprised we could not find any pure green vegetable dishes on the menu.  In any case, service was good and prompt.
Seems this place on Main Street is constantly changing names (it was called Lok Lok a few months ago). Hopefully it'll still be named HK Café by the time you go.  They serve Cantonese and Shanghai dishes. My family and I went there at busy prime dinner time (7pm on a Sunday). Place was packed and people were lined up with numbers for seating. Luckily, we were a large enough group so we were able to grab the last large table. We waited like five minutes.  :-)The wait staff was super quick to clean and setup and quite attentive even though it was super busy. The menu was easy to read through, nice pics and plenty of variety (category wise) so it was easy to find food for all. Even my picky 7 yr old (she ate the fries okay, just saying).For starters we ordered the soup dumplings (6 pcs), the scallion pancakes (picky girl liked it too, a win for me), and fried dumplings for the table. The soup dumplings were small to medium in size, it is not the quality like a real Shanghai place would churn out.  They tasted fine flavor wise but it was smaller than it should be.  Still juicy - there was soup in it. The fried dumplings were crisp and good texture.  Was not overly oily and my son devoured it so I would say it was worth it.  I tried one and liked the meat filling.  The scallion pancakes were very good, extra crispy and definitely saw the scallions.  Simple and as expected.The entrees:- lobster with ginger and scallion, was cooked right but not to the level of a larger "family style seafood restaurant" quality.  Totally enjoyable still and satisfies the craving.    - Shanghai Rice Noodles with Pork. Had a good amount of green veggies (mustard greens and shanghai bok choy) with slivers of pork.  Not too soft - hubby likes it chewy so this was a good texture.  - Sauteed Chives with Squid.  This was a nice change for a veggie dish. My family usually orders Spinach and peas so having the chives was refreshing. It is a simple dish, as it sounds.  The squid was great.- Spaghetti with meat sauce and fried egg, as I said something for all...this was my son's request (10 year olds, go figure).  He enjoyed it thoroughly, didn't even want to share. But I did manage to get to try the spaghetti and the tomato sauce was on the sweeter side (not a surprise in Chinese restaurants).  It was a good East meets Western dish.  - House Special Half Chicken (cage free), very tender, tasted really fresh, and don't be fooled by it's yellow skin color, tasted just as yummy as any soy based chicken.  You don't miss the sauce here.  It is indeed a signature dish.- Stewed Oxtail Combo Meal, this came with a large bowl of stewed oxtail (reddish brown gravy), and had lots of carrots.  This was the best deal (price wise) and very good for sharing.  It came with a house salad (individual portion) and a small soup.  This was my favorite.Side note:  Treat this place like a casual family style dining - almost like a HK style Canteena but with table service.  It's prices make it a keeper and for the casual and relaxed ambiance.  It does serve wine (we didn't order any) and they do sell bubble tea drinks.  I wish I ordered but forgot about it once I was eating as the plates just kept coming. I would go back for the price and convenience.  And it's far off from the hustle bustle of Main Street so I liked that I wasn't on top of people to get in and out.
Big promotion~3 dishes 1 soup 2 rice only $21.99! Chicken taste so good, i think which is the most delicious chicken in flushing area!
Came here for a family style meal. This place was like any other place - nothing spectacular. The worst was athe xiao long bao because the skin was too thin and it just broke. It tasted fine but the whole point of those is to eat it whole with soup. Disappointing. Nothing too salty and decent. But that's the whole verdict. However, the problem came with the service. We ordered plenty of dishes in which they repeated to us in verbatim. However there were STILL mistakes. We had several dishes that came out wrong but we accepted since it was already here. The other is the fact that the wait staff seems to be too slow to realize we ran out of tea and water. It took us until almost finishing before it was refilled. But what's worst was when my boyfriend dropped his tea on the floor. I know it's busy but if you hear the drop of the cup or if you see the customer cleaning, you should do something. However no one came to help - none. That was truly disappointing as my boyfriend cleaned their wet floors with the napkin they provided. And for those who worry about bathrooms, theirs is clean but the floor is a bit sticky.
Excited to try this place and came on a weekday to get takeout: 3.5 stars actually (food court in Elmhurst is better)I ordered the oxtail lunch special ($8.95) that came with either pasta, fried rice, and few other options. Also came with a delicious soup + salad (I didn't even get a dressing for it). Also got an order of the Shanghai fried noodle ($8.95) I believe it's called (thick noodles + meat + mushroom). Flavored really well except the meat was dry overcooked and under seasoned (felt like I was chewing on rubber).Try it for yourself and don't get what I ordered. Get something else that's popular or you'll be wasting your money. Not the best place for value of money but this place changed 3x since it opened soo I hope they do better with this cafe.
Decent place, quick service, and friendly staffs.... came here for breakfast with family plus visiting relative before she flys back to Asia(dont wanna say exact place lol). Portions are big especially the congees, I couldn't finish mine since we also ordered some dim sum too...
A decent Hong Kong Style spot in flushing that has more Chinese offerings than said Hong Kong authentic style dishes. The variety of the menu is worth the trip here and back. We like getting the roast duck over noodles. The broth is delicious, the duck is on the salty side but compliments the plain noodles (hor fun is better) really well! Would return to try other dishes and their iced milk tea.
After leaving the Presbyterian Hospital due to a dislocated shoulder from diving, we wanted to eat at the QQ Cafe. Instead, we came here. Before it was the Lok Lok restaurant.The restaurant wasn't that busy at the time. We ordered their wanton noodle soup. We thought that it took a long time for it to make. The wonton noodle soup was visually appealing. The noodles are chewy and the soup was clear.
Just finished dinner here. We ordered cage free chicken congee, wonton noodle soup and lamb with yuba. We like the congee and noodle soup most. The portion of lamb is generous and the taste is okay.The service is good and quick.
The food here is OK.  I was here on a Saturday morning and parking was horrendous around the area.  They have a small parking area outside the restaurant and it's packed- good luck finding parking. In terms of food, I wished there was more dim sum options. We got the steam rice noodles- which was alright. I kinda like the ones from canteen 88.  The soup dumplings was bad- don't get it.   The wonton noodle soup was good- wantons were fresh.  The chicken congee was a OK. Portion size was small and pricing is a little on the higher side. Interior is nice and looked a lot more modern than before.  Overall, it was an OK experience.
I used to come here a lot and I've seen the owner change this place a couple times already. But overall, they had pretty good service. The servers are very attentive and give us tissues even when we don't ask for it. The menu has a lot of choices now. In the morning it's mainly dimsum from 9am. Starting from 11am and on other dishes are offered as well. It's authentic Hong Kong Style food. My favorite was the pan-fried stuffed pork buns. Their portions are pretty reasonable for their prices as well. For later hours, they have great meal combos that customers can order from. Their drinks range more bubble tea, Japanese matcha to Thai iced tea. It's nice to have a lot of choices. They have parking right outside the restaurant which is always a plus, especially in Flushing.
We came here because it was close to the Queens Botanical Garden.  The place was packed for lunch and we had to wait a bit for a table to open up. We don't mind that at all since that means it's popular and the food is fresh.  They have a wide menu. I had the minced beef congee, it was good. I also ordered the Siu Mai (pork dumplings), that was surprisingly bland and bad. They didn't have worcestershire sauce which usually goes with Siu Mai.  We also ordered one of the lunch special dishes, oxtail stew (tomato sauce, with carrots, celery and potatoes), which came with vegetable soup (bland, not hot), salad and fries (hot and fresh).Overall a good experience and I'd go here again.
Not surprisingly from my first review, but this place is closed down due to health inspections
Come in for the very 1st time recommended by friends. The dishes here are well presented and doesn't disgrace me and my companions. The owner and servers are well service...one excellent dish that needed to recommend is the drunken chicken which melted to the mouth even for a non meat eater like me...
This is one of my favorite spots to hit up in flushing, mostly bc it's free parking out front... and it's not smack in the central congested part. The hours are great for breakfast until a quick late dinner (closes at midnight). This place really lives up to be a "Hong Kong cafe"- quite authentic.For food, I think this is the best wonton mee in the queens area! I take back what I said about Sifu Chow on prince st.... their noodles reminds me of the delicious ones from famous Hong Kong joints. The noodles are tangy and thin, the broth is wonderful... tastes extra delicious if you add some duck pieces as a topping. The wontons are smaller than at sifu chow but they're more wholesome- you see some shrimp chunks! I absolutely love it. Cage free chicken congee is not bad, has cilantro which is different. It's thick. Had their preserved egg & pork congee and it's not so good. They put sesame oil in their congee so it really alters the traditional congee taste IMO. Husband loves the tomato and egg with beef over rice. Fried pork buns are pretty good. Drinks are nice although a bit pricey. The shanghai noodles are awful. Since this place is new, it's clean. Well kept, nicely decorated where it's not embarrassing to bring someone you semi have to impress, and very polite waitstaff. A lottttttt of variety in the menu. Recommend for breakfast to lunch.
I just stopped by but it is closed due to violation of food and mental health since August 10, 2017. I found the food during lunch to be oily. The previous times I had dinner were good.
Best Hong Kong style cafe I've been to. The wanton soup with shrimp is to die for and the fried rice was amazing. You have to try the Chinese tea. It is great with sugar. The scallion pancakes were out of this world!!!!!
We ordered the Peking Duck on Christmas Eve, and even though the place was busy we were given great service. The waitresses and waiters were extremely nice, although a little frazzled from the amount of customers. They were also quick to give us extras of the toppings to the duck wraps which were delicious and flavorful.
Great new Hong Kong restaurant in Flushing! This place seems to keep changing, maybe this restaurant will stick around. Good Hong Kong and Cantonese food, also some Shanghai dishes. Modern decor and pretty spacious. Pretty good selection on the menu. The baked pork chop over spaghetti was good.
I was really happy that Lok Lok is reincarnated, but was super disappointed that the quality has gone way down. I'm still giving it 4 stars because I want them to get back to their old standards! In reality, I thought it was more like 2-3 stars. I miss the rice rolls with shrimp and cruellers back in the Lok Lok days. Please bring that back!!!!! Their dumplings are also not as good as they used to be. And their turnip cakes too.
4 entrees ordered:Free range chicken: tasty, but too much white meatShanghai thick noodle:  it was not really "thick" noodle, more of like "medium" noodle.House stir fry:  expertly done consisted squid, silver fish, chives and arrow roots Water spinach:  okayService was crispy and bath room was spotless.More if 3.5 stars since it lacked multiple signature dishes.
Delicious Food, Expedited serviceThis restaurant serves a variety of traditional Hong Kong style cafe food. -Their fried chicken wings were delicious! Large, juicy, and tender wings. -Shen Jian Bao (pan seared pork buns) has just the right amount of broth and were seared just right to have a crispy bottom yet fluffy top. Note, these buns also had the perfect amount of meat to bread ratio. We actually saw them making the buns in the back. Two chefs were making them in a very clean and organized counter top.-Baked pasta wasn't novel but the comfort food was made just sweet enough to remind me of the actual baked pasta that is served in Hong Kong. -Drinks I would say the boba ice tea was status quo, nothing too exciting but at least the boba balls were chewy and not stale. Ditto for the Thai ice tea and watermelon juice.Service wise I would say was great. This is a very busy restaurant so you could tell they rush to get you your food and then rush you out the door. No biggie tho, this is not the type of establishment to meander at. Parking is a toughie though. There's only about 16 spots total, you can leave your keys with someone at the restaurant if you have double parked but just know that public parking is limited.
I am so glad they decided to go back to Cantonese cuisine versus the steak and sushi operation they had before. Lunch time is BUSY AS HELL! Luckily, we were able to get a seat for 9 fairly quickly even though it was chaos. They offer the Hong Kong style milk teas and coffees. Plenty of food options! The chicken wings were surprisingly good. It had the perfect crunch and was well seasoned. I would definitely get it again. The cage free chicken congee was good and not too salty. The soy sauce noodles were the winner! The entire table really liked it and I liked that they added a variety of seafood and some vegetables so it's not too boring. The hor fun noodles with sauteed beef were standard. And of course, who can forget wonton soup - good but not as good as the original Lok Lok location. All great portions to share. Disappointed that they don't have dim sum options but they do have a plain rice noodle roll with peanut sauce dip if you're looking for something similar. Clean restaurant, good food, cozy enough. I would definitely come back to try more dishes!
The food quality is decent. They could have done a better job on dishes they brought out of the kitchen. Nothing looks any close to ones in the menu. By the way, if you don't speak Cantonese, they don't give a f**k. Terrible experience, terrible service !
Really good Canto food. Lots of choices and of course has your typical canto dishes. My fav has to be the cage free chicken and the veggie mixed with seafood (mini fried fish, chives, celery) stir fry. I also ordered a simple fried rice dish (finely diced eggs, onions, Chinese sausage, white raisins) which I really enjoyed as well. The food definitely is very delicious, but as usual with Chinese restaurant food they get a bit oily, so I recommend to get a good mix of lightly flavored veggie dish and fried dishes.
The wonton noodle soup, salt and pepper chicken w/ white rice, and the dumpling noodle soup are worth getting here. Service wasn't spectacular but the interior is modern and nice.
It was surprising to see that they had decent prices, food was decent, good variety. We ordered scallion pancakes (M14), Shumai/Shaomai (M11), Pan fried radish cake/ luobuogao (M18), Shanghai fried crude noodles (R8) and Wonton Noodle Soup (N1). Scallion pancakes $1.50 is pretty good in this Flushing area - Radish cake tasted very fresh and not dense. The rest was not much to boast, but the prices made up for it. The Shanghai fried crude noodles did not come out the way their picture showed - the color was off, and it looked like a spicy dish with chili flakes - no chili flakes when the dish came as you can see in the picture.
When its grand opening it was very good, after a few months try try again the good are  getting worse, they use different chef 100%.
Great food! I always try a new dish when I come and I'm never disappointed. The closed for a couple of days for renovation (to move fridge in the kitchen for space). But they are back in business!
the food is the authentic and good for the value. beware of the arrogant and rude valet parker though.
I'm not recommend.  Because I don't really like their service. Also the food taste is so so, why they still can get the many good reviews! Unbelievable! !
HK Cafe in my opinion is somewhere between a 3.5-4 star restaurant. The duck noodle soup is a staple that I enjoy getting whenever I come. The HK milk tea takes a bit long to make, but it's made fresh. Overall all the food is good and comforting, but nothing extraordinary.
Here to order take out. Absolutely a mess. The front desk lady was busy getting orders right for a good ten minutes. Didn't even other if I needed help. Asked other waiters to help, still got no attention. Had to "yell" to get my order placed. Ridiculous.
I went there just to have a quick lunch with my parents. Ordered their famous hk milk tea and some dishes for lunch. Each and everyone of us got diarrhoea after visiting that place
This is one of the places serving good wontons. The soup base is not as salty as the other restaurants which can bring out the taste of the wontons. The fried noodles and fried flat noodles meet the standards.  Too bad that they do not serve E-Fu noodles which is one of my favorite.  The HK style milk tea is a little weak on the tea favor.  Will return to try more dishes...
Ordered a combination rice dish with red roast pork and roast duck. The roast duck pieces were a majority bone and had very little meat. Half of the pork was just fat, and the glaze was way too sweet - almost as if they had added sugar to the regular honey glaze. This was $7.99, definitely not worth it. Saves a trip to Chinatown though since it's one of the few places in Flushing that advertises itself as a Hong Kong style cafe.
The congee and wonton noodle soup here is really good! The prices are pretty cheap and the place is clean. The waitresses were also nice and patient with us
I am giving HK cafe 5 stars  --This use to be me and my family's go to Chinese restaurant when it was Lok Lok. I was really sad when they decided to change it to a steak and sushi restaurant. but they have opened up again and now offering more variety on their menu!Their wonton mein is the best in Flushing - and the sweet and sour pork chop is perfectly fried with the perfect amount of sour and sweet. The wait staff is so attentive and so honest. I went there for dinner last night, and left my wallet at the restaurant. They kept it for me and when I looked in my wallet, NOTHING was missing. All my money is there!This is a must go - and I def will be going back for more! Best part is now they open till 2am and have all the HK cafe yummie dishes, like french toast and baked spaghetti.
I was here around 6, I ordered 1 Milk tea (HK) style, and I'm still in the bathroom, something must be wrong with the milk tea!! Horrible!! Service sucks!! Front desk slow (I was here the first, second week grand opening), waited for so long for just wonton (taste nasty) and beef chow fun, I gave so many chances and I'm sure it will be my XXXXing last chance!! Do not believe all the rating here!! Lok lok originally taste bad and dirty, now I found out it's from lok lok, nah, NO WAY......
We had a large party of 15, with kids and 4 vegetarians. Service was excellent- friendly and responsive. Food was delicious- updated presentations and riffs on classic Cantonese banquet fare. Dishes were bright and naturally flavorful, without excessive salt or MSG. Appetizer platter featured customary jellyfish with sweet & sour daikon pickles, but also not so typical spare rib bits with fried/braised taro dice, and French fry-like fish tempura; but most unusual was crisp-chewy strips of pork bung! Whole chicken, hacked, was perfectly done and tender, steak in just-right bites, and lamb chops (is that Cantonese?) served med-well were juicy and soft with light breaded crust and mushroom/ pepper sauté in the middle. Vegetarians enjoyed excellent Buddha's delight with lotus root, mountain yam, snow peas, and several types of mushrooms, as well as a heaping platter of pea leaves stir fried with goji berries, and light noodle stir fry. Fried prawns coated in a curry-colored creamy sauce was actually a savory salted duck yolk sauce that reminded of Parmesan  cheese - umami! Fried rice finisher had  bits of shrimp and scallops and surprising sweet morsels of golden raisins. New plates changed at just the right times and empty tea and ice water promptly refilled. Live fish tanks were clean and fish looked healthy - a good sign. Heard that they have breakfast (big coffee urns behind counter), and lunch specials that are a real deal. Also observed bubble tea machine shaking up a batch. Decor is modern - lots of glass, open kitchen window, red table clothes (but paper napkins)- and bathrooms pretty clean (although, why do Chinese restaurants have to keep their mops and cleaning supplies in front of bathrooms?!) Valet parking available for a $2 tip - another good deal. New favorite.
The dishes weren't flavorful and not that good. The prices were inexpensive compared to other places though. Won't be coming back.
Husband loves coming here for the lunch special: oxtail over rice with soup and salad. I personally like the rice rolls with hoisin and peanut sauce, not too oily compared to other places and the preserved egg with pork congee (has enough dosage of ginger shreds for my liking )
I had the Shanghai crab soup dumplings and it was The Best in flushing..!!!!!! Their congee is on point because these people used to do sweet and tart the best congee in Manhattan and flushing.. The rest didn't try yet
Previously serving Cantonese comfort food, this restaurant then changed to a steak and sushi place temporarily before thankfully returning to Cantonese food. Parking can be challenging if one wants to find street parking. It's bus-accessible but not subway-accessible. Food is generally solid, including salt and pepper pork chop and the classic chopped chicken with the ginger/oil sauce. HK milk tea is good. Service is typical for these types of places, but our young waitress was particularly indifferent and insolent. She also happened to neglect to add an order and later forgot to make sure another dish came out.  A good meal nonetheless because of the food and the company. Only takes cash.
we were happy to check it out and came back a few times. the good: service is friendly and efficient. large menu and decent tasting foodthe bad: the pictures of the lunch selections have nothing to do with what you get. do not trust lunch special salmon that you on an huge electronic display. the portion is tiny and no asparagus (inspite of advertisement) included.chinese version of the russian borcht is quite tasty, but for some strange reason you can only have it with a lunch selection (which is limited and not really good). we offered to pay for this borcht separately, but they refused to service it. why?also, they charge $1.50 for a tiny bowl of rice. ridiculous! $18 walnut shrimp (tasty but very small portion) and they are too cheap to give you rice with that? wtf? they have bubble tea drinks. most of the time. on a busy saturday afternoon they were out of bubbles. we always order one of their drinks and the quality is inconsistent. the very first time, drinks were great. since then they are getting more and more watery.though quality of food and drinks rapidly declining, it is still a decent place for a family and kids.
