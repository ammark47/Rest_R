It was a toss up between Naked Crab & Claw Daddies.I chose Naked Crab due to location.We parked at the mall next to restaurant. $3.00 for 3 hours.Entered and was greeted at the door. We made it just before happy hour so we got the Cajun wings, grilled oyster & some drinks.The Drinks were tasty and cute in those baggies.The food was tasty, nothing bland everything full of flavor.We got the shrimp and snow crab boil.We added sausages. We got plenty of sausage but each bag only had half a potato and half a cob of corn. Needed more due to that awesome taste of the boil bag. They had an array of sauce and spice level. Medium was perfect enjoyable to give a kick but not overwhelm and take over. I would come back, i would recommend.There was a few patrons from different cultures. I never felt awkward. Give it a try.
Here again for happy hour.There are three of us and they sat us at a 4 top in the middle of the room.Two 4 tops opened up in the corners and we asked if we could move to one of those. At this point we had only ordered one beer.We were told no because it is a busy night and they don't want to move us.That was about 8 mins ago.One of the 4 tops has already filled but the other one is still empty.All we wanted to do was move from one 4 top to another in a different location.I don't see the issue.Plus again, while I was typing this we put in our order and the waitress came back and said they were out of the sauce he ordered.This has happened in the past as you can see from my first review of this place. Oops...2 more 4 tops just opened.I don't like spending my money at places that aren't willing to accomadate me at all.It feels yucky.It wasn't an unreasonable request.And, too many times I've been here we have ordered and minutes later they come back and we are told they are out of what we ordered.Edited:30 mins later and the place is about 50% full and they even sat 2 people at one of those corner 4 tops. When the waitress came by and asked if everything was ok, it felt a bit like a slap in the face.
This seafood spot has fresh seafood ranging from your raw oysters, lobster, crawfish, crab and everything you can imagine from the sea. This place looks very modern with nice large booth, tables and a bar. This is great for a group gathering enjoying fresh seafood bags filled with your favorite seafood. Every boil bag comes with corn, potatoes and rice cakes along with your favorite type of sauces. You pay the boils by the lb, and every single one comes fresh to your table with gloves, plenty of paper towels and a bucket for your shells. My party and I got crawfish which was very good but very minimal for the price you pay for the amount of meat you get from the tails. We got the shabang sauce that was so flavorful! I wish I could put that over some rice and I can call it a meal! The corn was sweet, potatoes and rice cake soaks up all the sauce. The garlic butter shrimp was great as well. They all come with the head on and you can just slurp the juice from the head which is the best part. The wings were pretty good but it was a dry rub and could use some type of sauce. It was crunchy and juicy as well. No complaints here. The fried calamari was crispy and hot but nothing special here. The sweet and spicy, and tomato sauce it came with it was a nice compliment to the calamari. The Cajun fries are a pass because of the portion size for the price you pay. Overall a great experience to get your hands dirty and enjoy great company exploring a delicious seafood boil bag.
I wasn't sure what to expect coming to Naked Crab; first and foremost, it was a lengthy trek for me, especially on Easter Sunday, but the menu was tempting and the reviews were positive, so I made the 1.5 hour trek out.The restaurant is located just a short walk from Main Street Flushing and located within the same building as a hotel. The interior is very spacious, with a few booths for larger groups and plenty of two-tops. I was quickly greeted by a server and given my choice of seating, and he was also kind enough to walk me through their menu and make suggestions. The strength of their menu is in their seafood boils, which allows you to pick your choice of seafood (shrimp, crab, lobster, etc.) and sauce - but the rest of the menu has some tempting seafood-focused entrees and appetizers as well. From the starters, I would recommend their creamy Mac and Cheese as well as the Cajun Wings, which have a slightly spicy seasoning and a crispy outer skin. They're all crowd pleasers, and would make for great bar snacks. From the heavier dishes, don't overlook the Softshell Crab Burger, which is served with a poached egg and avocado, as well as a side of crisp fries.  I also got to try the Crawfish Boil in their signature Naked Sauce, which is spicy, savory, and tart either the addition of lemon, and came with corn and potatoes to help round out the boil. Also - they have a stunning Uni Pasta and Seared Duck Breast which I'd recommend to anyone looking for more unique, elevated dishes that you wouldn't find elsewhere in Flushing.Would love to return with a bigger group to try out more of the menu, but definitely glad I made the trek to Flushing!
So first let me say my family is picky! The service was great, food was delicious. A lot of places I go to, only the server will help you, but here, anyone we saw was asking if we needed anything. We had lemonades & first kiss to drink. All were good. For starters, shrimp cocktail, Cajun fries, & lobster Mac & cheese. To eat my father had salmon which he said was perfectly seasoned and cooked. My mother & I shared 2lbs of snow crab & 2lbs of headless shrimp in garlic butter. I also had a pound of crawfish Cajun. Everything tasted fresh & cooked perfectly. Even the corn & potatoes. The atmosphere is nice. Not too loud but still nice for a family with a 1 year old. We will be back. Just wish there was more parking options but that isn't their fault. We parked at the mall around the corner. Paid $3 which isn't bad at all but it was a bit of a walk for my mother who uses a cane.
I came here on Valentine's Day and made reservations just in case this place was packed.  It was packed.  You can make reservations via Yelp and set up a reminder text/email which is convenient. Ordered the bone marrow pasta, two boils (shrimp and mussels) and (lobster and clams).  The boils were covered in mild "naked sauce" which is a combination of all their sauces that they have.  The food was hot and not overcooked.  The downside of my visit was we waited almost an hour for our boil.  Not sure why it took that long, perhaps my order was forgotten or the kitchen was extra busy.  Our waiter was apologetic and gave us a green tea tiramisu on the house, which was definitely a nice touch and made us forgive them for the long wait.The Naked Crab is spacious and a nice restaurant to bring a date.  I'll be coming back soon to try other items on their menu.
Loved this place ! The food was so yummy , decor modern and clean , staff very friendly - My favorite dish was the uni pasta, aweeeemazing. Very creative drinks and cocktail menu. Would definitely go back
Was craving for Cajun seafood so I yelped around and found this place. Tried and might not come back again.HH oyster: 5/5 VERY FRESH. 1$ each Sliders: 4/5 comes with short rib, fried oyster and eel. Short rib was very FLAVORFUL. Fried oyster needs more work, lack of flavor -- needs some sauce or seasoning. Feel like it's simmered rather than fried. Eel was delicious with the eel sauce .Shrimp w/ shabang sauce: 3.5/5 the shrimps was tiny and the portion was soo small -- doesn't look like 1lb at all. Came w corns and potato w/ no additional charge. The shabang sauce was delicious -- has a nice lemon spicy kick to it; recommend getting/trying the sauce.Snow crab legs w/ garlic butter: 2.5/5 the legs was super tiny - there were barely any meat inside. One of my friend leg didn't have any meat at all. Garlic butter sauce has a very intense garlic smell but was lack of flavor. VERY DISAPPOINTED EXPERIENCE. For the food, portion size and the service it wasn't worth the overall total. There were 3 servers on the floor and it wasn't busy at all but it was soo hard to flag down someone.  Not too sure if we came on the wrong night but never coming back for the boil at all. Probably just for the HH oysters.
This place is okay. I haven't been to much boils but I had better. Also, better homemade of course. Tried the garlic noodles. Not the best. But still tasty. Especially for those who loves cheese. They put a good amount of Parmesan on top. To the point it overpowers the garlic taste and kind of drying?Grilled corn with cheese. Get it. It's different from your Mexican style elote but similar. I liked the mayo they used. Something that really popped out. For the boil, I think it was decently priced. Not sure. They didn't have crawfish because it wasnt in season. Noooooooooooo. What's the point of a boil if not crawfish?! Tell me. So I got clams and mussels. Pound each. I couldn't afford or didn't want the other stuff. I got it in Cajun spicy. Cajun flavor was weird. It wasn't bad. But not the Cajun I know. Unless the spicy made it taste off. Speaking of spicy, the spicy is spicy! But goes away decently fast when you're done eating. Can't believe I was thinking about getttjnf the Carolina reaper spice. I should've gotten medium. I wasn't able to enjoy my boil after finishing 2/3 because I was getting the sniffles. Service seems like a hit or miss here. Our waitress seemed to ignore us or walk passed up several times and we are trying to get her attention without being rude. Wasn't busy either. But this guy refilled my water and even popped in a straw for me because he saw me struggling. He was really nice. I don't like how you have to order full pounds or don't have a deal or combo set (at least not that I know of).  I would come back for happy hour and maybe try butter garlic next time.
I'm still thinking about the grilled clams I had two days ago. So good! The oysters (blue points) were very fresh. The grilled oysters were probably my least favorite. Happy hour is very worth it here. The sauce (naked sauce) for the boil was also really good as well. It's a mix of 3 of their sauces including garlic butter and lemon pepper. Glad I found a local spot I can come to in Flushing for fresh seafood. Also the creme brûlée is amazing surprisingly!Parking sucks but it's Flushing so it is what it is. Service is a bit slow, the servers were very nice. Perhaps they were understaffed?
1. Come in for happy hr bc 1$ oysters and chicken are always great! The grilled oysters are soo addicting and drinks are actually really good. I normally feel a little something something after the 1st one but i always end up getting another one haha. Must be the alcoholic in me...2. We ordered 2 lbs of shrimp in the mild naked sauce but we should of gotten medium naked sauce bc we like a little kick but still great.3. Foir graas was good but everytime i get it i do not eat the apple sauce thats underneath it. If u dont like fatty stuff dont get it.4. Truffle pasta was a nice touch. They freshly grate it in front of you. Tip: stir it and let it sit for a min nd the truffle taste will really come thru.5. Lamb and steak was also great. Ordered it in a medium rare. Cooked to perfection.6. The 10$ a piece kobe/wagyu risoto was amazing. They come and torch the beef infront of you and sprinkle a little bit of salt. Just something everyone needs to try.7. Green tea tiramisu was good it was really thick... like unexpectedly thick. But non the less it was good not the best.8. Green tea brule is my go to at any rest. The brule here i gotta say isnt the best. The glass jar they prepare it in isnt quite ideal. I think its too much... the ratio of the sugar on top to the egg custard is off. I think if they changed the container and make the egg custard a little less then it would be perfecttt.
Nothing special here.  I should of known better when I saw the extensive menu.  I came with party of 6.  The place is small, inside of the Parc Hotel flushing. We started with oysters.  Even though they had about over 20 kinds of oyster posted, they only had 5 available.  2 people in our group order oysters, about 2 dozen total.  When the oyster came out, it was 5 minutes between the 2 dozens.  The place was not busy and they had 3 servers so why they couldn't bring it together boggles the mind.  Also the oysters were totally tasteless!  Waste of money here!For the main course we ordered 2 lbs of shrimp and 1lb of squid with the house sauce medium spice.  If you ever had "boils" before, you know the sauce is everything!   Well, the sauce here is underwhelming.  It was too much tomato and not enough butter.  I tried my friend garlic butter and it was bitter, too much Cajun seasoning.  On top of that, the squid they used was like the left overs from cleaning the squid.This place is very disappointing so go to Shaking Crab few blocks away and skip this impostor!
Came on tonight looking for sea urchin sashimi, although it was up on the menu they had none. Totally upsetting, service was ok, nothing great. We had a sampler of oysters west coast and east coast, 2 dz for the table of 6ppl. The oysters were too cold, so cold that we all agreed that we couldnt really taste the flavor of each oyster individually.  We ordered 2lbs of the shrimp and 1 pound of squid all boild with mild sauce on the side.  The boil came with potato, corn and rice cakes. IMO the rice cake was a filler and the squid was more like the left overs of the day. The star of the boil were the shrimp.  Overall our bill was about $325 b4 tip. Server was nice, most likely this will be a 1 time deal. Highly overrated.
This is one of my favorite restaurant in Flushing. I think people love this kind of food will really love this place but oppositely will not come back again. I went here multiple times with different people. A few say not their cup of tea would not come back. some really love it. You have to give it a try. I love not just their boil seafood and raw seafood, I also love their dishes like the duck salad is my favorite. Surprisingly the dessert also not bad. The price is relatively high compare to Flushing Chinese restaurant. I would say $40-50 is needed per one person if you want eat a variety of different of food. Can not come very often or will hurt my poor wallet ha. but definitely one of my recommended place in Flushing.
This place is great , came with my family and we enjoyed everything. They had a seafood bag with Crab legs , Shrimp and all the sides. I had the lamb chops and they were awesome.  A big thank you to our waitress Amanda was excellent.
I had the most random craving for a boil and yelped some around the area. I was intrigued by the reviews and pictures - I bookmarked Naked Crab and patiently waited for a good evening to come by for their happy hour (everyday of the week from 4pm-7pm). It was very easy to make reservations via the yelp app. In fact I made the reservation less than an hour before I went on a Sunday and every reservation time was available. Nice!We arrived at 5:30pm and it was completely empty. It did start to fill up shortly after 6pm though. Ambience is great. Music was loud enough to drown out yelling babies but low enough to be able to have a conversation. Very children friendly and even had high chairs. Regular menus are given and a QR code which you can scan with your smartphone to see images of the food on the menu. They do not give a happy hour menu so be sure to ask about what they have. Apparently it is written outside but I didn't pay attention. Happy hour had some great deals such as $1 raw oysters, $1.50 grilled oysters or clams, $1 Cajun wings, and some drink specials. We ordered 12 raw oysters, 12 grilled oysters and 6 clams, 8 Cajun wings, garlic noodles, bone marrow pasta, clam pasta, shrimp boil with garlic butter sauce, and the garlic bread. All that plus one soda costed us $150 after tax and tip. This is to share amongst 3 people and it was just about right in terms of the amount of food.- Raw oysters: Decent size. Fresh. So worth it.- Grilled oysters/clams: These were very yummy. I surprisingly preferred the clams because it was more meaty. Ugh, writing this review is making me hungry.- Cajun wings: These were good. $1 - What's not to like?!- Garlic noodles: Yelp did not do me wrong. These were highly recommended in the reviews and it was dee-licious. Best of all the noodles and pasta dishes we ordered without a doubt.- Bone marrow pasta: The bone marrow were roasted well. Buttery, flavorful. The pasta itself was slightly overcooked and the sauce tasted like from a can of Chef Boyardee. Not worth the price tag. Stick with the seafood.- Clam pasta: These were just okay. Nothing special. Again, not worth the price tag. - Shrimp boil with garlic butter: One pound of shrimp came with one piece of corn. I wish the boils come with sausages without the extra cost. Sauce was tasty.- Garlic bread: These were sad little creatures. Absolutely not worth $5. Not enough garlic on it to be remotely garlicky. But honestly people probably order this to dip in the boil sauce anyway. Never again.The service was absolutely fantastic. Everyone was very friendly and there were plenty of smiles to go around. We were greeted as we came in and thanked as we left - I really felt appreciated as a customer! I was a little upset at one point though when someone took away the boil sauce when I turned around because I was still dipping the garlic bread in it. Saaadd face. I would definitely come back in the future when I am craving some good seafood, but probably only when the happy hour is in effect because they have some really good deals. The regular menu prices are not cheap to say the least. Luckily, there is a 5% cash back for dining here if using a credit card you've registered on yelp!
Restaurant has about 15 tables.  Foie Gras was ok. Uni Pasta was decent.  Raw Clam was a little sandy and decent.  Raw Oysters were fresh.  We liked the flavorful Bone Marrow a lot.  Good service.
It's not a secret that I love seafood...but this place didn't do it for me overall.  I did have a nice meal but was disappointed at the quality of seafood I ordered.  The regular snow crab legs were way frozen so it tasted more like the ice/water.  On that alone, I would have given this place 2.5 stars.But they did redeem themselves with other menu items.  My bestie and I ordered the bone marrow and chicken wings...yes, neither were seafood dishes.  The bone marrow was good ... nothing special but still worth mentioning for those that want to try it.  The chicken wings were flavorful but not memorable.  At any rate, wasn't here to eat that stuff...We also had the baked scallop and baked oysters which were pretty big (shell size) and the meat was fairly plump with good seasoning.  That was one of the highlights for the night.  And of course, we ordered a lobster boil (served steamed in a plastic bag with corn on the cob).  My bestie wanted the lemon pepper flavor given she wanted to avoid the usual butter flavor.The funniest thing, the best item of the night was the coconut dessert!  It was a coconut pudding served right in the coconut shell.  Very delicious and refreshing after that meal.  It is also huge...enough to share but we both wanted our own.  LOLOh, one mention, I thought it was funny that I had ordered a passion fruit green tea drink and it was served in a pouch (not a cup) - like a capri sun packaging only clear.  It was a large serving too.I don't know if I would rush to return but if I do, I'll be sure to go when the seafood is more in season (this was mid-October) and go w/ more people so I can sample more stuff.  (My friends went previously and had a better tasting experience than I did).
Saddest happy hour. After ordering a dozen $1 oysters, we tried ordering a second round. The waitress told us they ran out of blue points but we can pay full price for the other oysters they have... Must have been lying to us because we were the only diners in the restaurant and somehow we ate through all the hh oysters?? And it was just bad customer service to offer us no other option but to pay for $3 oysters.I was excited to find a place that serves oysters by my home but I was not impressed. They weren't as fresh as other reviewers have mentioned. We also tried the grilled oysters and they were pretty tasty, I'll give them that.
Came here with the family and was able to park right out front. We got a seafood boil with shrimp and crab legs. Tasty but not memorable. Got the cheesy lobster as well and too expensive in my opinion. The foie gras was good, but the wings seemed over fried. Food was decent, but not spectacular, and due to the high price point, probably won't be coming back.
This place has one of the best services I've experience. Friendly wait staff and informative of specials and promotions. Food is on point. We came during happy hour and raw blue point oysters were fresh and sweet. Tried the grilled oysters and the jumbo grilled oysters as part of their promotion and I gotta say it was delicious! It hit the spot from raw to grill! Ordered some appetizers, garlic bread went well with the grilled oysters and of course the steam shrimps!! Had grilled corn too and Mac n cheese. Environment was family friendly, low lit lighting and casual. Happy hour was great with drinks!! I gave it a 5 star because of service. It matters a lot to have a friendly staff. And of course the food was great and tasteful! To add to it, we also had the eel burger and it was the best!We would have added photos of our main dish but the food just look so delicious we forgot to take the main course photos!!
We arrived on a Saturday night, at around 8PM so we had just missed Happy Hour. Regardless, we ordered a dozen oysters, 6 Kumamoto & 6 Blue Point. The Kumamotos are smaller, meatier and a have a pleasant sweetness to it, which I loved. The oysters were fresh and sand-less! We also ordered 2 grilled corns, which is basically Mexican Elote, and it was so yummy and cheesy. Lastly, we got a side of cajun fries and they were fried to perfection; super crunchy outside yet soft on the inside. As for the boils, we got 1lb of crawfish. You can choose the spice level: mild, medium or spicy, and the sauce. We opted for the 'shabang' sauce, as per the recommendation of our waiter, and boyyyyy was it spicy. If you cannot tolerate spicy foods, please do not get this. Both of our mouths were on fire. In addition, we got the snow crab combo, which consisted of 1lb of snow crab and  your choice of 1/2lb of: shrimp, clams or crawfish. We opted for the shrimp, and this time got the garlic butter sauce, which was a nice cool-down from the 'shabang.' Service was pretty good for a restaurant in Flushing, I was pleasantly surprised. Prices are average for a seafood spot like itself, and I'm glad I don't have to travel to the city for cajun style seafood. Definitely will return during HH!
First time here and decided to test the waters with their happy hour ....It was great!Very fresh and relatively large oysters by majority.And the drinks weren't watered down , so two martinis was great to unwind.
The music is good. Drink isn't bad. The food is good too. I can't complain much. It's okay. Not anything amazing. It's a good date place or with a group.
My friends and I came here on a Thursday night around 10pm and the place was pretty empty. I had had this $30 coupon for months and finally decided to use it. So this restaurant is actually on the first floor of a hotel. It's spacious with lots of fishing theme decoration. The menu starts with raw bar, so the usuals, oysters, clams, crab legs... Appetizers, soup, salad, a couple of pasta. They also have a full bar and lots of cocktails. We started off with an Oyster Sample plate, which had 6 oysters. It was okay to me. I prefer the small ones. We had Grilled Clams, Shrimp Avocado Salad, and Mushroom Cream Soup. Grilled clams were fine. The salad was kinda weird and I don't like it. The soup was too oily. The Squid Ink Pasta with Seafood was odd and a bit sour. Overall I think the food was dissapointing. The owner was really nice tho. But sadly I wouldn't come bank. p/s: lots of clean, roomy restrooms for you ladies
Grilled Oysters, place and service 5 stars.55555555555555555555 55555555555555555555555555...........................................................................................................................................
The service was great. But I thought the portions to be extra small for the pricing. After the appetizers We ordered crab legs and shrimp. Both of which  tasted great. But it only had a 2" piece of corn and half of a potato in the boil. Hardly enough to subsidize all that seafood.
This place has happy hour! Last time we got the grilled oysters and wings. They also offer a free "jumbo" oyster if you share their video via facebook. I thought the actual boil was ok. found it lacking in flavor. The waiters are friendly and attentive though. Fries are on point as well as their burger.
This is a cool place to check out once, I came sometime in the first week of January 2018. It is a nice restaurant if you were staying in the hotel that it is connected to but with so many similar cuisines in walking distance nothing really stands out with this place. It's a Cajun seafood place but I was unimpressed by the sauceThe lobster mac and cheese was very cute, it came with in a cute hotplate. The Cajun wings tasted good but nothing specialThe best part for me was the oyster sampler which I asked the waiter which oyster was which. When he got back to me it was rather rushed and very low so I was unable to clearly hear what he said.ordered for a family of 4:appetizer: mac and cheese lobster and Cajun wingsraw bar: oyster sampler (6)entree: some unmemorable pastaboil: 2 pound of seafood and 1 pound of mussels
This restaurant is definitely a little out of the way from the crowded area of Flushing but if you're already doing some shopping at Skyview, consider coming here for dinner afterwards. Also, consider parking in Skyview because it's almost impossible to find street parking nearby ($3 for 3 hours).It wasn't very crowded when my party of 3 arrived on a Sunday night for happy hour, and when I left at around 8pm, there were still a few empty tables. Regardless if it's crowded, it's a spacious restaurant and it looks like they can accommodate big parties. Happy hour is everyday from 5-7pm and so worth it. They have a good selection of $6 cocktails, $1 fried wings and oysters and $1.50 grilled oysters. They have a lot of options on their menu so it's not just seafood. But obviously, we had to get the seafood boils because we wanted the full experience of eating with gloves, a bib and getting messy! We ordered a pound of snow crab and clams combo with the naked crab sauce. It was delicious!! The sauce had a kick to it but it was not overwhelming and not too salty. The snow crabs were very meaty and came right off. We ended up ordering some Cajun fries to dip into the naked crab sauce, so good!The service was fast and efficient. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're craving for seafood or The Boil, but you don't want to travel all the way to Manhattan and wait 40 minutes for a table.
Located next to Skyview mall. Parking available outside, but can only fit around 4-5 cars, meanwhile they can seat probably close to 100 ppl inside.  You can make reservations on Yelp, but actually didnt need to make any. Table for 5 ppl on a Saturday 6pm, and we were practically the 3rd group inside.  Food :Calamari Parmesian Corn 1 lb Shrimp boil (garlic butter)Dungeness Crab + crawfish (Naked sauce) Garlic noodlesCajun friesIve had better sauce for the cajun seafood bags, but thats not to say it was bad here. For us, we didnt think it was enough sauce and it didnt stick well to the seafood. Not a big deal, just dip it into the bag again after peeling. The garlic noodles were delicious! We ended up getting another one of those at the end. Very spacious, and lots of tables and room to walk. The staff is friendly and patient. I just wish that there were more televisions other than the 3 right next to each other at the bar. I wanted to follow the mets game while I was eating.
Love the environment and the food. During happy hour, don't miss the $1 oyster and their garlic noodles are so delicious! My girlfriends and I often meet here after work for some drinks and the Cajun dishes. Dig in
The happy hour is great! $1 oysters are incredibly fresh and all the drinks are extremely tasty.On the regular menu, I don't think you can go wrong with anything. I've been here a couple of times, and have tried almost everything. The black truffle pasta, along with the steak and the Rack of Lamb are marvelous. Everything is cooked to perfection and all the sauces are so delicious they'll leave you wanting more.As for the boils, my favorite sauce is hands down the black pepper sauce. Although it's $2 extra, it's worth every single penny. Other than the black pepper sauce, the Naked sauce is another one of my personal favorites. I would definitely come back and 100% recommend it to all my friends
I had such a great time here.The staff were friendly and attentive; my friend and I were seated right away when happy hour started and there were only a few other people in there.Happy Hour specials include 6 dollar cocktails, 5 dollar beer/wine, 1 dollar oysters and 1.50 baked clams/mussels. The cocktails are Game of Thrones themed and come in an adult Capri Sun bad so they stay untainted and grabbable while you eat. If you're a tequila fan, I highly recommend the Red Wedding. If you're into vodka? Hit a Khaleesi. Both were tasty and well-poured. (Props to the bartender, who was also friendly. Thanks!)We ordered oysters and baked clams as appetizers, simple and delicious. We ordered a 2lb boil bag and were not disappointed. We went with the garlic butter and mild spice and the clams, crawfish and shrimp were all phenomenal. There was more than enough to take home for left overs too-- to which they included a pair of gloves.We finished off with Creme Brûlée and Coconut Pudding-- both were excellent. The coconut is served cold in a coconut, and was delicious. The Creme Brûlée is warm and just perfect.Overall, had a great time. Will be coming back for my birthday dinner next month. Can't wait!
While checking out new restaurants in Flushing, Naked Crab was one of them and there was a Groupon deal so I decided check it out. The restaurant was new and clean. I ordered lobster combo boil with medium garlic butter sauce (I usually get spicy but the waiter said the medium level is spicy so I followed with his advice, which turned out to be a smart choice - even the medium level is spicy), hoping that it's as good as the one I had at The Boil Restaurant in Manhattan. Unfortunately, I couldn't see any chunks of garlic and I tasted lots of curry flavor. I'm not saying it was bad, it just wasn't as good as I expected. As for the customer service, the servers didn't come out of the kitchen area often so I had to wait to ask for a bill. I also had to ask for a crab fork so that it's easier to eat the lobster meat, but shouldn't the server have a common sense and bring it out with the dish before I ask? Nonetheless, I'm still giving 4 stars because the food was decent and the servers were nice when I got to talk to them. Definitely order a bowl of rice ($3) to mix with the sauce if you order the book menu!
Cuisine: 7Service: 6Decor: 7Value: 6Overall: 7Just another Cajun boil restaurant? Not really. The chef here must have been professionally trained because he makes great fancy appetizers and entrees that most other boils don't. Obviously most people come in here for the big bags of seafood, but I wouldn't ignore rest of the great food on the menu.So far, I have been here twice in 3 days and here are the things we have tried.Foie Gras - 8 Seared well, but rest of plate just okMuchroom Soup - 8 Creamy & flavorful, excellentRaw Oysters - 7 Good east & west cost selectionLobster Sashimi - 7 Fresh but soy sauce was too saltyPrime Sirloin Steak - 7 Very juicy but a bit priceyShrimp Boil - 7 Large shrimps, garlic butter yumSnow Crab Boil - 6 Little bit overcooked but decentKing Crab Boil - 3 Definitely overcooked & overpricedFood and decor are the strong points at this restaurant. Where they are somewhat weaker is service and price. Actually, the owner, hostess and bartenders were extremely friendly. Unfortunately their servers are quite forgetful (Again, lemons for the oysters please.) and don't come around to check us regularly (Water glasses were always empty). As for the price, most of it seems reasonable, but $38 for the sirloin seems steep when I can go to a Manhattan steakhouse and get a much larger portion for a few dollars more. Also, other Cajun boil places price their king crab legs around $28-33/lb. Why so high?Anyway, minor complaints aside, I do like the ambiance (minus the really loud music) and the variety of food available for a restaurant in downtown Flushing. Considering there is Skyview Mall parking right on the next block, it's likely that Naked Crab will see me again in the near future.
Not typically a seafood person, but their food was delicious. Must say though, my favorite thing was the Lobster Mac n Cheese!
Must try their Grilled Lobster with cheese and the Duck Breast also the Rack of Lamb! There's so many other things I'd like to try from their menu but I'm still obsessed with those three dishes, so I usually end up ordering those every time I go. The service is satisfactory and the place is clean! They offer a variety of seafood and they are all fresh.  What more can u ask for?
Let me start by saying, I love a good boil! So when my mom first mentioned me about Naked Crab, I was on the fence about it because finding a place that has awesome food/ boils is tricky to find in Queens. I made a Yelp reservation for 4 (because no body likes to wait) and the second we got there, we were seated!  What we ordered: -dozen oysters -shrimp cocktail (5 per order, we had to order another) -garlic noodles (it was so good, we ordered one more) -three snow crab + shrimp boil ( garlic butter + cajun sauce) *check out my tip below! -one lobster + shrimp boil (cajun spicy) The ambiance is great, they play great music, the staff is super attentive and great knowledge about their raw fish.My mom asked if they clean the lobster before serving it, and they don't (bummer) What they do is, boil the completed lobster as a whole and serve it as is, you can ask them to cut it down the middle though. The boils itself were very tasty! However the sauce didn't stick much to the shrimp and crabs that after cracking and cleaning, I found myself dipping the crab meat into the sauce. I mean who doesn't love drenching their food into bomb ass sauce. i can keep going, but an over all great experience and will defiantly be going back!
This place is consistently good. I've been here around 10 times now and the salmon, boils, lobster roll, and lamb are all very good! I especially recommend the Shabang sauce for the boil, very tasty.Today I tried the squid ink pasta with seafood. It was okay but the mussels literally seemed like they were taken off the beach and thrown straight Into the pasta; sand and all. I could understand a bit of sand but this was a mouthful of sand. Hopefully they fix this issue because everything else is great.The male waiter we had was also extremely friendly and attentive!
I love seafood. Always interested in trying boils and steam pots. Heard about this place, lucky for me Groupon had a deal. We made reservations (just in case). The place is nice and cozy. Staff were attentive. The drinks were yummy. I ordered a Khalessi which was so good, light, crisp and sweet. For their boils, they have a few choices for sauces and heat level. I chose the spiciest Cajun. It was pretty hot. Extra $2 but worth it if you you love heat. A lb of crab legs were ordered, heat level of just "spicy" which was really good. The shrimp are larger than that of Joe's Crab Shack. The crab had enough meat. They give you gloves to eat with. I rolled my eyes about it but my hands felt the heat after. My hands burned for 2 days after dinning in. That's how hot the Carolina option was. (I love spice so worth it for me). I would def go again.
I will give them credit for a nice ambiance ...  The food does taste pretty good. I just wish it was a bit more food and that they had more veggie options. The waiters were nice and offered us a promo go like the a photo from a free oyster . It was a huge oyster ..im sure if i ate oysters it would be awesome. We got it anyway. It was seasoned real well. It was a nice place to try. The wings were delicious and they put lightbup ice cubes in your drink..cute.
Decided to give this place a try and I was so disappointed. Literally came in, sat, and left. Came here with a few seafood cravings and they had NONE. Nope. How can a seafood restaurant not have seafood??? Probably why the place was empty since they had no seafood.
Awesome food. Awesome service. Must do again! We shared the bone marrow, lamb dish and a boil of snowcrab with sausage YUM!
Awesome place! Loved the seasoning! The service was great. The waitress came back several times to make sure we was okay. The price was reasonable and worth it. I definitely will go there again. The place is very spacious and comfortable.
Had great time here, it was intimate, quite, wound out staying for like two hours. It was rainy and icy out so we were literally 1 of 4 tables being used our entire stay. The staff was friendly, attentive, all in all an enjoyable experience. My only criticisms are (and this one likely can't be helped) the aroma of all the seafood is extremely potent. It can literally knock you off your feet! Second critique is their choice of paper menus, they were smudges and food stains on them. Overall that's just esthetically unappealing, and it comes off as cheap. And the menus also lack pictures of any kind, the food served looks great, why not incapacitate that?!
My husband and I have been here couple times, the food is always consistently good!  I always asked the servers for recommendation and they never disappointed.
I came here before 5pm.  After I walked in, I was not seemingly welcomed.  No greetings by anyone in the restaurant.  The owner just put me in the corner.  I had to wait and wave at the waiter to get my order.  But it's only until I finished my food, I realized I was never given anything not even water to drink.  He never asked me.  After he took my order and told me no problem full-filling it he only came back later to tell me they don't have it.  I don't believe it because they just opened at 4pm and it's a holiday they must prepare for it.  I don't believe they don't have sea urchin for the whole night.  My guess is they are leaving it to group customers later who booked the table for expensive package price.  Also, they cancel the happy hour specials just by saying because it's a holiday.  It really sucks that I had to deal with this nonsense.  Food is ok very small portion.  Lousy service.  I left with an empty stomach.  Will only return if there is promotion.  My suggestion to the restaurant is:  If you can not afford a promotion, then don't do it at all.  Please don't play the customers then nickel and dime your gain or loss.
Came here purposefully for the happy hour. I had quite a few raw and grilled oysters that were so good and fresh. I only thought the grilled ones were a little bit salty. I would still get it again. I also got the shrimp cocktail which I don't think I would get again. It was decent, not bad but not great either. Overall, I enjoyed my experience.
Loved this place! I ordered the sky view drink and it was delicious ! I ended up having 2And I order a snow crab leg and headless shrimp in garlic butter sauce medium it came with corn and potatoes I loved it! It was so flavorful I was very pleased with the mealAlso my waiter and waitress where great! Nice and didn't seem like I bothered them when I called them over Only bad side was the $1 Wings kinda sucked and there's barely parking but even with those cons I would so go back again!
I came here one evening with a friend of mine for dinner. When we arrived, it was fairly empty, but it got more and more crowded as time passed. They were also hosting a party of some sort as well. At times, it was hard to talk because it was so loud. We got an order of garlic bread, a dozen oysters for appetizers, the eel burger and lobster mac & cheese. I loved the garlic bread and eel burger. The lobster mac & cheese didn't have a lot of lobster, but it was still delicious. The oysters ended up making my friend nauseous and caused stomach pain after a few hours.
Love , simply love the food here .. Seafood is absolutely fresh which is really important to me !!  Took my 16 years old nephew here , and he enjoyed so much .  He is such a picky eater as most of the 16 years olders ,  but he said that this is one of his favorite!
We were craving for cajun seafood but plans didn't work out so we had to make dinner plans around Queens. I ordered Eat24 for pick-up at Naked Crab and everything went smooth. The guy at the door greeted me and directed me to the bar for pick-up. Honestly, the food wasn't really as good as The Boil. We ordered the Calamari appetizer, it was mostly breading and too salty. We also got 2lbs of shrimp with the cajun sauce. It was lacking flavor and not as tasty as I hoped. Maybe we'll try a different sauce next time but definitely not the cajun.
The best Uni pasta and Duck Salad I've ever tried in my life!!! Came here on a Wednesday night with my friends and we were impressed with everything.  We ordered raw oysters,  cajun fries,  garlic bread, avacado salad, duck salad, uni pasta, 2 pounds snow crab legs and shrimp. Staffs were extremely friendly.They also have happy hours from 4pm to 7pm.  If you are in Flushing and don't know where to go, give Naked Crab a try! This is a true gem!  I'm definitely coming back again!
Booked this place via Yelp on the same day for a party of 3 for 8:30pm. This was for a Friday evening dinner. I have never been to this place or any other seafood boil places to begin with. I didnt have any expectations or whatsoever.  We drove up to the restaurant and to our surprise, there is actually parking. there is about 5-6 (or less actually) spots on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. Friday night dinners in flushing is no joke when trying to find a parking spot. We attempted street parking and if there wasnt a parking lot/space, we would have went to sky view. Its only 2 blocks away. We walk in, and it was practically empty. The place was bigger than I expected and I certainly thought it would have been packed being Friday night and prime time dinner time. But thats not to say the place isnt good that people are not returning. We get to a table and check the menu. Staff was pretty friendly. You choose your seafood or choice and the sauce you want. Its self explanatory. There was 3 of us so we ordered 3 different kinds of seafood and sauce. Snow Crab legs in garlic butter - this was probably my favorite of the three sauce. Garlic and butter combo is good on anything actaully, its a sauce/combo that cannot go wrong. Red Crab in Shabang sauce - this is their spicy sauce, which is mainly made of sriracha. It was ok. The meat on the red crab was a tab mushy. I wasnt a fan of the texture. I also am not a fan of spicy so this was my least favorite of the 3. Dungeness Crab in Naked Sauce, this is their house/special sauce which is a combo of all the sauces mixed together. To me, it was a tad on the lemon/salty side. The crab though was very tender and meaty, my favorite of the seafood. All in all, it was pretty good but it can become rather salty towards the end. I would go again.
Amongst an influx of cajun/boil type restaurants in the NYC area, The Naked Crab does it a lil different but right. We started off with their grilled oysters, grilled corn with cheese, their bone marrow, garlic noodles, and lobster roll. Each dish was excellently executed, hot, flavorful, and delicious. We opted for the clam boil, mildly spiced with plenty of butter and garlic. The boil included the usual, corn and potatoes and a twist with their inclusion of rice cakes which are chewy, tasty and an enjoyable addition to the boil bags. The drinks are well made, not too strong and come inside the coolest, zip lock drink style bags. The crowds will be coming soon to this place, they're doing just about everything right.
A curiously scandalous name... and, perhaps, a bit inaccurate.  Let's think about this for a second; are crabs' shells what one could call clothing?  Because if that's the case, then the crabs here aren't naked (they come with the shells on).  But, if a shelled crab is considered "naked" for purposes to suit the namesake of this establishment, then I suppose it wouldn't be inaccurate... but if a shelled crab can't be considered a clothed (or non-naked) crab, then does it make sense that all shelled creatures are naked even with their shells?Well, that took longer than it rightfully should have... anyway, this place does serve crab.  Hell, crab is the linchpin that brings notoriety to this place; and by crab, I mean crab that's served in the fashion of being in big plastic bags filled with crab parts, corn, sausage, shrimp, and potatoes... all things being doused in a buttery/spicy/lemony/salty sauce concoction of your choice.  As far as these Cajun boil bags are concerned, the ones found here don't command the premium pricing that one would find in the city... and that's just fine with me, this stuff gets the job done just as effectively (and Hell, maybe even a bit better).In addition to the signature bagged seafood selections (which also include shrimp, squid, crawfish, and other things I'm not naming because I don't know/remember), they have a number of other foodstuffs that you can order and eat like a civilized human being (i.e. with a spoon and fork).  The noteworthy item that my party had undertaken the task of eating was the uni pasta.  It was neatly presented in a bowl (in stark juxtaposition to the lack of elegance seen with the seafood bags), and yes, we did eat the pasta with forks... as we're not savages.
The restaurant has a nice atmosphere. The staff there were efficient and pleasant. We were able to book a table for a big group without any problems. The music was a little loud so we couldn't hear what someone said down the table but a little screaming never hurt anyone. The food was good. We ordered everything off the appetizer menu. Nothing bad. The crab roll  was eh the least favorite dish. The crab and shrimp boil naked and Cajun was good. There is parking on the sidewalk in front of the store...only several spots. Otherwise park at the mall. It gets really congested there.
Great food and they have happy hour!! Everything was yum and so filling. Definitely coming back for the clams and lobster.
Came here for happy hour only. $1 oysters are always an attractive deal to me. However, we got a mix of mostly fresh oysters, and some that were not fresh at all. Those left a bad taste in our mouths. I would be careful with seasons when ordering $1 oysters here. The $1 wings are a pretty good deal, and good to munch on while sipping on beer. They put their cocktails in capri-sun like pouches which make them fun to drink! All of their pouch cocktails are worth trying, but all of them taste very strongly of alcohol so beware if you do not like the strong tasting cocktails.
I don't know yet if I'm a fan.  May update this review when I go again.  I'm always worried happy hour (even on weekend!)  oysters aren't fresh.  But this isn't the case with Naked Crab.  We ordered 2 dozen of the Blue Point Oysters and every single one tasted like sea and plump too!  If my review was based on this alone, I'd give it 4 stars.The service was excellent though so I'd give 4 stars on that.The entrees was where I had to take off a few points.Uni Pasta - By far one of the best if not the best Uni Pasta I've had in NYC.  They top it off with what the waiter called "crab eggs" but it's really crab tomalley.  The price of $28 is pretty steep for a small (yet filling and decadent) plate of pasta.  Foie Gras - This was very disappointing actually.  There was just too much salt.  Would stay away from this.Dungeness Crab, King crab legs, crawfish boil.  -  They're good but nothing too special for the price.  Their "Shabang" sauce was too vinegary for our palette.  The Garlic and butter sauce had an off brown/orange color and there's something else in there... but can't quite figure out what it is.I don't mind paying $$$ for great food...but this isn't great.  I'll try it again some time in the near future though...would order something different...but will maybe do 3-4 dozen of the happy hour oysters :)
Don't know that I can speak to their Cajun Bonafides, but otherwise, based on a fairly minimal one pick up order database,I'd be largely inclined towards an enthusiastic thumbs up.Superbly,supremely fresh mostly raw seafood was what I hoped for, and indeed received.Had never before tried  raw lobster, but their lobster sashimi was a glorious revelation of just how good this can be.Not thst the mussels w crudo of shrimp + avocado salad were inferior by any means.Not to mention a very tasty coconut pudding dessert.
loved it, some of the freshest oysters I've had in queens,but the bone marrow was the best!!Its definitely worth a trip.
Fourth time here today. The owner is nothing but entertainment! The happy hour is awesome! $1 for oysters (fresh and juicy) and $6 for cocktails (we ordered 10).I haven't had a chance to try meat yet since I love seafood too much to resist. Had 3+ bags of seafood mix every time I visit. Dessert is super yummy and reasonable price.
I came here on a Sunday afternoon with my friends. When we got there, I was thrilled with the service of the people who worked there. They were very kind and welcomed us. We tried plenty of foods when we were there. I personally LOVE seafood, so everything here was great to me. They had lobster burgers, soft shell crabs, and pastas too! I also tried their seafood boil, and I loved their signature sauce. The portions were very fair too, in my opinion. Their drinks are so fun to drink! Though the thai iced tea was a bit sweet, the light bulbs in them made the drink and experience much more fun! I would definitely go back, and would highly recommend this place to you!
I've been here about 4 times now and I love it here. First of all - AtmosphereBeing in Flushing it's very hard to find a good place to eat with friends without it being packed or nosy. However this place is perfect. My friends and I can spend hours just hanging out here eating oysters and clams. Second of all - Food Food is mostly hit or miss from what I experienced, mostly hit tho. Everything seafood is delicious, burgers and pasta are good too (pastas portion not the biggest tho). Their plain Mac and cheese was a thumbs down for me tho. Go to would definitely be (Happy hour) baked or raw oysters/clams and their boil. Their garlic noodles are really delicious too. I mainly come for these options so if you love seafood this is definitely the place for you. Third - Service Service has always been good, gives you your space but still attentive. We had a big party today and they gave us shots on the house! I think price wise, not during happy hour it can rack up to be quite pricey but during it's a great value. TLDR: 10/10 I hope this place never shuts down lol
This restaurant isn't too hard to miss. It's literally right next to the hotel and a great spot for a lunch or dinner outing after shopping in the Skyview center. Everything from the fresh oysters to the grilled oysters to the lobster roll to the boil were scrumptious. The staff were very quick, attentive and awesome simply put. The prices are very reasonable and they also have an amazing happy hour from 4-7 daily. I'm definitely coming back.
I love these types of seafood places. The food was great. Service was beyond amazing. Waiters are super nice. I'll be coming back again!
All!!!!I can say,ill be backThe food was goodThe drinks was fab,especially the drink callKalesshi,from the game of thronesDon't know if I spelled it right,,but Love the place
Ehhh, over hyped. The boil was great, lobster roll was super small, fries were delicious, Cajun wings delicious, adult caprison should have been filled to the top & woulda been great to take with you.. too bad you can't (I don't see why not) & steak over priced. Won't be back ‍ Our server Jaikia was nice.
If Happy Hour had a fan club, I'd be enrolled. Let me tell you something... I love a GOOD Happy Hour; and this Happy Hour right here is to die for. The grilled oyster(best i've ever had) and the drinks(can't remember what it's called, but it's the first drink on the menu)... amazing! The wings and brussel sprouts could've been better but were still very very good. I'd go back, GLADLY. I'm hoping to try other things on the menu soon... but for now, I'm impressed.
Highly recommended!!!The best seafood I have ever tried in flushing!Snow crab legs are the best.
Went here 1/22/18. Love the music. Beverage of choice: a khaleesi (excellent!!!). Had a seafood boil with shrimp, crab legs, mussels, corn, sausage rice cakes. Complained about mussels (very sandy). Had them removed from the bill with no problem  along with apology from chef. The rest of food was really good. Parking is scarce. I'd go back but would never order the mussels again
I will be returning to naked crab for happy hours. I ordered the $1 happy oysters, Cajun fries, shrimp cocktail, 2 $7 cocktails, and snow crab combo. It totaled into $98 (with tip). The $1 oysters, $7 Capri sun cocktails, and fries were the only thing I was satisfied with. The oysters were extremely fresh and no sand!!! The cocktails were so yummy! The fries were crispy and would be hard for someone to mess up fries. Now, the bad. The shrimp cocktail was $12 for 5 shrimps. They were SMALL to be shrimp cocktails. It is just too expensive for little quantity & size. The snow crab should have been the best thing we tasted since it is kind of the selling point of this place. But no. We got garlic butter but it did not taste like it. I've tried other places like this and garlic butter is usually always good and buttery. This place just had chunks of garlic in the sauce and it was just okay..... not good. Also, the combo comes with 1/2 pound of clam, shrimp or crawfish. We thought it was a good deal but .... we realized we got fooled. Let me explain, the combo was $31. The snow crab itself would be $24/lb & clams $12-13/lb. They make you think you're getting a deal when you're not because it doesn't come with 1 pound of clam!!! Only 1/2 pound!!! And they do not state how much is clams you would be getting on the menu. I only found out because I asked. Over all, I will be returning for only happy hour for the oysters & cocktails. I am willing to try other things on the menus but I will not be getting any of the boils (seafood bags) or the shrimp cocktail again. Thanks for reading my long ass review!! Hope it helped!!
Absolutely FANTASTIC! I was pleasantly surprised with Naked Crab and its offerings. The food was delicious and the service was top notch. They have great happy hour specials from 3pm-11pm and all night if you sit at the bar. You can't go wrong with $1 raw oysters , $1.50 grilled oysters and a variety of drink specials! We were a party of 3 and we started with a few drinks, a dozen oysters, the uni pasta, 3 lbs of seafood boil to share and the creme brulee & green tea truffle dessert. Every single dish offered quality ingredients - the oysters were super fresh, the uni pasta was creamy, yet light and the seafood was beyond flavorful! The creme brulee was probably one of the best I've had (not overly sweet & super creamy)! We were all swept away by the quality of their food and are already making plans for our next visit! It's a true gem in the busy streets of Flushing and I couldn't be happier to welcome the good eats and great service offered here.Shout out to Nelson, the manager/owner, who really knows the importance of quality customer service. He was friendly and attentive from the start of our Naked Crab experience and throughout! I can't wait to go back!PS - Decor/Food/Service is on point here! You really don't feel like you're in Flushing when dining here. WAY BETTER than THE BOIL! TWO thumbs up to the staff!
Came here on a weekday for dinner and we were seated right away. The atmosphere in this restaurant makes you forget that you are in the middle of flushing. I had my eye on the Uni pasta but they didn't have uni the day I went, so we settled for the bone marrow pasta that they recommended. We also ordered the crab cake for appetizer, 1lb of crawfish in Cajun sauce medium spice, and 1lb of shrimp in the butter garlic sauce mild. (If you are up for a challenge there is a option for Carolina reaper). Crab cake had a poached egg on top but tasted like the frozen crab cakes. The bone marrow pasta was nothing exciting and definitely not worth the price! However, the boils was delicious their sauces were so flavorful! The seafood in the boils were also very fresh.
Great place! The seafood was fresh, service prompt!, and waiters were very nice. I had the garlic bread, fried calamari, shrimp balls, and the snow crab and shrimp combo boil! Me and my bf left satisfied and full! -update! 2nd time here and it was just as delish! Not only that but the owner was soo nice and charged my phone! Calamarie was amazing! Corn was great! Everything about naked crab is amazing!!
My boyfriend and I came to Naked Crab during a slight snow storm so there weren't a lot of people and we were seated right away. We ordered the shrimp in naked sauce (medium) and snow crab in naked sauce (mild). naked sauce is a combination of the three sauces: cajun, garlic butter, and lemon pepper. I would recommend getting medium instead of mild for more flavor. the food came out in a timely manner and my oh my, it was delicious! my boyfriend wore a thick sweater and his sleeves kept rolling down, so one of the waiters came by and rolled it up for him - haha! I would definitely come here again. the food was great, the service was 10 out of 10, and it's very affordable.
Food was good  we made mistake of ordering spicy though. Crying  inside. Took the rest home to clean off spicy and eat.  first time here. Lesson learned.
2nd time coming to this place and its still just as delicious! Hubby and I love the crab legs!! My cousin had the soft shell crab burger which she said was delicious!  I def love that they play r&b/hiphop too!! Sooo coming back for more!
Ate at the bar for all night HH. The bars have hooks for your things so it's not so inconvenient!The service is fast and friendly. The place was pretty empty on a Wednesday night, but no complaints.We tried the garlic noodles, oysters, mac & cheese, chicken wings, grilled clams, and cajun fries. The garlic noodles are definitely better than Claw Daddy's in the city. They're kind of sweet-garlicky. You can't go wrong with oysters (they give lemon & cocktail sauce), but some of them got a little gritty. Chicken wings were a little saltier than I prefer, but were super crispy. The garlic butter sauce on the grilled clams was great. You can't go wrong with fries either.And we had so many choices of wine to pick from. Two types of white, two types of red, and a sparkling, if I'm remembering correctly.We stayed for like 3 hours or something, but no one seemed to mind. It's a little out of the way for the Main St. area, but definitely one of the best HH deals around, not just in Flushing. Will definitely go back!
One of my friends recommended this spot. I gotta say the seafood here was extremely fresh.I and my friend had the Snow Crab combo with Shrimps with the oyster sampler. The oysters are good and shrimps were delicious.The crabs were not flavorful. It is not worthy for the price.
This restaurant hasn't been opened for too long and there's definitely a lot of potential. For an establishment that hasn't been around for too long, they honestly deserve more credit and attention. It's located in the building where the Parc Hotel is, which is right next to Skyview. The restaurant is super easy to miss, but you can park there easily once you find it! It's the gray building on College Point Boulevard. First off, the service here is amazing and the food here is just as stellar. There's barely any Cajun seafood places in Queens and the ones that have been in Flushing in the past were complete trash. The RAW OYSTERS were realllllllly good! We ordered a dozen oysters and they were all shucked nicely and they were super meaty and flavorful. The GRILLED OYSTERS AND CLAM were terrific too. Like the ones from the raw bar, they were just as meaty as well (a little on the tougher side since they're cooked, but with the butter and everything, it tasted delicious!)I loved the FRIED CHICKEN. It was super crunchy and crispy. There was a super generous and even batter to meat ratio! Cajun fries were crispy and super fresh when we got them! The UNI PASTA is a little on the pricey side and uni is an acquired taste for a lot of people. I feel like the uni pasta can use a little work since it wasn't as creamy as I have tried in other places, but it was still yummy and the uni complemented the pasta very well when you mix it in. The SMOKED SALMON SALAD was good, but I wished there was a little more salmon. The salmons were nice and smoky though! Really enjoyed it ^___^! The SHRIMP AND AVOCADO SALAD was great too actually! Not really sure what sauce they drizzled over the salad but it complemented the shrimp and avocado chunks really well. The salads were also very refreshing for a meal like this.We also got the Sirloin Prime, Duck Breast and Lamb Rack. The DUCK BREAST was cooked to perfection! It had a melt in your mouth sensation that left you wanting for more after each bite ^__^ The salad on the side also complemented it really well and was very refreshing. The SIRLOIN PRIME was cut in very big chunks, so that got a little overwhelming. We ordered it medium rare, but it was still very enjoyable (had to cut it up into thinner slices though). Usually not a big fan of lamb, so I wasn't gonna eat it at first, but ended up eating and very grateful that I did. The LAMB RACK was very tender and flavorful as well. Thoroughly enjoyed all three entrees. For the BOILS, they're a little smaller than the ones in the city, but the ones in the city are way more expensive too. We had a bit of the shrimps, mussels, clams, snow crabs, lobster, king crab legs. The mussels and clams were actually a lot more meaty than what I'm used to seeing so I was really happy to see that. The shrimp was good, wasn't overcooked or anything (but I feel like shrimp never really gets the flavor of the sauce as well since you have to peel the skin anyway). Lobster was good too. But my favorite was definitely the snow crabs and king crab legs. They're pretty generous with the amount of snow crabs and they're all super meaty. They provide you with bibs, gloves and cracking utensils. You also get the corns, shrimp and potatoes and those usually go with the sauces really well. I believe we had the Naked sauce, which is their own restaurant made sauce, and the Sha-bang sauce in medium! I'm usually not a spicy fan, but I was able to handle it. For dessert, get the CREME BRULEE! They serve it in these mason jars which are pretty cute and the creme brulee itself is a nice finish to such a meal! I guess some people have given this place lower reviews because of the pricing of the food, but good Cajun seafood is really hard to come by in Queens. Also seems like they have pretty good happy hour deals from 5pm-7pm and all night at the bar, so no need to travel to the city for these happy hour deals!!
The foods are good. But!! They are too expensive toward the small amount?? These oysters are not $1 each but $2.5 each. I never saw any oysters like this small. And the beef marrow is so little marrow like nothing...for $10. lol If you are not a big fan Please avoid. The pasta is the only thing I could recommend. Feeling bad for taking my family here... ((
The Naked Crab is not the best seafood restaurant but it's definitely one of the better places to go for lobster and crab legs.There was alot of hype when this restaurant opened but it's definitely not over-rated.Will do a second visit when we're in the Flushing area and in the mood for crabs.
This is a new restaurant and I came across it completely random walking out of the mall. Been here with a couple friends twice for happy hour $1 oysters. They have great happy hour deals. Drinks are great and food is amazing. Their regular entree is a little pricey but their appetizer menu has a lot to offer! The black truffle pasta is absolutely a must as well as their lobster mac and cheese. You won't want it to be over. Don't mind the presentation of the menu... (it's like a filing folder) but it definitely does not reflect the great food and service at this place!
My first time to try this place. Happy hour everyday of the week! Fresh, plump, juicy oysters and the sky view drink came in a pouch that lights up! Will definitely be back and bring family and friends over.
Great sea food and drinks. Seafood always fresh and price is right. Oysters fresh and they have happy hour every day. I keep coming back with my husband. We love this place!
The rate is for service.Here's what happened. I saw a promotion online and I have the coupon for this restaurant and I asked them if I could use it. The waitress said NO first and then she said she could ask (with my phone). When she returned, she said I could use it. Then someone called her and she came back again saying that the minimum amount for using it would be $50. Later I realized the coupon DID NOT even say about the minimum. So obviously, they didn't want to give us the deal. So cheap! Besides that, the food was okay.
The owner is really funny and the environment is great! The food is awesome as well! Taste so much better than the boil in my opinion. They offer great deals for happy hour.
Nice food. Order crab middle hot sauce and  cocktail. And just steam lobster.  They are good.
I literally just walked out from dinner spending $91 on some watered down tasting seafood (granted I also ordered 2 apps and 2 beers). And I also happened to drain a crab claw for a good minute because there was so much water in it that ultimately watered down everything!!Only reason why this review is getting 2 stars is because of the excellent service (restaurant was half empty during Friday dinner service). I guess for the price, you get what you get. After dining at The Boil in Chinatown and The Boiling Crab in Los Angeles this can never compare. We ordered 2 combos of the 1 pound snow crab and shrimp (5-7 pieces of large shrimps) for $28 which came with 2 pieces of corn and potatoes. It is definitely cheaper than the more well known spots but of course the shrimp and crab here were previously frozen. When it came time to peeling the crab, half the meat would rip off with the skin. And the sauce? You're only allowed one sauce per each combo because they put the 2 seafoods together (so it hides the fact that there are barely any shrimps). We ordered a Cajun spicy and a naked spicy. Boy was it watered down. The spiciness was definitely there but there was none of that garlic/lemon taste the servers said there would be. As for the 2 apps, we tried the mac and cheese and Cajun fries. The mac and cheese come shortly after we ordered and was served on a skillet, it was okay. The Cajun fries that I ordered came AFTER our boil came out and it was just your everyday seasoned fries. Once I saw how plain it was I thought they forgot the Cajun seasoning so I asked our server if Cajun spice was suppose to be sprinkled on but she said "no the fries are marinated". Don't come. Don't eat here. I rather fly to LA for boil than  eat here ever again.
Came to see what naked crabs look like. Was bot disappointed at all. Finding parking may be hard. But the atmosphere was nice. It was like a sports bar. I came when there weren't a lot of people but i still enjoyed it here with my girlfriend. Waitresses were friendly and gave suggestions as well. The refreshments like most places were overpriced. The pineapple juice was $3 and it tasted like it came out from the can. We had mac and cheese as our appetizer and it was really good. It was like on the salty side but the cheese taste stood out and it tasted really good. For Our main course we got snow crabs w/ shrimp and extra sausage. It came with one potato and corn. We picked medium spicy with garlic and butter w/ cajun sauce. This was really good too! The outside was a bit salty but it was rich in flavor in the meat. The quantity was good too. We were satisfied when we finished the whole meal.
I heard about this place for about 2 months now and finally decided to try it. I ordered the uni pasta, one pound of shrimp in the naked crab sauce, the oyster sampler, and the fish and chips appetizer. We decided to try the uni pasta because of the many pictures we saw on yelp...however the uni pasta ($28) was the biggest disappointment I've had here..the sauce was so heavy and dry that it ruined the creamy goodness that's supposed to come from the uni.. we each took a bite and didn't finish the rest.The oyster sampler ($13) however was pretty fresh and well priced..something I would come back for. The pound of shrimp($14) in the naked sauce was good but the sauce was very watery, if only it was thicker. The fish and chips ($9) appetizer was good but very small portion...
Best food I had in New York. Europe crayfish, and Japanese A5 beef are the best. Must try
Sometimes when you have a crab craving there is nothing you can do or think about until you have some decent crab. I had no interest for imitation. I wanted to have lush buttery melt in your mouth crab meat. And Naked Crab delivered with filled crab legs, butter and fun drinks (see packaging). They were friendly and accommodating and my only regret is they don't have a location closer to me.
Had a small family dinner there and let me say I was impressed! The snow crab legs were so meaty the calamari was amazing! I had the 1lb snow crab legs boil bag in Cajun sauce medium uhhh to die for! The light up drinks were everything! I def will be going back! It was surprisingly quiet for a Friday night....the DJ was great! I really enjoyed myself.
So many new dishes on the menu! Yum. We had Yohan as the server and he was outstanding as always. Please thank him for us. He was so attentive and friendly!
With a influx of cajun boils flooding this gentrified town we call Flushing, it's the new craze these days. With competition minutes away from each other, everyone is doing their best to stand out, and naked crab is doing just that, standing out. The rustic modern feel is warm with a southern comfort atmosphere of people just enjoying themselves, that it makes you just want to have a good time as well.The food is what you'd expect, nothing short of good. I must admit though, I'm not a fan of the sauces for the boils, but the quality of food and service is great. I'd say this is one of the best happy hour $1 oysters you can find. The wings are decent and the grilled oysters were good just a little small. The hero though, is that uni pasta. It's a pricey dish, but well worthy of it's praise. The pasta is nicely al dente with a nice portion of uni on top of umami bursting tomalley aka crab fat. If you don't mind the cholesterol, it's a heavenly addition with the plump pieces of uni. Overall, great food and great service, but it comes with a price. It's a new establishment that I can see lasting in this ever growing competition filled little town. Stay fat mother suckers
The store food are welcome  for kids and adults. Waiters are nice. We smell curry flavour that's  our favourite curry seafood. Oyster fresh and dipping sauce are good.   All the hall and restroom are clean and looks romanticized. Price is ok. My kid liked to eat friend fried, my mom liked to eat pasta.
First time eating here. My dad knows the owner so we were able to get a taste of mainly everything on the menu which was awesome. This is an unbiased review.We had raw oysters, baked oysters and clams (like the ones you can find in NOLA), seafood mardi gra boils, goose liver, lamb, garlic bread, steak, and dessert.I've been to NOLA this past September so the flavor profile of this place really brought me back to that trip. I'm a huge seafood boil kinda gal and this place made me extremely happy.All in all, Naked Crab gets a 10/10.Definitely will be coming back again.
If you've been to the boil in Chinatown, then you clearly know which place is the better contender. My friends and I came here since one of them had a coupon to get 1lb of shrimp for free. Of course, we go anywhere that offers some kind of free food. We ordered some cocktails, cajun fries, mac and cheese with lobster, 2lbs of clams, 1lb of shrimp (free), both with the naked sauce and medium spice, and some oysters since it was happy hour. I got the sky view cocktail which had lychee and vodka. I thought it was pretty good and my friends enjoyed their drinks as well (first kiss and in the nude). I have no say on the oysters since I'm not a big fan of them but my friends that had them said it was fresh and good. In my opinion, the stars of the dinner were the Cajun fries and the lobster mac and cheese. Why? Because I felt like the shrimp and clams were subpar. For 3 people, the shrimp and clams were more than enough. They both came with a couple of potatoes and corn which was a plus. However, the naked sauce was a disappointment. I expected something more garlicky and buttery, similar to the boil's special sauce, but it came nowhere close to it. Although there's a hint of garlic, I did wish it was stronger especially since we saw huge pieces of garlic in the bags. Though we all left pretty full, the boils itself were kind of a letdown. However, this place is a nice addition to the vast amount of restaurants in flushing. The redeeming factors of the dinner were the fries, mac and cheese, the music/ambiance, and the service we've received. It's hard to find good service in flushing so props to Naked Crab for delivering. Most likely won't be back anytime soon though.
Customer service is great . They are very friendly. When I was cold the boss even turned down the heat. Now that's what I call customer service. The shrimp is out of this world fresh and the sauce it comes in (house sauce) is the bees kneez. Way better than boil!Fresh fish. Good chefs. Good people. Good service. Good sauce. Decent atmosphere. What more could you ask for?
Love it! We went today (Sunday) for lunch. I had the white wine sangria and it was AMAZING!! Look at my photos. Self explanatory. We did the naked sauce with our lobster and prawns. We did the lemon pepper sauce with our mussels, both at a medium spicy level. We love Kumamotos and bluepoints sooooo you can best believe I ordered extras!!! Great service, great food. I can't wait to go back again.
This is one of my new favorite places! I had a blast here my first time and my second time around was still pretty enjoyable.First thing's first: Happy Hour is from 3-7PM. Past 7pm, head up to the bar for the HH deals, which is still not too shabby. Here's what you get for the HH:- $6 Cocktails (usually $8)- $5 Beers (usually $5-$9)- $1 Oysters / $1 Wings- $1.50 Grilled OystersI loved the $1 oysters, the $1 wings not so much. I just remember the meat of the wings being so red and although they look crunchy, they were pretty bland. The dollar oysters were so fresh, though! They don't give out the garlic sauce, though, just the cocktail sauce.And the drinks are pretty good - pretty strong, so you're getting your money's worth.Snow Crab Combo: Always a hit - 1 lb. snow crab with your choice of shrimp, clams, or crawfish. And I always get the shrimp. So this dish is great, but my personal peeve is that when taking the shell of the shrimp - the last tip of the tail doesn't come off - so to me it's not as fresh as I'd like it to be. But again, that's just my preference. The snow crab is still delicious, though!Lobster Roll: Personal opinion - unless I am drowning in lobster, I don't see a need for the $20 price. I did not drown in lobster, however, it comes with a ton of arugula salad and fries - doesn't equate the price tag, but it's trying.Shrimp & Avocado Salad: Honestly, this was pretty enjoyable. I wish the shrimp wasn't cut down into so many pieces, but at one point, there was definitely more avocado than lettuce, so no complaints, here!Garlic Bread: Pretty good. If this already doesn't come with the dish that I am eating, I usually order it on the side.Uni Pasta: Fish lovers who love pasta, this is for you! I didn't expect to like it as much as I did - I am not a fan of uni, but it was pleasantly enjoyable.Wild Salmon: Woot, this one was a HIT! It was cooked so well, I'm  still salivating over it...Oh! I've also had the Naked Crab Mardi Gras special. While they do say that it's a minimum of 4 people - when my group ordered it, they still asked how many people would be eating it. So we ended up ordering for two, it was still pretty filling. You get:- Snow Crab legs- Squid- Mussles- Clams- Shrimps- Corn- Potatoes- Sausage- Garlic BreadWe ordered all of this with the Naked Sauce and we didn't like the sauce...which is what the seafood was all drowned in, but I'm not holding it against this. I'd probably order this again with any other sauce.So I'm not sure for everyone else, but the only thing that bummed me out about my experiences was that because we were sitting right under the air conditioner, so if we didn't eat our food then and there, it got cold within 5 minutes. So yes, the Mardi Gras special got cold real quick.As everyone has mentioned, though, the service is awesome, so that's another reason why I'll stay loyal. Oh and the restrooms are so clean! There are 3 gender-neutral restrooms so everyone wins.And FYI for any cider lovers, the only cider they have is Rekorderlig Wild Berries Cider.Cailin's Recommendations- Snow Crab Combo ($24)- Garlic Bread ($5)- Wild Salmon ($24)- Shrimp & Avocado Salad ($8)- Uni Pasta ($28)- $1 Oysters!
Happy hour was delicious and very much worth it! The oysters were fresh and the grilled clams were great. The 1lb garlic butter clams were half off, but were a little too salty for our taste. The menu Is very straight forward and has a lot of different options, however we went for mostly sea food and were not disappointed. Service was also very good! We had a wonderful experience here and are definitely planning on coming back.
Came for HH. $1 oysters were fresh. we ordered 2 dozen in total and a dozen of $1.5 grilled oysters. When we got there at 5pm on a Sunday, it was very empty with maybe 1 or 2 tables filled. We ordered the lobster combo boil, with the naked sauce + medium spicy. It was not medium spicy as i was able to eat a lot of it (and I am the least spice tolerant person anyone knows). We had the uni pasta, which was surprisingly good. Wasn't too busy until around 6 or 7. I think their HH menu is robust and good quality.
The best crab and shrimp combo... I've ever tasted ! I mean it's easy to overspend here because everything looks good . I came here last night craving seafood with my love , and ordered the bake sea clams and for my entree the snow crab with shrimp ( garlic butter flavored) ... my taste buds were in heaven ! Not to mention the service was phenomenal.. very attentive , really nice waiters ! Highly recommend!
Although it's a seafood restaurant but I always get the shrimp avocado salad and foie gras.. it's delicious.
Food r always amazing, highly recommended!  The lamb chop; steak (30oz); Foie Gras (v good, I order this every visit); carb, and the Kobe beef (risotto lay on bottom) always delicious! Nelson always arranged the food nicely.
My favorite spot for seafood boil! Not over crowded, kid friendly, great menu, great drinks. Had to minus one star for no parking available. Best option is to park at Sky view mall's lot, 2 blocks away.  There's a good variety of dishes offered on the menu and just as delish as the boil, which is great for those that aren't down to get dirty (grilled oysters are a MUST). The food is overall well prepared and fresh (they clean out the shrimp shit!!) Definitely coming back and highly recommend!!
I've never been to any of these seafood boil places so I was really excited to try one. The naked crab was a pretty good choice in my opinion. The staff was friendly and attentive and the place was dim but not too dark. I tried their garlic pasta, which honestly just tasted like pasta with garlic sauce. Now, that being said it was still delicious. Maybe just not worth the price, which I think was about $7. The corn with butter was $3, and I thought the sauces on the corn made it good but the corn itself was a little mediocre. The clams were really good in my opinion, but just a little small. And the boil I got was the snow crab legs with shrimp. So I usually really like spicy food so I got mine with the naked sauce with is a combo of the garlic, cajun and lemon pepper and then plus the spicy flavor. I think that was a mistake on my part because the spice overpowered the seafood taste a little which I think wasn't necessary. If you like spice, getting the medium or mild is probably enough. The boil itself came with 6 crab legs, 8 shrimps, a piece of corn and half a potato. I actually really liked the potato in it, which helped with the spice lol overall, I really enjoyed my visit there, even though the pricing might not be totally worth it but I guess you're also paying for the experience, especially if you have never been!
Went here earlier this month with my bestie as I was already around flushing for a dental appointment. Been wanting to check out this place since I heard about it from my wechat feed. We came after happy hours was over (5-7pm) so missed out on the happy hour deals as we were seat on the table instead of the bar. At the bar it's all day happy hour deals. So do take advantage of that. In my tips, I mention what the happy hour deals were. Check it out. We had the boils. I had the lobster boil while my bestie had the snow crab boil. When you first add them on your wechat acct if you have wechat which I recommend. It's my favorite chat/social media platform. Most popular in China as it was develop there. Anyways, after you add their acct on your wechat friends and post up three photos on your wechat feed, they will give you one pound of shrimp free. So worth it! Checking into yelp will get you a free glass of wine. Worth it. Now back to the boil. It was well season sauce and delicious. This is definitely a place for seafood lovers. If you want crayfish they are out for the season. But there is a seafood place in 8th avenue that offer crayfish boil. Very good place for crayfish called "Beef and Fish".  But if you are craving boils and don't feel like going all the way to queens, then check out "Boat house" in 8th Ave Brooklyn.  Back to Naked crab, the staff was professional and friendly. Service was acceptable. Would come back again for the happy hour specials. I noticed they have a competitor restaurant call "shaking crab" down the block that also offer boils in flushing. I will check out that place next and let you know my review.
Went here recently & although the restaurant is just about identical to "Claw Daddy's" the food is slightly better. We had the grilled oysters, chicken wings & fried oysters (you haven't lived until you had fried oysters ) for our appetizers. As our entree my friend had the shrimp boil & I had shrimp/crawfish which was really good. The drinks were really good as well & 100% better than Claw Daddy's.
we were originally going to Shaking Crab but good thign we didnt! we saw Naked Crab on yelp and decided to switch last minute. We made it just in time for dinner but early enough for the HH specials! lucky us! - HH even on weekends until 7pm! the HH although is limited, is enough - $5 beer and wine, and $1 raw oysters, $1.50 grilled oysters, $1 per wing - we ordered a little bit of everything. Don't expect anything premium here, but it fills the crave for some raw/cooked oysters. The seating was spacious and it wasn't too crowded the entire time we dined here. The servers did get busy and it was hard to flag one down but the meal was great. We ordered a lb of the Shabang sauce which had a weird kick of sriracha in the beginning but ur palette adjusts and you start to like it quite a bit. their garlic butter sauce can use a bit of work but nonetheless, satisfies the craving for some seafood. Little did we know, they have a few, and by a few i mean 2-3 spots in the front of the restaurant for parking. There's only one ramp so you may have to roll up on the curb. Their men is quite extensive and I ordered a side of white rice - expecting nice asian jasmine rice and what i got instead was some cheap american rice... either that or it was extremely low quality rice. I was disappointed because I always eat the rice with the sauce in the seafood bags. My friend ordered a lobster roll - and found a nice piece of human hair tucked into the roll - needless to say she didn't eat it and they took it off the bill. I was also disappointed they didn't have gumbo. But still had a great meal.
I've been here twice. Very clean restaurant and good service both times. First time I tried the Uni Pasta and a pound of shrimp in their homemade sauce. The second time, I tried the garlic butter noodles, lobster roll, and another pound of shrimp in garlic butter sauce. I would say that everything was above satisfactory except for the lobster roll. The bun they use feels very ordinary - almost like a regular hot dog bun. The lobster bits are made into a cole slaw like mixture, which doesn't give it the typical lobster roll flavor. The uni pasta is $28 which is very expensive for what you get, but the presentation is A1. They often have groupons available for use. I'm looking forward to returning for their happy hour!
My family and I were in the mood for seafood and we happened upon this place. The hostess and the waitresses were very friendly aside from the one waiter who seemed rather annoyed. They had the music blaring like it was a night club scene so when we had to constantly repeat our orders, he was visibly annoyed. The Lobster Combo ($40) was lacking in terms of quantity while the flavor was decent; half an ear of corn and half a potato with a small lobster was certainly not worth the money. We never even received the salmon dish since they ended up sending it to another table. One time for this place is enough. Not worth the money or the time. You're practically yelling to everyone since they refused to turn the music down. There's no wait because this place isn't even worth the time to walk to it. There are plenty of other places in Flushing that have good seafood at a good price and you can actually have a private conversation. Please don't even give this place a second thought.
This place is a hidden gem. The food is amazing. The boil sauces are wonderful and at a reasonable price. My favorite dish is the truffle pasta, baked clams and the truffle oil lamb chops. Definitely a must try. Oh the coconut pudding is amazing too. I highly recommend this place.
First time eating there. Took our 9yr old for her bday dinner. We had the seafood boils with lobster, snow crab legs and shrimp. The garlic butter sauce is delicious. My husband and I really like the cocktails the was serve in ziplock bags with light up ices. Definitely try the sky view it's amazing. We would definitely come back again and try the other items in the menu. Also the service was friendly and efficient.
I saw a good deal for this spot on Groupon. I'm not sure if the deal is still available but go check it out. I recommend a few dishes here:Wild Salmon: did not have the fishy taste which was great, the chef cooked it to near perfectionGarlic noodles: worth trying Cajun corn: too much white sauce for me but the flavor combo was a worthy tryCreme brule: Super good, must try dessert, the original flavor is YUM!Thai Iced Tea: Flavor was on point, ask for more milk if you like it milkyI somewhat recommend the beef sliders: too much coleslaw, if you like coleslaw then you would like this burger. The beef patty taste was alright nothing to rave about.
Came in on Saturday at 7:30pm with a serious cajun boil craving. If you're driving, theres about 5 parking spots right in front of the restaurant. Instant Pros: 1. No wait to be seated 2. Happy hour EVERY DAY raw oysters ($1),  grilled clams and oysters ($1.50)We started with the raw oysters and clams which tasted very fresh. The clams were huge! 4/5. Next we had a few grilled oysters and clams which were a mouthful of hot salty cheesy goodness 4/5. The garlic noodles were like spaghetti noodles with a sweet sauce and salty cheese on top.  It was alright, 3/5. Now for the main event. For the 2 of us,  we decided on 1 lb crawfish ($14/lb) in cajun sauce, 1 lb crawfish in naked sauce and 1 lb King crab legs ($38/lb) in naked sauce. Each bag came with a piece of corn and a potato. I think it must be crawfish season because these crawfish were big and meaty. The king crab was cooked perfectly and retained its ocean sweetness. The cajun sauce had a sweetness to it and reminded me of Japanese curry. The Naked sauce, which is a mix of cajun,  lemon butter,  and garlic butter was a little better,  but personally still not enough garlic. Overall taste experience 4/5, and this mostly because I can't help but compare the taste to The Boil which has the sauce that's jam packed with garlic.  The bartender was very friendly. The service was excellent.  The Boil has a special place in my heart and stomach, but the Naked Crab is a contender when I can't wait 50 min to get to Chinatown. I would definitely come back.
I've been to many seafood places in the city and in Flushing. Never had anything really stand out but no complaints. That said, Naked Crab is great! Came here twice so far and both times the service was great. The prices are reasonable (1 lb of snow crab + shrimp for $24 includes corn and potatoes) and even greater if you get the Groupon! The waitresses will check up on you often and refill your water often as well. The seafood is really fresh and you can taste it. When I crack open a crack leg, there's a satisfying whole piece of meat instead of having it broken in half. Got my food to go cus I couldn't finish it all. When I got home and wanted to eat it, I saw that they included a pair of plastic gloves to eat it with. So thoughtful and sweet!Would def come here again :)!
Came here for the happy hour and left happy. Highly recommend the grilled oysters/clams.
I've been to Boiling Crab on the West Coast many times so I'm always looking for something similar here in NY. This place came up and I decided to give it a try. Servers were very friendly and always available when needed. They have Happy Hour from 3-7 which is always a plus in my book. Oysters are $1 each which was pretty fresh, we ended up ordering more, Grilled oyster I think it's $1.50 each was also pretty good but I prefer raw. We then ordered 1lb of Cajun shrimp, 1lb of sheabang shrimp, 1 butter garlic sauce lobster, 2 lbs of the naked sauce snow crab. Portions were huge well worth it! The sauces not so much a fan it was very thick and it tasted ok. Also ordered Foie Gras amazing! And creme brulee heaven!. I would Definitely come back here and just order steamed without any sauce.
My girlfriend and I found a Groupon for The Naked Crab ($15 for $30 worth) so we decided to give it a try. We made reservations for a Saturday at 6PM 3-4 days in advance. Little did we know, there was a blizzard on that day that made traveling by car very difficult and dangerous. Being the adventurous couple that we are, some might say "stupid", we decided to still go. They have a "parking lot" that could hold up to 4 cars max right in front of their restaurant. So being the lucky guy that I am, I was able to snag myself a spot right next to the only car there. We were greeted right when we walked in and we even got to choose where we sat because there was a grand total of 2 other groups of customers. The service was awesome because all the attention was focused on us, basically. Our water and tea cups were constantly being refilled, mostly my girlfriend's because she seems to always be suffering from dehydration or something. The highlight of my visit though was when I was having trouble rolling up my sleeves because I had sauce all over my gloves. The waiter came over and offered to roll up my sleeves. What a guy, right? I made sure to leave a generous tip for this fellow. The restaurant started filling up a little towards the end of our dinner, so that just shows we're not the only adventurous people willing to sacrifice our safety for some seafood.
Stop in Naked Crab let me tell you this place is very good the service and food was excellent too bad I live in CA.  Next time I am in town will come back for the mushroom risotto Kobe beef that was my favorite  there was a bunch of other good food but this Kobe beef was the one that stood out the most
Have a wonderful experience at Naked Crab, love the food and special the lobster sandwich.  Affordable price for happy hours.  Will come back again.
The Uni pasta is well cooked and delicious; Crawfish is a bit on the small side but the spices are superb.  Overall a good place to go.
Dined in with familyEnvironment was very night club feel with good vibesFood raw - Raw was absolutely amazing over tons of ice and is very fresh  broil - the seasoning is amazing which makes the broil, spices might be spicy for otherssliders/steak - believe it over not the steak was the most random thing on the menu but the presentation and how they cook it 10/10sliders came in three varies a must tryoverall a great place to pregame or hang out with friends*great cocktails
Definitely isn't my first choice for seafood but it's local and their seasoning is delicious .. drinks are good (could be stronger), they come in a cute pouch with a light up ice cube. My only disappointment was my crab legs had little to no meat inside
I order the lobster roll and it was okay. Was expecting it to be phenomenal but it wasn't.   The fries and salad was good.  Doubt I'll go back
This place is awesome. Their Kumamoto oysters are so fresh. Their boils are delicious. I live a couple of blocks away from here- this is going to be my go to spot for seafood. I'm super happy I found this gem in the heart of Flushing!
Seafood are fresh. Staffs are friendly. The only downside is the sauce is little too spicy when we ordered mild. It's more like moderate spicy than mild when we received the food. Overall, would recommend this place for decent seafood.
Great place! Loved the decor, the people and drinks. The appetizer garlic noodles wasn't what we expected! They used over cooked spaghetti noodles. It was alright. Won't order again. We also ordered the calamari which came with a sweet sauce. Again Won't order again. We ordered the special for $35 person...included potatoes, corn, blue crab, sausage, mussels, clams and Shrimps. We ordered for two and it was enough for four. The Cajun sauce with garlic was good but we chose medium hot and it was too hot for some of us. We also ordered a king crab boil with the same sauce but hot. It was way too hot so next time I'll get medium! Loved that they gave each of us gloves which helped us to keep our hands clean and not smelling like seafood. The mixed drink choices were interesting. We will definitely stoping in again
My favorite seafood restaurant the fried calamari with the mango chili sauce it comes with is to die for, and I love the lobster roll the drinks are delicious the hunger games drink "khaleesi" is my fav
Truly amazing place in Flushing! Didn't have much expectations before I went as I thought it was another gimmick restaurant, glad it proved me wrong!  We were a party of 10 and went on a Sunday night. The restaurant is not packed but did fill about 80% of the tables. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant and still feel pretty comfortable and not too noisy. The food is tasty! The duck confit salad, baked clams/oysters, black truffle pasta and the bags of various seafood. Oh almost forgot the crawfish - I can't  handle spicy food too well and the restaurant was able to tone down on the spicy and made it perfect for me. The desserts are amazing! The coconut pudding is excellent and the green tea tiramisu is perfect. But more importantly, the staffs there made the experience even better. The host Nelson is a very nice guy, he's very accommodating with my toddler special request (very kids friendly place), made honest recommendations for food. Overall cleanliness is so good that is rare to see in Flushing. Other waiters were very attentive to our needs and always made sure we have clean plates to use and took away our emptied shells. Decor is just right and made us very comfortably seated and enjoyed our food. I definitely will go back again - even if it means I need to deal with the crazy Flushing traffic!
Purchased a coupon for this place and ordered a bunch of appetizers to share. Service was fantastic, interior had a fun vibe but the food could have been better.- Calamari: was rubbery, dipping sauce was good but I wish they gave more.- Lobster Mac and Cheese: was a bit watery and bland.- Fish and Chips: the fish they used had a VERY strong fishy flavor, not sure if it was fresh or if it was just the type of fish used but it wasn't very good. The tarter sauce that was included for dipping was salty. The fries were perfect.If I go back I'll try their signature boils next time but definitely avoiding the appetizers.
Doesn't get better and fresher than this. I was craving cajun food the other day and didn't find anything local. My boyfriend had found this place through a yelp search and thought why not try it. It's not southern food, but that cajun seasoning on my awesome snow crab boil was insane! Took me back to New Orleans.The atmosphere is pretty calm; I like the set up. All the tools you need for the crab are already on the table. They have their specials written on the wall. The oysters are great. So many choices!I have no complaints at all with this place, I've been three times in the past month, must get back soon!
Love love love this spot. Although The Boil will always have my heart, Naked Crab has become my go-to seafood spot. I've been here more than four times since its opening and have no regrets.They have a great selection of sauces to choose from for their boils, and my personal favorite is the shebang sauce, medium spicy. Their shrimps are always fresh from my experience, so just go with that if you're not sure what to order for your first time.Also, do yourself a favor and take advantage of their Happy Hour specials (applies for any time of the day if you're sitting at the bar). Oysters are $1 and their cocktails ($6) are delicious! If you're into fruity cocktails like me, I recommend the First Love or Red Wedding. You won't regret it.Oh, and I couldn't end the review without mentioning how friendly the owner is. If you've been to Naked Crab, you probably know who I'm talking about because he's always super attentive and welcoming to the customers.
My friend did her birthday there and our bill came out to $500. The price is cheap for a sea food place but the only downside is the taste.. it doesn't taste good. The soft shell crab burger is tasteless and the calamari tasted bread crumbs only. Need more seasoning.
The best seafood in queens.. has amazing inventive style drinks ... knowledgeable staff .... perfectly cooked food def a go to place for seafood and def a place I will be back to many times more
We went at happy hour time on a Saturday. Yes they have happy hour on Saturdays too! The cocktails all tasted good with a good amount of alcohol . I ordered skyview and sweet temptation both very good. We had clams, oysters, crabs, garlic bread, uni pasta, shrimp avacado salad all was good except for shrimp avacado salad was a bit small and very little shrimp and avacado. Music was good as if I'm listening to my own playlist in my car lol.
The naked crab wasn't as bad as I expected. I came in here with low expectations due to all the previous reviews but I had a decent dinner. I enjoyed the happy hour mainly because of the drinks. I didn't order the raw oyster but I did get the wings, grilled clam and grilled oyster. TBH I didn't really like it... the sauce and garlic on top was an okay flavor but boyyyyy was it fishy. I did enjoy the fried chicken wings..I've never had anything like it. Super crunchy. The cajun fries were also pretty good. We ordered mac n cheese..which looked like it came from a kraft box...The boil was pretty good, a lot of crab legs were in it but I would suggest putting some veggies and potatoes. The scissors on the table and the roll of paper towel were super helpful.
Disappointed Valentine's Day dinner. Hubby made RSVP to the restaurant after looking at the good reviews. Restaurant was half full by the time we got there and was seated right away. We settled in and got our drinks quickly, but we had to flag down the waitress to order. After sitting and starving for 25 minutes, we tried to flag down the waitress and asked where our food is. She said "oh! we are very busy today, your food should be coming out soon." Ok, so then we got the calamari followed by the grilled corn, Uni pasta, and snow crab & shrimp boil in medium spicy Naked sauce. Calamari was on point! The best part of the meal. the breading was crispy and not oily, and the squid was tender. The sauce dip was a sweet mango mixture but the serving was so sparse - even the second we asked for.Grilled Corn - meh, I've had better. It's got a good amount of mayo, cheese, but maybe lacking in salt?Uni Pasta - only ordered this because my hubby wanted to try fresh Uni and the glowing reviews of the pasta from Yelp users. The pasta was great, and the Uni very fresh. It also came with a green paste on top that kind of turned me away. But my hubby said it was ok.The Boil - I have to say that I was disappointed with the boil. I've had some back in Las Vegas and it was the bomb. This place did not live up to that first taste. We had the medium spicy Naked sauce, but it was really spicy with a jalapeno type spice. I was expecting more of a galic-y spice. It came with potatoes and corn - which was not mentioned in the menu and thus the reason why we ordered the grilled corn and we were left with so much corn after this.Soda - beware, the soda is like a 6oz glass bottle size for $3. Not worth it.Then getting the check, omg, we just wanted to run already...there was only about 2-3 waitresses serving the now packed restaurant - about 80 people. I flagged down the hostess and told her we have a groupon and want the check. She said we can't use it. I told her we told the waitress before said to do it at the end. The hostess said, "oh" and left and never came back. We flagged down another lady - probably a server - who told us to wait for our waitress. We finally flagged down our waitress and it took another 10 minutes to settle our bill. The table next to us got their food (and they ordered a ton of food) and was out way before us!!!! The owner/manager - whoever wrote about how great he is....never saw him. I am disappointed in the lack of servers on a holiday.Will I go back? I'll never say never, but I don't think I will crave this joint anytime soon.Oh, and there is a couple of parking spots out in front of the restaurant. Call ahead and ask if there are spots. Otherwise, you can pay to park at Skyview Mall across the street.
First time here and it was a beautiful experience. I went with a $30 off Groupon last Sunday accompanied by a friend and didn't know what to expect. Our server Jasmine helped us with the drink choices and food as well. She kept checking on us to make sure we were comfortable. We had the Cajun wings and fries for appetizers. For the entree, I had the lobster and clam combo (Cajun spicy) and my friend had 2 orders of king crab legs and a lb of shrimp. Both orders came with 1/4 corn on the cob and a potato. I love the Cajun spice used for the combos. It wasn't too spicy or too salty. It was just right for my taste buds and I would definitely return again with or without a Groupon.
Was seated at a table right away, waitress was friendly and polite. When it came to the food, it's wasn't what I expected. Mussels tasted as if they just caught it, had the gritty taste of sand. The crabs didn't have any flavor. Only thing that actually tasted great was the chicken wings! Even their drinks .
I really enjoyed the food here...until I found a golf ball sized spider in the crawfish boil. The owners were extremely apologetic and even comped our entire meal. They were very professional and assured us they would educate their staff to be more careful when cleaning the crawfish. This was a birthday lunch for me from my mom so they even brought out a complimentary creme brulee (which was delicious) with a giant flaming candle. Onto the food. EVERYTHING was amazing. We ordered the happy hour $1 raw oysters, grilled oysters, and wings. We also got the uni pasta, 2lbs of snow crab, and 1lb of crawfish. That uni pasta though. Oh em gee. I've been dreaming about it ever since. It was perfectly al dente with large, fresh pieces of uni, and topped off with this crab egg heaven. Droooool! The crawfish was surprisingly fresh too. Not overcooked and super juicy. Unfortunately, I only ate 3 before the spidey. The crab legs were a good meaty size too. We weren't really crazy about the sauces, but I'm not a big fan of Cajun seasoning, and everything is smothered in it for the boils no matter which sauce you choose. It's premade so you can't request it without. The atmosphere is modern and fun. I'll definitely be back for that uni pasta!
this place is good like american style table and bar stuff and was ok but not thats fresh as i though i order lobster doesnt taste so great for me like they use dead lobster but service is great keep going
Came here for an event. The fare was mainly fried things - calamari, fries, shrimp balls, fish, etc. There was also salad and some base drinks like OJ. Overall, I liked the feel of the place - the wood is a nice touch - and the decor is interesting. The food was pretty tasty as well, my favourite being the shrimp balls with cheddar.
Latest in Cajun style seafood in Queens.  The combos are a good deal with Alaskan crab, shrimp with head on, Potatoes and corn inclined.  Lemon pepper and garlic butter sauces and the spicy level  could be varied.Garlic bread was good. The Brussels sprouts were tasty with the fatty bacon. Offered non seafood items like sliders, chicken wings and burger.  This is helpful for any non seafood lovers in the group.  Casual booths and tables, also bar with flat screens, and loud music. Drafty whenever someone enters from the main door.
It was just ok.  Good service, not good food.  $8 for a 1/2 glass of red wine, poured in a white wine glass.  My wine drinkers know what I'm saying...wouldn't go back.  The Boil is where I'm at!
Amazing experience! I came here with a friend at 4pm right when they opened on a Monday. I love the interior of the restaurant; very spacious and inviting. There is also a nice bar in the restaurant. I didn't catch the bartenders name, but she was so so so nice and helpful. We sat at the bar because we wanted to take advantage of the $1 wings and $6 drinks. For the drinks, we got the Red Wedding and the Red Sangria. The food was amazing, and super fresh. For the appetizers, we ordered (and will recommend) the mac and cheese with lobster ($6 extra) and the calamari (the sauce it came with was a sweet and sour sauce and it pairs perfectly) We then ordered the pound of shrimp and crabs with the Naked sauce which was recommended to us (a blend of all the sauces together) We definitely enjoyed the shrimp and the crabs..they were delish and plus we love seafood! It also came with a big piece of potato and a little piece of corn. (You can also order extra) This place is comparable to The Boil, but the customer service was so on point that I recommend this place to everyone!
I LOVED This place. I came two nights in a row for Happy Hour. Who doesn't love dollar blue point oysters. The service was great and the menu was even better. I had the mac & cheese which was amazing....along with the Romanesco Cauliflower. The next night I had the crab boil. It was very good just missing some crusty bread to get all that good sauce!
A flushing gem. As we entered with a party of five on a Wednesday night, the environment was warm and the waiters and waitresses were very welcoming. We got fresh oysters and clams, fish and chips, and fried calamari to start, and the snow crab combo with shrimp covered in the "naked special sauce." The naked sauce is a must! It basically consisted of Cajun, garlic butter, and lemon pepper and it was to die for! The oysters were extremely fresh and the fish & chips were crispy and melts in your mouth. Considering this place is similar to The Boil in Chinatown, it's convenient to open one like it in flushing. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family. However, this place is currently cash only just like a lot of places in flushing but there's a chase atm down the block. So come prepared!
Service is always on point, especially ask for phyllis, super sweet girl. The bartender Dora makes the best drinks, you can ask for extra strong and she can still make it taste so good it just creeps up.
Tasty spicy delicious, staff is great very attentive and friendly
Decent seafood place among the likes of Boiling Crab, O Crab, The Boil, etc. Even though we ordered two boils, the best dish (by far) was surprisingly the duck salad, consisting of arugula with light dressing, and several slices of really tender, flavorful duck. It was a hard dish to follow, but even so the boils were much more underwhelming. We got the Dungeness crab with crayfish and the lobster with clams with medium spice, and it was nice but nothing crazy good.
Came here with my family, everything we wanted to try apparently was sold out the day before. They have the happy Hour menu on the wall...only to find nothing was available. We ended up just ordering Boil seafood. The Cajun sauce was just way too salty, the pepper lemon was spicy...the only good one was pretty Gaelic butter sauce....I also ordered the strawberry mint lemonade and that was BIG Disappointment. DO NOt ORDER it, it was the worse drink I had tried in my life, I had about 2 sips and left the whole drink there, it gave me a HUGE headache afterwards. At the end of the night, my husband and I ended up in the bathroom...don't think we will ever come back. I would suggest going to Claw Daddy's in the city, the food is WAY better.
Came to eat here with a friend on afternoon. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere. There was one one other occupied table when we sat down to eat. We ordered the cajun boils and they were not tasty. The sauce just kind of sits out side of the seafood, leaving the seafood tasteless. The sauce mix needs some adjustments! You can see the oil and sauce separating, it does not have an appetizing appeal. The waiter failed to tell us our groupon can't be used if we ordered anything off the happy hour menu. So I just had my groupon expire because I do not plan on eating here again. For oyster lovers, they do have $1 oysters during happy hour!
Dirty practises, dirty management and dirty food. They have a mandatory 18% tip charge which is an oxymoron. The management obviously is pocketing the cash and not reporting the taxes but most importantly, the sand in the food was extreme tonight. Was good place before, lost it's touch, they just don't care anymore.
Second time here enjoying happy hour, cocktails, fried calamari, $1 Bluepoint oysters, grill oysters and clams,  everything so good. The environment,  music it all makes it comfortable. Parking is the only problem.
Made a reservation for 5 people without a problem. Appetizers are okay and service is friendly. HOWEVER, they ran out of snow crab legs!!! How does a seafood place that specializes in boil-type seafood run out of snow crab?!?! Had to go with the king crab instead - wasn't very good and much more expensive. Might give it another try since they have uni pasta that i'm intrigued by, but seriously disappointing first time.
Overall the seafood is fresh but pricy. Avoid all kinds of  sashimi. We had a lobster sashimi and an abalone sashimi. Both are in a small portion. I can finish the abalone with just one bite. The Cajun seafood is much better. The price is reasonable. The service is also very good. Next time, I will only order the Cajun seafood.
The ambience is a cool, fun chill vibe. The prices are very reasonable. I ordered a snow crab boil...which I was apprehensive about because snow crab legs are usually very lackluster. However I was pleasantly surprised with how satisfied I was with my choice. I had more than enough crab legs in the bag (I barely finished them). The cocktails were every good as well. And the wait staff was professional as well.
Fresh seafood and great service! Definitely a place to visit if you want some seafood!!
Great selection of food even if you aren't planning to eat seafood. You can get down and dirty with the gloves and bibs to crack open your crab legs or peel your shrimp OR you can have a nice dainty meal of pasta or steak. it was cool to see a mix of both in the same restaurant. 6 of us girls ordered 9lbs of seafood broil in total. We had 3lbs of snow crab legs, 3lbs of shrimp, 2 lbs of clams, and 1 lb of mussels. We did try the cajun sauce and the lemon pepper but the two didn't taste really different. The medium spicy isn't spicy at all so if you go higher if you'd like. The seafood was great overall and I'l be bringing friends/parents back! The only thing that annoyed us a bit was the music that was a bit too loud. With a full house and so many people talking, it was already hard to hear each other and the music didn't help.
Best boil in Queens. The Koleesi drink was very nice. On the sweet side but light and fruity. I had the grilled clam appetizer and the lobster and shrimp boil in medium naked sauce. The medium was just hot enough to make your nose run so if you like a little spice don't go any further then this. The clams were a. It salty I believe it was the cheese on top but they were still very tasty. The naked sauce was very tasty and not too oily. The seafood taste fresh not frozen. It's also very conveniently located ext to a lot of transportation
The food and drinks were absolutely the best. I would definitely recommend this place.
This place is really good one of my favorite places to eat pasta.Amazing! I will visit again next time I'm in the flushing .
I came for the oyster happy hour though I eventually got suckered in to try a few things. The raw oysters were pretty good but lacked variety. Some were shucked a bit poorly and had a lot of shell and grit which was unpleasant. The grilled oysters I did not like as much and were also more expensive. The garlic they used wasn't cooked enough so there was a heavy flavor with a hint of sourness. The uni pasta was far better than I anticipated with a robust richness and well cooked pasta. The boil however I thought was weak. The flavors did not steep into the seafood and it was almost bland. I would not recommend this.
Love this place!great  service , tasty drinks, this restaurant  not only have boils but aslo they have very good entrees 。like rack of lamb, steak, squik ink pasta  and grilled  lobster  with cheese  on it, all taste delicious. For the boil garlic  butter and shabang are my favorite  flavors, cant wait to try more stuff!
Came here the first time cause of all the positive reviews. The grill oysters for happy hr was really good. But that's about it. My bf and I got 2 lbs shrimp and 1 lb snow crab with the naked sauce. The naked sauce in my opinion isn't as good the boil sauce. If the sauces were rated on the scale of 1-10; the boil being 10 then naked crab is 3 The snow crab was unusually tough. I've been to similar locations and none of them were like this. Something was definitely wrong with the snow crab. I will not be back.
Second time weve been here. First time was actually a good visit, im reviewing for the second one. Walked in with my girlfriend, theres very few people in the restaurant for late dinner. Took us about 5-10 mins to order upon sitting down due to deciding if i should get crawfish on the snow crab combo or shrimp, thought id try to crawfish. Also ordered a pound of shrimp and a side of cajun fries and rice bowl.  Placed our order now the waiting game begins. A big group of people came in and a couple of guests on different parties, a couple sat down at the bar as well and some guests on tables have left. We were served cajun fries, the only reason i gave the review one extra star. Eventually while eating and finishing the fries while waiting for our seafood, we notice most of the tables that have sat down after us are getting their orders one by one including the big party. Clearly our order was de-prioritized. We waited on...its been 35 minutes. I told my girlfirend i wanted to leave but she said give it 5 more minutes. Luckily(or not) the food came 3 minutes later. Ive almost lost my appetite but might as well since we were there. We ordered cajun mild on both the shrimp and the snow crab combo. Shrimp sauce was ok, shrimp seemed overcooked where its shells were hard to separate from the meat. On the snowcrab combo, the sauce had a good cajun kick to it but very salty let alone the crabmeat itself was salty as well. We also ordered a rice bowl and this was either last night rice or someone dont know how to cook rice because it was very hard and dry. Not the even a mediocre dinner unfortunately since we had a good first visit and mostly ruined by the almost 40 minute wait. I doubt ill be back in this location since Hot n Juicy crawfish is opening up soon around the neighborhood.
Very similar to the boil in Chinatown. Convenient for people in flushing to go too. I ordered raw oysters which was a little small for blue point, wings was pretty good, uni pasta, and a seafood platter Cajun flavor which both were good
A group of guys went here on a Saturday afternoon for some fresh raw oysters as well as other samplings.  We got there and it was happy hour so the blue points were $1 each!   We also got the grilled clams and individual entrees.The food was fresh, the entree sizes were a bit on the small size, but none of the guys complained.  I had the lobster roll and was pleasantly surprised it wasn't made with mayo!  It was fresh and tasty!I found a new spot close to my church whenever I am in need of oysters!
We chose this restaurant to be our company thanksgiving party place. We arrived at around 6:40pm and we ordered like 3 runs raw/grilled oysters, clams, chicken wings for happy hour price, which is really cheap and food tastes good as well. especially the grilled oyster. We also ordered lobster combo with shrimps and corns on the side. I chose naked crab sauce I think other sauce will be better. Their mushroom cream soup is soso. Recommend to sit at the bar so you can enjoy the happy hour all night!
I had the cajun fries, snow crab and shrimp with the naked sauce which is anything but naked. Its a combination of the garlic butter, lemon pepper and something else. It was a little over whelming for seafood. Next time I'll stick to something simpler. The snow crab was very good and sweet. The shrimp was ok but pretty big in size. Each seafood bag comes with corn and potato. They do have happy hour special and available even on holidays. So glad I was able to try it.
Place is welcoming and industrial in design. My party ordered Brussels sprouts, snow crab legs Mac and cheese with lobster and clams. I didn't like the clams much too fishy for my taste,but my friend loved them. I loved everything else. We both had Shabang sauce in our crab leg shrimp combo,which consist of lemon butter cilantro and siracha. Now we a full content and no longer Hangry!
Not too bad for a place in Flushing.  The happy hour specials were worth the price.  The baked clams were really good. If you check in with yelp you get wine.  We ordered some of the boil stuff.  The shrimp is good.  The clams was not worth it because the shell is adding mostly to the weight.  Uni pasta and garlic pasta is just ok.  Overall experience is not bad.  Things are pretty good.
Ordered food from here off of UberEats. After discovering they sold lobster rolls, we prolonged our hunger and waited until they opened. Ordered a lobster roll, shrimp and avocado salad, cajun wings and cajun fries. It took a nice amount of time to come but the order was correct when it finally arrived. Everything was delicious, although the lobster roll was quite small and I was happy I had ordered a salad as well so I wouldn't be hungry afterwards. I think for $17 the lobster roll could be a tad bit bigger and come with a few more fries.
Happy hour is totally worth it. The oysters were fresh and the grilled oysters and clams were great. The chicken wings were crispy and were fried in a nice batter. Also had the uni pasta which was ok, a little overpriced considering the area and didn't come out hot but not bad. Didn't try the boil but people who had it seemed to enjoy it. Will try that next time.
NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN. I had a really bad stomachache that very same night after dinner and I started vomiting. Well oh well, turns out I had food poisoning. I knew I had to stop eating after I ate a few pieces of oysters and it wasn't fresh. Maybe it was the oysters or shrimp. Who knows but I am never coming back again.
Biggest waste of time and money. It was pretty priced up for the quality of the food. I would have no problem paying for it if I had enjoyed my meal but this was one of the worst attempt at southern food I have ever seen. The seafood while seems fresh, still had a stanky sea water smell to it, absolutely disgusting. The squid ink pasta.... horrible. The coveted boiled seafood was decent but nothing to write home about. If you want better food, go to the boil.After leaving, believe it or not, we went to another place to get more food. This was entirely because the quality of the food was so subpar that we did not want to order more food. Closing remarks,Avoid if possible.
It is really so-so! We were there for the happy hours. We (2 adult and 1 kid) ordered a dozen raw oysters, 2 dozen grilled oysters , chicken wings and 2 cocktails. The raw oyster is so small! I am a petit, usually a dozen raw oyster will make me full, but not at here! The grilled oysters for my husband are also very small! The chicken wings is nothing special! And the cocktails are like juice! We spent around 100 dollars there, but nobody is full or feel satisfied......we have to go to another restaurant .......so don't recommend this place!
this perfect resturant to have dinner with friends and family very differens with other s.
I am eating now, can't wait to give a review. It is an amazing seafood restaurants. They put food in the bag. You can use your hand to catch what you want. I have been search such restaurant for a long time. Finally, I find If they have more selections, I will definitely come here every week.
Definitely going back in the future.  Parked at sky-view mall parking, then walk through the mall. I went close to closing time on a weekday, so it wasn't very busy.  The waiting staff were nice and attentive. Loved the Mac and Cheese with lobster.  Must walk up for their happy hour one day.
Tasty food but way overpriced for small portions. The waiter was excellent and I liked the atmosphere. We ordered the lobsters & shrimp combo boil with garlic butter sauce and added a pound of snow crab . Excellent sauce with  great flavor , also had the squid ink pasta which was ok nothing special . The grilled oysters were very tasty as our appetizer. I walked out still hungry for what I paid . I might go back for the happy hour specials .
An absolutely great experience and service! Not only that but the food is beyond amazing! Chicken Wings were perfect along with the calamaris and to top it off the seafood boils were PERFECT!!! The seasoning was finger licking good!I will definitely be back and recommend Naked Crab to anyone looking for a different experience to dine.Make sure you order their cocktails! Especially their "In The Nude" cocktail, Dora does an amazing job making them.
After a failed attempt to enjoy festivities at the Long Island Oyster Festival, my family and I Yelped this location and decided to check it out. We came on Saturday around 3PM for a party of six, we stayed for about 3 hours and there was only one other table the entire time.- 3 Dozen Raw Oysters for Happy Hours ($1 each) - Fresh, great price and quality, would definitely order this again. Don't forget to ask for horseradish if you're into it.- 1 Dozen Grilled Oysters for Happy Hours ($1.50 each) - Great price, nothing compared to New Orleans, but I would definitely order this again. It is great if you like butter, garlic and parmesan cheese.- 6 Fried Cajun Chicken Wings for Happy Hour ($1 each) - Decent price and size though I did not really taste the Cajun. Liked the batter though.- 1 Uni Pasta ($28) - Loved it, wouldn't really order it again for that price but worth the try - 2 Foie Gras ($20) - Delicious, would order this again - 2 lbs Seafood Boil (Shrimp & Clams) - Seasoning was on point, wouldn't normally order this in a restaurant though but if you're into this its definitely worth the try!- 1 Branzino ($24) - Great crisp on the skin, a little expensive for the protion imo- 1 Avocado Shrimp Salad ($8) - The apple vinaigrette was delicious!  I'd order this again because of it. - Creme brulee - Cute presentation, haven't seen creme brulee presented that way before. Probably because the burnt surface area (which is the best part) is less than the total custard. Good flavor though.Service was great, but again we were 1 out of 2 tables for about 3 hours.  I'm surprised to see a place like this in Flushing. Though the parking is rough, I'd definitely return since The Boil is a little inconvenient to get to. If you're looking to save your wallet I do not recommend this place. If you're used to city prices and can't make it out to The Boil this is a great place to go to. Don't forget to bring cash (10% off).
Great food and great service! Like the lamb chop and coconut pudding. Came in with 7 people and the owner Nelson kept us entertained all the time.
This place has a great happy hour so get there early to enjoy it.  I particular like drink  "In the nude" it was delicious.  The appetizers were so good you almost don't need to order entrees.  I said almost!  Jasmine our waitress was awesome.  Great to talk to and crack jokes with.  I would definitely go back.
The place is soso, the food is not that good. We ordered Cajun wings; but they gave us all drumsticks. I don't know if they did that intentionally because we use a Groupon voucher? The table next to us got the wings. Also the drumsticks are over fried; hard like a rock. Very very disappointing experience. Will not return again!!!
Ambiance: Good music, very relaxed environment. The tables are clean and the decor is cute.Service: 10/10- attentive staff, the wait was not long at all.I had two drinks: the sky blue cocktail and a lime mojito. The sky blue cocktail was really good- it tastes just like a lychee drink with a hint of vodka. I had the oysters, clams, avocado/shrimp salad, duck liver, crab legs, squid, etc. all of the seafood was fresh and tasty. The sauces provided were also flavorful. Everything was filling- the meat was crispy and tender as well. Overall it was a great experience. My stomach was very happy :^)
This place is nice and the food was not bad. Their garlic noodle is good. Their garlic bread is also good. However,their butter and garlic sauce in the combos don't really taste like butter and garlic. Their cocktails are ok. The raw tower is very fresh!
Food and staff were great!! Will definitely come back for more... in fact, maybe today! Lol. Also, this place reminds me of Claw Daddy in the city, which is another great seafood restaurant!!
The lobster/crab rolls and fried calamari/Cajun wings I recommend. Great service and we also received complimentary oysters!Pricier than the average menu, but you get what you pay for. They also have a full bar with flatscreen TVs. Great decor as well. Check it out!
We were seated right away on a Friday night. The place is good for groups. What was supposed to be a date night turned into a family dinner outing. The general seating area can be a little loud- but the ambience was nice and welcoming. The FOOD- Fried Calamari, Grilled Corn, Fresh clams, and Cajun wings. Not a big fan of fried foods but clams were a big hit. The sauce that came with the calamari was delish. Grilled Corn was Mexican style with the butter and cheese. We had 2.  Entree- Uni Pasta- For those who like Uni- I hear this is your go to. We had a few Uni lovers and the Loved the pasta. Boils- My boyfriend and I shared a boil combo together of mild Cajun seasoning. It still had a kick to it. Some ordered the garlic butter mild with their combo and thought it was still a bit spicy. Each boil comes with a corn and half a potato in the seasoning. Dessert- Green Tea Tiramisu, Cafe Creme Brûlée and I think it was Strawberry Shortcake-Not a big fan of matcha powder sprinkled on my cake but it did have a strong green tea flavor. Creme Brûlée was rich and the Strawberry Shortcake was everyone's favorite because of the small bits in the flavorful strawberry ice cream. Nelson was polite and entertaining during our visit and we look forward to going again for some good seafood boils.
I despise establishments that have their friends post fake 5 star reviews to lure people in and I'm suspecting all these 5 star reviews are not all that genuine. Good restaurants are supposed to catch attention through real word of mouth. The food is supposed to do most of the talking! Within the Asian community, if a restaurant is good the crowd will automatically follow. Because in Asian culture food is king and if its good we will line up for it in hordes. As a matter of fact, Asians (predominantly Chinese folks) will line up just for the sake of lining up if they see a line; this is even before they know what the hell they are lining up for. Unfortunately of all my friends who tried Naked Crab none have recommended this place when it was brought up.   However even with a lack of praise from my friends I still decided to give them a try. I am all about trying new spots in the neighborhood and I wholeheartedly want such businesses to succeed, especially when its something fresh and new. Within the past couple of years several restaurants have given the whole creole seafood thing a stab and have failed miserably. This is mainly because the owners of these joints want to open shop based solely on how successful such restaurants have proven be however they have NO FUCKING CLUE on how to make the food. The restaurant looked the part and it seems like a pretty penny was used for the construction. A rather large restaurant for Flushing, built to support a lot of diners at once but on my visit they only had 3-4 tables on a Saturday night. We were actually a bit perplexed why the place was nearly empty during its 2nd week of opening,well this was until the food came. Of all the things we had that night, the best tasting were the Cajun wings and the garlic bread. Their Cajun/house sauce was flavorless and soulless... just tasted like peppered salty water mixed in old bay. Moreover they didn't have a few things on the menu with one being CRAWFISH.-Fail! For the Cajun boil we ordered the snow crab combo which consisted of snow crab, clams, shrimp and king crab which we added since they didn't have crawfish.. The seafood was very low grade, the king crab legs were tiny, mushy and super salty, the snow crabs were also very salty while the shrimp and clams were overcooked and rubbery. The potato and the corn did not absorb any of the flavors of the boil either. Most of the ingredients put into the boil were previously frozen and the flavor profiles of broth did not mask the "previously frozen" taste very well. The spices used seemed very low grade and tinny, think large format cafeteria grade spices. Seems like they spent all the money into building the restaurant but sloppily slapped the menu together and hired any random chef to make the food. The servers were very attentive and polite, I felt their enthusiasm and hopeful energy. Towards the end of dinner we were even offered a free round of drinks on the house which was a very nice gesture. They also have happy hour for drinks, dollars wings and oysters which is cool. Unfortunately as I previously mentioned I got the impression that the owners are simply trying to cash in on the southern craw-fish craze that started in Louisiana then migrated to Cali while having no clue how it's made. In Cali I've had some of the best damn crawfish in my life from a spot called Boiling crab. Currently the only half decent offering of this creole style seafood can be found at The Boil in Manhattan. Based on our experience, Naked Crab fell so short I wouldn't recommend it. This is why the folks down south who have been making these boils for years guard their recipes for dear life. Such recipes as they are passed down from generation to generation as family secrets. Naked crab like so many others got this all wrong, restaurants of this type succeed because the people who made such food have been doing so for their family and friends for years and most likely had their friends and family encourage them to open shop. After my visit here I would really suggest that if they are to succeed, they really need to rethink the formulas and recipes of the boils. First impressions are key at any restaurant and this was a huge disappointment.
We found our new Cajun seafood boil place! Great happy hour specials (3-7pm or all day at the bar). $6 cocktails, $5 beer and wine, $1 oysters and $1.50 grilled oysters. We ordered a dozen of the raw oysters and they were quite large. We also ordered the snow crab combo with the whole shebang sauce. Delicious, and even at medium spicy it was not too hot. It came with two corns and potatoes, but we added sausage for $3. Prices aren't terrible, though expect to spend at least $60 for two people. Many other food options aside from seafood boil as well. Shrimp salad, pastas, soup, fries, etc. We'll be coming back!
Came here for Sunday dinner, because a few friends had recommended the spot saying that there was a new spot with great seafood. I gotta say the seafood here is extremely FRESH! We got the grilled clams (Must try), lamb chops (Tender/Amazing), raw clams/oysters *(Fresh), chicken wings/fries (Crunchy), and most importantly the seafood boil (Must GET). For our seafood boil we tried the lobster/shrimp/crab all of which were good, but I would go with the shrimp/crab for next time!I would proceed with caution if you're going to get anything with the medium spice! It has got a ton of kick to it!
Great food and great customer service. The boil platters are amazing, the happy hour oysters, cajun wings and the best part was the broiled clams- they are simply amazing! We tried all the deserts and they were great, green tea crembrulee, regular crembrulee and tartufo. The ambiance was upbeat and happy, music was great! I would recommend to sea food lovers and anyone looking to enjoy some good food w great service.
Food was awesome. Seafood was so fresh it's sweet to the taste. Definitely try the raw oysters and clams, followed by smoked salmon arugula salad, then the seafood broil, Alaskan king crab legs, snow crab and shrimp. Finally top off with the uni pasta.  If you have a sweet tooth, try the homemade creme brulee. Will be back soon.
The raw oyster and clams are very clean and fresh and the uni pasta was fantastic. But, I would stray away from the garlic and butter flavor boiled seafood that doesn't taste like garlic butter at all. The mussels had to be sent back because it wasn't fresh and the king snow crab legs had like four bites of meat inside, not worth $38 dollars. Wouldn't be coming back.
Came to try the new place out with a group of friends on Sunday night. Maybe we came on a off day because we don't know how the place has such rave reviews. We ordered brussel sprouts, shrimp avocado salad, mushroom soups and corn as appetizers. The soup was the best part. Do not try the squid ink or uni pasta! Stench was so bad it was inedible. None of it was fresh. The boil itself was okay. Bill came out to $250 and we left the restaurant hungry. *btw- they charge for refills on soft drinks. We were charged $3 a cup for seltzer. Place was definitely not worth the trip.
The food was amazing! The service was great.. my SO and I started with 2 orders of clams which were cohoag .. they were very tender but too big for my liking! Afterwards we had a shrimp and avocado salad which was PHENOMENAL ! Absolutely delicious! I had the rack of lamb that came with Brussel sprouts, mushrooms and mashed potatoes !  my boyfriend could not keep his eyes off of my plate ! Lamb was prepared PERFECTLY (medium rare). HE had scallops that were accompanied by asparagus with mashed potatoes .. although he isn't big on asparagus he says they were cooked perfectly and they were delicious I would definitely come here again..
They did a great job with the decor at this restaurant. however let's talk about the food. My girlfriend and I ordered oysters and drinks since it was happy hour. This was the highlight of the meal. Oysters were meaty and fresh and the drinks were fine. We also ordered lobster, shrimp, crawfish, corn and potatoes for the boil. I have to say the boil was disappointing. It tasted like the ingredients were boiled in water and the tossed in the sauce. Corn and potatoes are usually my favorite part of a boil however in this case they tasted bland. The flavors did not penetrate at all. I would definitely recommend Naked Crab for their HH but not the boil. Tip For those using Groupon, HH items do not apply.
This is a first time I went to this restaurant with my friends. The servers are so nice and the food is so great. I strongly recommend the squid ink pasta, grilled lobster with cheese and the boils for Dungeness Crab, I chose the naked sauce. Also the cocktails I recommend red wedding. I really like this place.
The sauce and marinade was very lackluster. Additionally, I paid 36 dollars for one small lobster and about six clams. The service was nonexsistant yet when it came to paying tips, they had the audacity to ask for more than what I thought was appropriate. The ambiance was not what I expected. Overall, the amount of food I paid for was not up to par. I felt very disappointed and suggest that potential customers spend their money else where.
If I can give it no stars, I would.  I'm completely shock with all the recent reviews giving it rave reviews.  This place is by far the worse boil seafood restaurant I've eaten.  Let me break it down for you.Pro:1.  Ambiance2.  The non-seafood side items were more edible than the seafood (corn, cajun fries, etc)Con:1. Made reservation and when arrived I was told it's not reflected in their system.  Had to wait as if I just walked in.  Not a happy camper to start off.2.  Once seated, waited for someone to provide us menu and water.  After a while, had to ask for them.  You would think after having a bad start with a new customer, they would have comp an appetizer or a drink to show good faith in business.  But that never happened.3.  The grilled oyster is so bland.4.  My king crab boil was served 20 minutes prior to my husband lobster roll.  Isn't it quicker to make lobster roll than the boil dish?5.  The naked sauce is awful compare to The Boil's sauce.  It's watery and just taste awful6.  The most annoying part, the seafood was not fresh at all.  The crab was stuck onto the shell.  The meat does not come off easily and it tasted like rubber band.  For the same price as the other establishment, I would definitely prefer to go back to them.  Of all places I've gone between the boil, claw daddy's and cajun sea, this place is by far the worse establishment.  We will never go back to this place.  We were looking forward to going to this place as a date night, but it quickly turned south.  We would rather make the extra commute into the city for better quality and tasty food.  If you were to conduct a focus group between naked crab's food vs the other establishments, you will see the the final result study would support my reviews.
This place is AMAZING. Great service. The owner was extremely generous. Hooked me up with a free drink  would definitely come back.
I came here with my boyfriend. This restaurant is reasonable in size and definitely has potential. For some reason, big groups can't use more than one $30 off for two groupons. Not sure why they can't just split the bills and use the groupons separately. My only complaints are the portions being too small, and the quality was average for the price we paid including tip and tax. Spent about $80 for two here. 3 stars for the good staff and happy hour specials.
They're obviously trying to copy paste "the boil" in manhattan. I tried the fried chicken wing and the lobster sashimi. Terrible, $25 for like eight tiny pieces of lobster. And the the main course boil stuff I tried snow crab and shrimp. TBH the potato and the corn was good. But none of their sauce was good at all. I just can't understand why so many people give them five stars. Not that pricy after all but just don't worth it. Don't go.
first time here with my boyfriend- had mac&cheese for appetizer and ordered 1lb snow crabs with corn, potato and sausage with garlic herb seasoning. both tasted good & will deff come back again!
food was good！little expensive tho，so make sure to check Groupon before you go，cuz sometimes they have great deal there！
My overall experience at naked crab was below mediocre. This restaurant has decor that make feel like I'm at a happy hour in soho, but... food is very overpriced and waiters served scanty portions.  The Lobster boil with a small stick of corn and clams and small lobster was about $40. So not worth it. A large shrimp I can find in a Chinese supermarket down the block has more meat than the lobster in the boil. There were only about 3 clams (meatless)  in there with sad broth.  Appetizer stick of corn $3 and greasy Brussels sprouts for $7. Sad. Uni pasta $28 was a small handful of cheap pasta with a tablespoon of uni. Step up your game. Turn down the volume of the radio station so we can actually fucking order and not get the wrong dish of eggs with scallops. Rant over
Com here with my girl friend on Friday night between happy hour ,but the happy hour be come a disaster hour .... The reason I want to try this restaurant is because Groupon . However, they won't let me use it on the happy hour, Okay is fine not a big deal. Your dishes are so little small for a big Price even on the happy hour . The food tastes just so so but the portion is small. it doesn't worth the price you put on the menu. I'll never comeback again . I spent over hundred dollar for two people and walk out still hungry, I feel really disappoint.
I came here on a Monday night after for thoroughly searching for a place in queens that had a late happy hour and served oysters. I found a gem! We ordered raw oysters, baked oysters and clams, cajun wings, and lobster roll. Everything was great. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive. The drinks were good for a happy hour I must say. It also was not crowded at all which I enjoyed having enough space at the bar. I will definitely return.
The food and customer service was very good. Jasmine was attentive to my table and was very helpful. I'll definitely be coming back again and will be bringing friends. - the Hulk
Love this place to totally. Nice music. Great place to chill. Boils are so good. We got that free 1 Lb of shrimp for free. love the place. will come back again definitely.
No frills. Love the happy hour. I ordered 1 lb of snow crab legs and Mac and cheese with lobster. It was so good. I would come back again. Staff was friendly. Food came on time. It wasn't a ridiculous wait like at the boil. I was stuffed and happy!
This was my first exciting dinner experience with my friends. Yesterday we tried new sauce named Sha-Bang which is good. We want to eat again next weekend.
If you love eating with your hands, this place is for you.  The sauces are all curry based so be warned.  The baked clams and oysters are good as an appetizer. All the seafood is per pound when you order, so if you love seafood it could be quite expensive. They offer other items besides seafood, you can also have steak.
Food was very good,service was very good. Nice atmosphere. Lobster was cooked perfect. Oysters were fresh and good and cold. I will recommend this restaurant to all my friends.
Naked crab has amazing seafood and it's extremely fresh. The staff is very friendly. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. And they play great music.
Came here with my husband on a Friday night after work not knowing what to expect.I was pleasantly surprised by the experience. The service was very warm and attentive. Even the chef who concocted the sauce for our seafood boil came out to greet us at the end of the meal! The seafood was very fresh, especially taking into consideration the location of this place (Flushing, Queens) where owning a restaurant is so competitive! I was reluctant to order the raw oysters (only $1 each during happy hour) because I had a bad experience with raw oysters before at another restaurant. But after trying them here, now I realize why people love raw oysters so much--they were fresh and clean (none of that fishy taste) and just slid down my throat....so good!At the waitresses' recommendation, we ordered the Snow crab combo which came with snow crab legs, shrimp, potatoes and corn. Again, very fresh seafood and those shrimp were HUGE! You get to choose from 4 different sauces and we chose the one with butter, garlic, cilantro, and siracha. It was really good:)We also ordered cajun fries and cold mussels topped with chopped corn, onion, cliantro, and garlic. Finally, at the owner's recommendation, we tried the Uni pasta. Oh man was it good! You could tell that they put a lot of uni into the sauce, which was sooooo creamy. One bite was never enough. I took one bite and kept going back for more!There were so many other things on the menu that I wanted to try, so I'm definitely coming back!!!!
Found this jewel on yelp. The owner moved his car so we could park. All of the staff and sercice were great. Food was awesome, and my 17 year old is a picky seafood eater.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant.
Came here to meet a group of friends and also had my toddler with me. My waitress was super helpful with making sure my kid was comfortable. I had the garlic noodles. AMAZING! Had the snob crab boil with the 3 sauces mixture on the side and it was soooooo good. I had the grilled oysters which were delicious. Tried a chicken wing, which was good but the little one stole it from me and ate it herself. Drinks were potent and personally delivered to the table by the owner.
I love this restaurant . The food is excellent  with 5 different sauces you can choose from . And the service is great with a friendly atmosphere  .
Staff is great! Food and drinks are worth the trip. Good atmosphere to relax and talk.
Saw this place on a whim, and decided to check it out. Excellent! Has a seafood southern style with Asian influence. Oysters were great (very fresh) and the crab cigars was a really cool take on an egg roll but filled with crab meat (delicious!)
Super fresh seafood !! The uni pasta is a amazing!!! The foie gras is delicious!!! The raw oyster melts in your mouth.  I give 10 stars to this place.  Definitely recommend this place to seafood lovers. I can't wait to go back and try the lamb and steak. The drinks was good as well.
Very good food.  The staff are friendly and it's nice to go here for lunch. Cheap and cheerful but bad parking.
Staying at the Parc Hotel, came in for appetizers and drinks. Very good calamari and shrimp -avocado salad. Very nice staff , very accommodating and personable. Really enjoyed the atmosphere in this restaurant, would definitely come back to have dinner if we had the time!
The service was extremely bad. The waitress who served us was too impolite. I have so much complain to say but doesn't even bother to type a word for this restaurant.
First time here, we've ordered hh 1 1/2 dz raw oyster, hh grilled oyster, 1/2 dz raw clams, bone marrow, lobster roll, foie gras and lobster combo. Overall food is pretty good but the lobster  roll and lobster combo kinda dragged down the rating so I gave a 3star. Raw oyster and clam are fresh so that's a plus but 3 out of a dozen you will happen to find cracked shells or sands in it(or maybe I am the lucky one)! Grilled oyster and bone marrow tasty. Foie gras $20 for the size of the foie gras is reasonable but too bland. The lobster roll pretty disappointed, the meat texture like frozen lobster meat bland as well and if I am paying $19.5 for it I am expecting at least decent meat not frozen! I've had lobster rolls at many place and I can say the lobster roll here is not acceptable. The lobster combo $35 we ordered garlic with butter, too much sauce and basically covered up all the seafood taste(also being said the lobster might not be fresh) lobster less than a lb and with just  7-8shrimp  1 potatoe 1 corn not sure if it's worth that price. The services is fairly good. Will I return? Most likely No.
Service was great, and since it wasnt too busy, they offered the $35/person special for me and my mom. The special included almost everything, garlic bread, snow crab legs, shrimp, clam, mussels, sausage, corn and potato. The garlic butter and cajun sauce was not bad but maybe because they simply threw the food onto the wax paper on the table in front of us, it made it kind of cold in a short period of time.  I was expecting it to be contained in those clear plastic bags that I saw other tables had but it was different in our case.  Overall, the food and service was not bad but I would prefer to go back to The Boil instead.
Took our nephew and his girlfriend here during their NYC visit as they wanted to try some east coast oysters. We ordered the Sampler and it did not disappoint! The snow crab boil and the lobster boil were tasty too!  We ordered all the flavors but the lemon and pepper, medium spicy and less spicy. I prefer the medium spicy. We ordered the sliders and I loved the fried oyster one. I think I'll order some fried oysters the next time I'm there. The place was decorated so that it felt like we were by the docks and they were catching our meal nearby!
Good Food, Big Portions And Great Service!!! The Music Is Poppin And The Happy Hour Is The Best!
excellent place,  went today for the first time,  and i have to say i was impressed with the quality of the food,  took advantage of the "happy Hour"  promo, from 3 pm to 7pm, and had a dozen oysters for a $1 each 6 grilled clams for $1.50 and 3 cajum wing for $1.00 each,  everything was delicious,  the service was awesome,  always attentive,  asked for my wings to be "not spicy"  and the cheff was able to accomodate to our desire,  since the wings have cajun sauce over it,  definitely recommended,  will come back soon.
One star for crappy management! We had a 30 dollar off the bill Groupon (spent 18 so basically they lose 12 bucks) I told the waitress I had a Groupon she said we can't use it for happy hour so we thought that's fine cause we ordered happy hour items and 4 boiled items and the umi pasta so the bill came out to 250 bucks they wouldn't let us use the Groupon cause we bought a couple of happy hour items so it was either choose happy hour price (which deducted only 15 bucks off the bill) or choose Groupon and we kept saying waitress said this and the management kept saying you can't combine cause we lose money THEN DONT DO A GROUPON AND HAPPY HOUR he made us so upset especially because our bill was 250 after speaking to waitress he finally took it off cause she said it was miscommunication but he doesn't realize because he was so concerned of losing (12 bucks really not 30) off a 250 dollar bill that he would lose customers FOREVER and now we will never go back cause too bad we did enjoy it.  It's common sense please the customer because we would have been so appreciative and want to go back and spend another 250 bucks without a Groupon. Good job CHEAP jerk
I went there with my 2 yr old toddler and husband. Husband was not impressed with the food. I was ok. Service wasn't that great, maybe our server was new? But it took a while to acknowledge us after we got seated. Fried calamari sauce is definitely more Asian style based. My husband was expecting more Italian style. The dip was a sweet and sour sauce. I got some sausages, which looks like they were slivered from some kielbasa I can get whole from the supermarket for $3.29 and i was charged $3. I went there for the raw bar - clams hit the spot and was quite fresh. Squid ink pasta was alright. It more like squid ink sauce instead of the pasta itself that's black. Seafood is definitely fresh. But i wouldn't call this place family friendly. This is right by Skyview, so I guess they're trying to make it fancy. But I wouldn't go out of my way to return for the price I paid and not much choices for my 2 yr old.
Love love the garlic noodles!! Love the chicken!! Love the steak!! Love the corn!! Love the deserts !! Love the drinks especially "love affair", its great for the weather. The restaurant is cozy and everyone has great vibes. Lets just say you do not have to eat seafood to come to Naked Crab and love it. My new favorite spot.
Rack of lamb, duck breast, lobster roll, and Cajun boils are all delicious! Parking is easy! Definitely come back!
Great service, great food. Such a great market for the supply and demand in the best location. I see great success in the future. Drove from New Jersey to try this restaurant. Can't wait to come back!
